    "\n",
    "- `accuracy_score`: *Accuracy* counts the number of data points in the test set that have been predicted correctly, and returns that number as a fraction of the test set size. Sticking to the example of classifying pictures as cats or dogs, accuracy indicates the fraction of pictures that have been correctly classified as containing either a cat or a dog. This is the most basic scoring function for classifiers.\n",
    "- `precision_score`: *Precision* describes the ability of a classifier not to label as \"cat\" a picture that contains a dog. In other words, out of all the pictures in the test set that the classifier thinks contain a cat, precision is the fraction of pictures that actually contain a cat.\n",
    "- `recall_score`: *Recall* (or *sensitivity*) describes the ability of a classifier to retrieve all the pictures that contain a cat. In other words, out of all the pictures of cats in the test set, recall is the fraction of pictures that have been correctly identified as pictures of cats."
