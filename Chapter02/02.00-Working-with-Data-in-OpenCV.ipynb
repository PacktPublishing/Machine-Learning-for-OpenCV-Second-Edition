    "Now that we have whetted our appetite for machine learning, it is time to delve a little\n",
    "deeper into the different parts that make up a typical machine learning system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is all about building mathematical models in order\n",
    "to understand data. The learning aspect enters this process when we give a machine\n",
    "learning model the capability to adjust its **internal parameters**; we can tweak these\n",
    "parameters so that the model explains the data better. In a sense, this can be understood as\n",
    "the model learning from the data. Once the model has learned enough—whatever that\n",
    "means—we can ask it to explain newly observed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence machine learning problems are always split into (at least) two\n",
    "distinct phases:\n",
    "- A **training phase**, during which we aim to train a machine learning model on a set of data that we call the **training dataset**.\n",
    "- A **test phase**, during which we evaluate the learned (or finalized) machine learning model on a new set of never-before-seen data that we call the **test dataset**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of splitting our data into a training set and test set cannot be understated.\n",
    "We always evaluate our models on an independent test set because we are interested in\n",
    "knowing how well our models generalize to new data. In the end, isn't this what learning is\n",
    "all about—be it machine learning or human learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is also all about the **data**.\n",
    "Data can be anything from images and movies to text\n",
    "documents and audio files. Therefore, in its raw form, data might be made of pixels, letters,\n",
    "words, or even worse: pure bits. It is easy to see that data in such a raw form might not be\n",
    "very convenient to work with. Instead, we have to find ways to **preprocess** the data in order\n",
    "to bring it into a form that is easy to parse.\n",

    "- What does a typical machine learning workflow look like?\n",
    "- What are training data, validation data, and test data - and what are they good for?\n",
