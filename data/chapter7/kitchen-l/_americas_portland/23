Louise,

A third party developer wants to pay us a small fee ($75K - $100K) for the right to use EOL.  They own LM6000's and want to buy puts.  Understandably we offered them a very high premium and a very low strike so they instead want to pay us for the distribtion channel.   Even though they may be competing with our turbine position, I think we should do it subject to legal.   Steve Thome is talking with Brad Richter about it.

Please let me know if you disagree.

Regards,


Chris Calger
