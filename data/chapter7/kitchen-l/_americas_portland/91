We signed last night with Black Hills Energy Capital.  They have till 5:00PM Thursday to deliver either the LC or the Corp guaranty.

We are not done.  On Friday when we were prepared to sign, Black Hills Energy Capital said they needed until today to get a signature from their parent, Black Hills Corp.  At noon today they said that the signature was on its way.  At 4:00PM we heard that they will issue a L/C instead of the Corp guarantee.  The L/C approach is fine, but I am concerned with this flaky behavior.

Our plan is to sign the purchase and sale with Black Hills Energy Capital tonight/tomorrow morning.  They would have the obligation to deliver either a gurantee or an L/C for $15MM by Thursday.  If not, we can terminate at any time prior to close of business Monday.  I will update when something changes.
