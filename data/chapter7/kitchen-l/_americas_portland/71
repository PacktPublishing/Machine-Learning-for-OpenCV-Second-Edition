His asst. called to let you know he will be out of the office for the rest of the week.  His wife is in the hospital and has been for the last 2 1/2 weeks with pregnancy complications.  They are suppose to induce her(not sure exactly when) and she thought Chris might be back in the office on Monday.  He will be checking his voicemail and emails and will probably call in to the office a couple times a day.

I will be sure to send flowers when the baby arrives.
