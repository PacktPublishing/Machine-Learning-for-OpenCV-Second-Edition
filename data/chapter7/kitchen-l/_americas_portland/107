Louise:

Tim Belden forwarded to me the files shown below for "soft targets for Q1."  It appears these reports are to track Middle Market transactions company wide.  However, the data does not match our records.  Attached is a recent report indicating Portland Middle Market year to date earnings of about $27 million and 163 transactions.  We also have the Services Desk here in Portland run by Greg Wolfe that is up an additional $3 million or so year to date. Can you give me the name of an individual who is involved with the reports below so I can contact them and figure out why our numbers differ from those in the reports below? 


Thanks!

Chris
