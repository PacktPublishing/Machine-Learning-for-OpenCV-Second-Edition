Still like CDWR - PG&E bankruptcy was not expected today, but not a big surprise overall.  

Fountain Valley looks like $16.6MM - half in QII , half in QIII

Cheers

Thanks for this - how do you feel about the cdwr today?

Superb news on Fountain Valley - are you still thinking $17m.

Louise,

Turbine Swap:
The Hancock letters were acceptable to Chip and me.  Legal got comfort from GE that the consent language will be consistent with what we have done before.  Based on that, we got done with Delta and GE.  We are preparing the definitive agreements for Delta in order to keep the pressure on them to close and fund mid-month - ultimate drop-dead is May 3.

Pastoria:
Pre-closed yesterday; funds will flow April 11 

Fountain Valley:
Pre-closed this morning; funds will flow April 11 (need 5 business day notice for turbopark)

DWR:
Discussions continue (calm after the storm) - I am trying to push them towards a deal that has less up-front credit exposure.  It might look like a June start with volumes increasing later in 2001

Roseville:
Approval requests will come in two phases - a $1MM "I-DASH" early next week for an option on ERC's and some environmental consulting work.  A Big DASH ($45MM) in a couple of weeks for the full project development budget.   

Goldendale:
Giving them a non-binding proposal tomorrow to buy the project - I will get on your calender to update

Las Vegas:
Putting together toll, EPC, final development - will get on your calender next week to review

INGA:
Decision over the next couple of days to launch a binding bid to Ahlstrom to try to get their attention - or just kill the file

Regards,

Chris
