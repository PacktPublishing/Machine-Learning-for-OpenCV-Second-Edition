California Power Authority ("CPA") held its first meeting with developers last week.  We attended and presented ourselves as a potential developer and seller of turbines to either the CPA or CPA developers.   CPA has issued a form of non-binding LOI for interested developers to sign.  It needs to be signed in the next 24 hours (!) in order to stay in the CPA program.   I would like to do that (subject to legal edits) so that we can stay at the table.  

I bring this to your attention because it may be press-released that we have reached agreement with CPA and that we are offering to build a project for the CPA. 

Please let me know if you have any issues with this.

Regards,

Chris Calger
