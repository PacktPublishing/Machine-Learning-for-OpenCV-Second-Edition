Calgary is done.  Ben is done.  Brett was in agreement verbally and with the first draft (he did not say done on the final draft because he left town till July 12, but Ben and I believe he is done).

Will do on the update every couple of weeks

Shock, horror we ended up at $30mm!  

Seems fine by me.  I presume the guys in Calgary are all happy with this way forward.  

Thanks for getting this done.  I am assuming that we are now done on this.  Can we get a strategy update on all the turbines going forward once every couple of weeks?
