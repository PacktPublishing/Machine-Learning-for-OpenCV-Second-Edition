Louise,

Per the request of Bill Bradford, attached please find an initial draft of the DASH for the DWR put option.  Please note that we are waiting on a final, legal risk memorandum as well as comments from Jim Steffes for the regulatory risks.

Please let us know if you have any questions or initial comments.

Regards,
Tracy
