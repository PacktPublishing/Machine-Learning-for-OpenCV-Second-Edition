Louise,

Chris Calger mentioned that you had some questions regarding Fort Pierce and restrictions on their ability to assume liability by virtue of their status as a municipality.  I don't know if I've charactrized this correctly, but I've never heard of such a restriction, although it may be a Florida law provision I've never come across.  If I can be of any help running this to ground please let me know.  

Mike
