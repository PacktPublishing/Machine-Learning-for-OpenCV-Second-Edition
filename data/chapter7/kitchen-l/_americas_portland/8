Louise:

A termination of equipment associated with the Longview project on or before 10/31/01 will require Enron to write-off approximately $23 million, not inclusive of approximately $3 million in development costs to date.
To extend orders for equipment to 11/30/01 will cost an additional $5.3 million in cancellation charges.
To extend orders for equipment to 12/31/01 will cost an additional $8.7 million (inclusive of the $5.3 million above, therefore, net $3.4 million) in cancellation charges.

Termination at any time between now and year-end 2001 provides no material recovery potential for money spent.
