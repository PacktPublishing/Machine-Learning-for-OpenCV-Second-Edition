It might be easier (for the sake of time) to just take the DPR numbers and split it out be originator.

These are the aggregate numbers:

Foster			37,642,000
Wolfe			5,678,000
Thomas/Macdonald	5,188,000
Parquet			77,191,000
Calger			7,000,000

Thanks

These are the origination numbers by Deal Maker that we are using for PRC purposes, can you check your guys and let Faith know today if there are any discrepencies.

Subject:	Originations Schedule

Hi Louise,

As requested, attached is a file that contains June YTD Originations by Originator.

We've arranged the file in the following sorts:

?	by team
?	by Originator (sorted alphabetically)
?	by Originator (sorted by value)
?	Top 10 Overall Originators by Value
?	Top 10 Originators- Gas
?	Top 10 Originators- Power

An item to note is that not all deals had a related individual's name (such as Enduser)- we left the listing as it appears in the Risk Book in these cases.

We'll send you an update if the DPR amounts move (the DPR isn't final yet.)

Please let me know if you need any additional information!
