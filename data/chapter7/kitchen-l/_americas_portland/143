I was incorrect.  The existing non-recourse debt for Las Vegas ($55MM) is off-balance sheet and off-credit.  It does not show up as a liability on our balance sheet and it is not part of our footnotes.   If the plant blew up, we would be out $24MM, not $79MM.  We get this treatment because it is a fair market value asset and we have a Friend of Enron minority investor that keeps our stated interest below 50%.  Our interest for control purposes is over 50% because we have a call option on the Friend of Enron shares.
