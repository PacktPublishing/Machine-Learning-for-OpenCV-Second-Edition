fyi "done" means that I talked with Forster about the industrial split and sent him the Lavo/Delainey memo.  I did not talk to him about the gray areas re utilities, generators, etc. - my understanding is that that is not resolved/clear.

Could you spend some time explaining the whole split (customers) to Dave Forster.  Duran and Ader have given up and Dave has taken over from Duran to sort it out.
