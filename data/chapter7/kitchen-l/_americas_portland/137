Presentation and Resolution will be finalized in a few hours.  I just gave my final comments to Chip and Jonalan Page (my group) on the DASH.  JonAlan will walk it around and get it to you and Mark.  Chip said he will get Glisan and Jeff's signature.   Chip wanted to know if Jeff was aware of this coming around for signature.

LVC II is the only deal I know of requiring BoD approval.  FYI--Inga is swirling around again--BoD approval will not be required if a decision is made to move ahead near the price point approved in December.
