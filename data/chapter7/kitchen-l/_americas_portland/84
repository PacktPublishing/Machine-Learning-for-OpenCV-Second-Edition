Thanks Louise for all of your help with the Portland contracts.  I know they weren't easy and I really appreciate the support.

Have a great day!
Amy

I gave all the signed contract approvals to Kim Melodick as David is out.  I have signed them all but David hasn't.  I have kept all the original numbers as submitted by Chris and expect David to sign on this basis (ie original Chris numbers not David's changes).

Please sort out drafting for Chris.

Thanks

Louise

(ps I even signed Mike's!)
