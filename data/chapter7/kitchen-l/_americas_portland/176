We had a bad accident at the construction site on Friday.  A construction worker slipped and fell in front of a bulldozer.  Over the weekend he had his foot amputated.  We have flown his family in and put them up at a Ronald Mcdonald House (non-profit institution for families of injured/ill patients).  The worker was employed by a sub-contractor of CIG, the pipeline company that is constructing the gas lateral for Fountain Valley Power LLC.

NEPCO is making some noise because they want it to be clear that this was not a NEPCO subcontractor and therefore not NEPCO responsibility.   We do not think this will materially delay closing the sale to Black Hills, but we will likely need to indemnify them from the litigation risk associated with this accident.  We are working with legal and insurance to assess risk and process.
