FYI -we negotiated a unilateral management out through next Friday so I suspect there will be some internal discussion about the toll early next week.  Since Chip and Brian were plugged in every step of the way I hope we wont try to reneg on the deal, but if we made a big mistake late last night we could go back to  Allegheny.  Should not be a problem, but thought you should know.
