I called him at home last night.  His absence from the office this week was somewhat unplanned.  He is at home with his kids as his mother inlaw is taking a break for the week (remember, he has four kids, including a two-month old baby and his son Erik who has had a variety of health problems).  He is planning on coming in at the end of the week to interview some internal people for a job on the services desk.  I agree that it looks like he is out of here, but he gave me no indication.  I think that we should sit tight for a few days.  I will know when he's coming in to do the services interviews.  Perhaps Amy should have a conversation with him at that time.
