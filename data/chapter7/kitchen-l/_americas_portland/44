Does not change our behavior/motivations, but it may change how we structure a sale that is combined with one of our sites.

Enron Corp does so it shouldn't make any difference who wears it - right?

Louise,

Do we continue to wear the risk/reward and carrying charges on the Mitsubishis?

Is there any possibility of negotiating a way out of the Mitsubishi contracts by paying them a fee.  I know we have no cancellation charge but can we just say we will pay them $10mm to cancel the contracts?  If we could do we want to do this?  

How much money would we lose (how much of a write down would we take) if I told you I wanted to get rid of the turbines by the end of September?  

As an aside, the Mitsubishis will be leaving the Enron Americas Balance Sheet now and moving to EGAS.  This does not and should not however change anything in terms of how we are moving forward.  For the company overall, we need to move these turbines (as with all the others) as soon as possible and we (in the Americas) are in a much better position than EGAS is to move them.  I have spoken to Jim on this issue who is obviously in agreement with the way forward.
