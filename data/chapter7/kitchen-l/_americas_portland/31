We executed the purchase and sale agreement today.  Closing should occur in late October/early November and is subject only to bank and partner consents.  Bank consent will require NRG getting a  legal opinion on NRG's ability to close without violating QF status (we believe this is a non-issue but will require some handholding).  Our internal and Sale proceeds will be approx $20.793MM split between JEDI and ENA.
