Louise,

I spoke to Chip and he mentioned your concern/question about the financing of this project.  To be clear, the turbines and some of the equipment are in Turbopark.  However, Global Finance does not want to construct this project inside of Turbopark because Accounting believes that would be problematic for our fair market value treatment of our merchant investments.  Global Finance's plan is to provide a JEDI II/ENA bridge loan to the project for the non-turbine construction costs through a bridge loan from May 1 through Sep 30.  The expected loan amount during this time period is $30MM, split between ENA and JEDI II.  Our economics assume the bridge loan is priced at 15%.  Global Finance has committed to arrange non-recourse project financing so that ENA/JEDI will have only a $40MM combined investment once the financing closes by Sep 30.  Also during this time period we will be actively marketing the project with the intent to divest of it fully prior to Sep 30.

Hopefully that clarifies things.

Regards,

Chris
