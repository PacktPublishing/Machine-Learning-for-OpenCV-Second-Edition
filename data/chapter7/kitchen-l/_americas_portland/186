On our two quotes, my comment on the first quote is important; the second might sound a little better but says the same thing.  

The Pastoria Energy Center represents the second major power project developed in California by Enron since 1999, ...

Enron remains committed to helping meet the growing need for reliable and affordable electricity in California through the development of other highly efficient projects.

My only comment is that the project is referred to Pastoria Energy Facility and Pastoria Energy Center.  The name of the LLC is Pastoria Energy Facility LLC.  Calpine's wholly-owned sub, Pasotia Energy Center LLC, will be purchasing 100% of ENA's membership interest in Pastoria Energy Facility.
