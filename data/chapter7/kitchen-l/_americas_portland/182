I am just tracking down the third 7FA you previously had outlined for Pastoria expansion.  As I understand this it went (as an option) in the sale to Calpine.  However in all the turbine reports it shows up as a firm commitment that ENA holds.  Which one is right - is it gone or do we still have it?
