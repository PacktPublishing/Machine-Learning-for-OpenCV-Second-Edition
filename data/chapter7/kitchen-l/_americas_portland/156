Bankruptcy in California; Implications for our Growth Energy Names

*	We would not sell Energy Merchants/Power Producers on news that PCG
has declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
*	Ongoing payments in California are being made by the state;
therefore do not anticipate material exposure for ongoing earnings.
*	Primary exposure is current receivables: (1) these one-time amounts
are limited (roughly estimate max. of 50% of 2001 earnings); and (2) we
expect that, as trade creditors, they will get high priority in a bankruptcy
proceeding. We think most of these amounts are likely to be recoverable,
although a significant (perhaps several year) delay is possible as these
claimants work their way through the bankruptcy process.
*	By our rough estimation, companies with fairly significant one-time
earnings exposure include:  NRG, MIR, DYN, CPN.  Companies with fairly small
exposure include:  ENE, AES, WMB, EPG and DUK.
