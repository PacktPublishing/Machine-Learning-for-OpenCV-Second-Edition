Good question.  I think he has experience using other people's money to get asset deals done - worth asking.  Answer probably depends on a gut feel on how we answer the questions:

Is something changing that increases the number of potential counterparties?
Is something changing that increases the number of products/risks that we can intermediate?
If answer is yes - perhaps we just need more good mid-marketers.
If answer is no - maybe we need someone that can look at bigger regional issues - infrastructure, cross-border basis, etc. 

Have him based in Houston and go for it for 12 months.  If nothing materializes, it's a small investment for a large, neighboring country.

The question is - with our capital constraints - is he the right guy?
