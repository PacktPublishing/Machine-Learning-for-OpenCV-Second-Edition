Attached please find a black-lined version of the Amendment of the DeAcero Power Sale Agreement which incorporates the revisions recently discussed.
Also attached is a clean version of the Amendment.

Max, Drew has requested that you confirm the charges listed in the table in paragraph 1 of Exhibit A.  If any of these numbers are in error, please advise and I will revise them.

Please call with questions or comments.  If no revisions are necessary, please advise and I will initial the letter for signature.
