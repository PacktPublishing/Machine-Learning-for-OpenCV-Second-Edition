He is a scrap-metal dealer from Australia who has set up an office in the EconoLodge hotel in Pittsburgh and wants to sell a $3.5 million turbine to Enron for $35 million in order to finance his acquisition of a steel plant in Ohio which produces a kind of steel which is not of interest to our steel group (the plant produces a type of steel used in crankshafts).

He doesn't have any money or other security. 

Dave

Was originally passed to me from you.

Is a time-waster and is threatening to call you again.

See me if you want details.
