This will be a frequent report until we get all the quotes up and running.  In most cases, the missing quotes were quickly available through a direct phone call.  I left a mesage with Presto, and he responded via message last night saying he would investigate the Ercot, but that Fletch was overwhelmed on the Cin and Comed.  He would talk to the NY team and discuss the reasonableness of the deliverables.  He came to the conclusion that they definately need more traders across the board to keep the backs and offpeaks fresh, but they do not have them now.  I will continue to monitor the progress.
