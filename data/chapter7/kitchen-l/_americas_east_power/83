Just to be clear I am expecting Mike to let San Antonio know today that we are out at that price.  We are therefore assuming the AEP deal will for with our PPA still in place.

Zero cost to the Guarantee as it is not recognized as financial.

Tod, Clearly you should puch forward on the AEP sale assuming we keep our PPA.

Per your request, I will start providing a daily status report on the Wind PPA MTM value.  As of the close of Thurs. 9/13, the PPA value was approx. $24.0 MM (after reserves).  When I receive the $100MM guaranty cost I will start incorporating this into a net calculation for an Enron Corp. view of the value.
