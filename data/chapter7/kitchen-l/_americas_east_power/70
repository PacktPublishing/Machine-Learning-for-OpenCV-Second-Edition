Joe,

The following is the language from the DASH which Ben signed..."acceptable to RAC"

?	A $100 million guaranty by Enron Corporate of EPMI's obligations under the PPA has been put in place.  As a condition to closing the financing for the project, the lender (Clarica Life) has required a MAC provision stating that in the event that Enron's credit rating falls below investment grade, Enron is required to provide alternative means, acceptable to RAC, to cover its guaranty obligation.
