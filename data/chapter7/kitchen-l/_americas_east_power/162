Based on the # of EES people attending a meeting that is about tariff prices (ie. EWS , I would hate to see the expense side of the EES ledger.

Kevin -

FYI.  We are tripping over ourselves.  i will probably not go to this meeting if this is how many we take.  Marc Ulrich and Jeff Merola  will do fine as long as they can get their views in.

Janine -

Can you confirm how many people are attending this meeting from our side.  It seems to be getting a little large and I think we need to make sure we are only bringing people that can add significant value to the actual meeting.

My count is as follows:

Marc Ulrich - URM - He is the commercial expert on ComEd and rate effects on our business - Mandatory
Jeff Merola - Manager of Physical Delivery Logistics for Central Region - mandatory
Brad Snyder - Structured supply 
Mark Bernstein - Structured Supply
Jeff Ader - Structured Supply
Janine Migden - Regulatory
Roy Boston - Regulatory
RogersHerndon - EWS Risk
Name I forgot - Legal - Ulrich recomended he go given the ComEd audience

This would be 9.  I think this is too much.  What are your thoughts?  

Given the agenda items of 1) ComEd PPO phase-out intentions, 2) Physical Delivery Issues and 3) Potential Business Transactions b/w ComEd and Enron, I think we need to trim the list of attendees.
