Louise,

- Please let me know if you want me to push for Karen's involvement in the Origination track.


When you have a moment, would appreciate some time to go over some or all of the following:

- EES approach/response
- Update on TexMex
- My various homework assignments (Origination Track, brownbag lunches, new contact mgmt system, etc.)
- Realistic expectation of MidWest earnings in Q4 (I know I'm already hung, but what the heck).
- Some ideas for elephants 
- General catch up

Thanks,

Dave
