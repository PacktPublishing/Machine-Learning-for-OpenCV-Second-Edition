You are correct on the arrow.  No Janet is seeing this for the first time.  I've talked to her regarding we need to have coordination rules and this is our attempt at that issue.

I think the bottom arrow is supposed to be a No - or is that just me misinterpreting the diagram.  Is this something which was just agreed by  you and Janet or how long was it in place beforehand?

Thanks
Louise
