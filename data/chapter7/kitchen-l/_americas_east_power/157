Subject: BNYCP Litigation Analysis:PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL


Attached are the memoranda prepared by outside counsel assessing the BNYCP litigation.  To avoid as much confusion as possible, I suggest reading the Andrews & Kurth memo first, the Bernstein memo second and the risk matrix last.
In a nutshell, all agree that this is a very fact intensive case and that there has been little factual discovery to date.  It is also agreed that we have been denied the benefit of some of the evidence available as a result of the confidentiality obligations in place. Accordingly, much of the analysis provided is really counsel's "best guess" based on the information available. 
That being said, there seems to be a general agreement that, based on the facts currently available and the "quick and dirty" analysis that we have been able to do, the exposure ranges from approximately $20 to $50 million. Interest and attorney fees could also prove significant. 
I am available to discuss this further if you think that would be helpful.  Thanks for your patience.
