Kevin -
 
We need to have some serious converstaions re: this situation.  I am not pleased and will begin to seriously consider other opportunities in Enron if I have to deal with these individuals in the future.

	Guy,

	Your intent for the conference calls was right. We need to have a dialog with these parties like we do with the rest of our structured suppliers. But it must be a coordinated effort. There was no need to cancel the calls. Please coordinate to reestablish the conference calls with these contacts and for any others you may have, please contact  the following people as they are directly responsible for customer coverage and structured supply in their respective regions. We appreciate your efforts and like ComEd and AEP, I am sure we will continue to work closely. 

	East -  Michael Brown x3-1930

	Central - Brad Snyder  x5-8802

	West - Pearce Hammond x3-1438


	thanks,

	Mark

	The Michigan and Cinergy conference calls have both been canceled.  I appreciate all of you that have responded.
