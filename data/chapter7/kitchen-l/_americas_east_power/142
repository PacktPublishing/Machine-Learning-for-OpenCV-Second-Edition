Louise Kitchen would like to receive weekly a list of completed deals and it should include deals done YTD.  Can you provide her with this or let me know who I should contact if you are not the appropriate person?  Also, please send me a copy as well.

Thanks,

Tammie Schoppe
Assistant to Louise Kitchen
