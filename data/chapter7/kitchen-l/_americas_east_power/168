Thanks.  It was painful, but we got through it.

The contract says 5 business days after satisfying the CPs, that would be next Monday.  One problem though, AIG needs 10 business days to notify the investors and receive the funds to complete the sale.  I've got a call into them to see how we solve the inconsistency.

Firstly, congratulations on Alamac.  Not an easy job and you got there in the end.

A quick question, why are we not closing it this week?  Under the contract shouldn't we close on Friday?

Thanks

Louise
