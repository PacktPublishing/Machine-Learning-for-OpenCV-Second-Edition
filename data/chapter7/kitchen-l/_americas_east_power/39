No material current exposure, but we are continuing to review the BNY deal.  The CRO from EME indicated to me that he and the CFO were doing a road show to communicate the current position and direction for the company and said they include Enron.  I am still trying to schedule.

I'll keep you informed.

Given recent events, we are looking to cover our long protection ($15mm) in Edison Mission Energy.  Will keep the position if you are still interested or can sell it to ENA.  Bonds have rallied in, still looking for a market in the Default Swaps.  Pls. let me know if you have any interest.
