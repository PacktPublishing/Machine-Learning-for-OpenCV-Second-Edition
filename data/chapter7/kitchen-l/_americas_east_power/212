Louise,
I just spoke with Faith Killen and she enlightened me on exactly what you're looking for.  It is my understanding that you're not necessarily looking for hotlist information but more of a weekly deal update schedule which would identify deals being worked on and the status of each.  She also indicated that you were looking for this information to come directly from the commercial world and not accounting. 

Dave,
Gary Justice prepares a weekly deal schedule which includes a column for "Status/Follow-Up."  This schedule, if completely populated for each deal, should serve this purpose.  I will pass this information on to him.

Thanks, Paula.

Louise,

Attached is the hotlist based on last week's deals.  It combines both East Power and Generation Investments.  Please let me know if this schedule meets your needs or if you would like to see something different.

Thanks, Paula.
