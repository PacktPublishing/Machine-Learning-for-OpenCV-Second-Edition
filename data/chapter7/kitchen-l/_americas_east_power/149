Louise:

The base model was too large to send via e-mail, so I placed it into the common directory located at o:\_Dropbox\Dodger.  The file name is CASH_BrooklynNavyYard_070601,v4.  If you need help pulling it out of the dropbox, give me a call and I will walk upstairs to bring it up.

I also included the model output from Power Commodity Structuring's analysis of the transaction upsides.  Attached is a draft of the DASH (please note RAC has not officially signed off).  Please let me know if you would like to see anything else.

Thanks-
Bill
