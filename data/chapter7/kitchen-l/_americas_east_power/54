Louise:

I do not have the names from Bob Virgo's area that will be in attendance, but the following should encompass everyone else that I am currently aware of:

	Stuart Zisman	-	Asset Marketing
	Sonya Gasdia	-	RAC
	Rick Bittner	-	RAC
	Bob Frank	-	Regulatory
	Kim Melodick	-	HR
	Ying Liu		-	Finance
	Dan Castagnola -	Finance
	Jeff Blumenthal	-	Tax
	Nancy Corbet	-	Legal
	Rick Whitaker	-	East Power
	Charlie Vetters	-	East Power
	John Lang	-	East Power
	Victor Munoz	-	East Power
	Dave Duran	-	East Power

I imagine a couple of people will go from Virgo's team for a grand total of sixteen.

I understand this group represents a large commitment of time and resources prior to making the business case to you on anything other than a superficial basis.  I am trying to position us so that by the end of next week we should be able to determine if a commercial fatal flaw exists while still keeping us in the game if we like what we see especially given the tight time frame associated with the final bid (end of the first week of November).

If you have any additional questions or concerns, please call me at your earliest convenience.
