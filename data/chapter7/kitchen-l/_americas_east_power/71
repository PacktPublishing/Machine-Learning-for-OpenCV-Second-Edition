David:  Here is a copy of the amendment that we proposed.  The language changes to sections 5.05 and 9.03 were proposed by the lender's counsel.  Please call me with any questions.

Thanks

Subject:	Amendment to IM II PPA

Mike:  Attached is our proposed amendment to the Indian Mesa II PPA.  It deals with the banking clarification (section 4.04 amendments), grid curtailment clarification (section 5.02 amendments), guaranty clarifications requested by the lenders (section 5.05 and 9.03 amendments), and the  ERCOT amendment (section 3.04 amendments) that we have discussed.  Please note that the ERCOT restriction would permit international sales, such as to Mexico, but would otherwise restrict EPMI's sales of energy from the wind facility to other locations within ERCOT.  In the preparation of this draft, we used the same amendment that was previously sent to you by e-mail on 8/22/01.  That e-mail had a redline with it to show the changes to the banking provisions.  Please let us know whether this draft is acceptable or whether you have any questions or comments on the amendment.  Thanks

Regards

John
