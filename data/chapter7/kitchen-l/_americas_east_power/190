Louise, we have discontinued any material work for AIG regarding their acquisition of TM Ventures. We will, however, advise them regarding the liquidation value of the 2 QF projects that they would be acquiring. This will not require any time or effort on our part and is compatible with the overall agreement with AIG. I do believe that the concept of creating a customer for Enron has the potential to create value for us and does not  create any incremental risk. Hope all is going well.
