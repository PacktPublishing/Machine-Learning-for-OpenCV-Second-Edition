Mike,

If you get this while on vacation, I do apologize for interrupting your break.  I have left you a voicemail on the same subject, but thought I would send it to you in writing as well.

Following up on this morning's meeting with Louise and Joe Deffner on the requested ammendments, we went through the list of issues sent by Tod 9/17, and Kevin's subsequent response.

As both Kevin and Louise stated, the first issue, the clarification on banking, is a confirmation of the "intent of the deal".  As you remember, the project's ability to bank RECs and energy, and to carry that bank forward, is the intent of the deal.  We need your recognition that this is the case so that we can go forward with this clarification ammendment.

We hope to keep this moving in your absense and appreciate your cooperation on this point.  Please give me a call, or at a minimum, please share your perspective with Louise on this issue so that we can keep the financing moving forward.

Thank you,
Michael
