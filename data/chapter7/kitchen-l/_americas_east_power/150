Louise,

I just received this confirmation that the (3) auxiliary boilers needed to provide the additional 600 kpph of steam to ConEd at Brooklyn Navy Yard should fit easily on the leased space adjacent to the existing water treatment building for the cogen plant. his is based on auxiliary boiler footprints just received from Babcock & Wilcox, an aux boiler OEM.

The attached layout shows the footprint of the boilers overlayed next to the water treatment building in the parking lot currently under lease by the partnership. It also shows the approximate 25% of space currently being used by others at the opposite end of the parking lot that is assumed not available for additional expansion.

The layout is as accurate as we can make it scaling the drawings available without an actual survey. However, it appears there is plenty of room available to add this equipment.
