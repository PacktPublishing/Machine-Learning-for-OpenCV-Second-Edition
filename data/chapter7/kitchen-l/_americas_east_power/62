Hi Louise,
To refresh your memory, ENA OOC took a loss of ($1.4M) in 2nd quarter for  Doyle equity earnings per Ben Jacoby's request. He is to reimburse you upon the sale of this investment.

I am now told that he will not sell Doyle until October. The 3Q forecasted loss for Doyle is ($662K).  Should I again flash this loss in OOC, or to East Development (Jacoby)? Please advise. Thanks!
