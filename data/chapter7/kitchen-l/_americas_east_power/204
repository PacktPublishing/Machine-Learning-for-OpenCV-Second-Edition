Sorry, I was off the desk and did not read this message earlier.  We did price this put up - it comes out on our offer side in the $6 - $7 range. The best offer we'd make would be $6.  I think Rob gave this number to Rogers earlier this afternoon and hopefully it got to you.

Please could you price that for me at your offer.
