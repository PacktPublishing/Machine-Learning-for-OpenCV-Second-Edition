Louise,
Here are some bullet points for the discussions tomorrow:
-East Power, including Generation Investments made about $50 million in the first half. The greatest contribution came from Ben Jacoby, about $15 million. By the way, I hired Ben along with Scott Healy to acquire sites in 1998.
-All of the traders and structuring, including Bernie Aucoin told me that John Llodra drove both the CMP and NStar deals. Total income $8.5 million.
-I believe Delainey was correct in saying that Ozzie was the brains behind Alamac but Heather did the execution. Total income for the East $7.5 million.
-Most of the rest of the deals were done after I came in.
-Mid market sales have increased.(700% over the first half of 2000)
-This group was in meltdown when I came in(at least on the origination side). I would like to get some credit for stopping the bleeding and starting the rebuilding process in a difficult environment.
