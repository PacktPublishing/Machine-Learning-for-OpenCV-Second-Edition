Louise, I know that you are dealing with more important things now but I wanted to keep you up to speed on TBG and VNG as I continue to move them forward.

Have completed negotiations on TBG.  Plan to forward execution documents on Monday.  Upon TBG's execution I will determine if we want to move forward , delay or terminate the opportunity. I will get with you on this.
I have negotiated a $2 million payment from Sequent to terminate the Asset transaction 1 year early.  Traders believe this is strong value and are willing to transact at that value.  Waiting on formal/written offer from Sequent to complete evaluation.
  
Will keep you posted on these opportunities.
I hope that you are doing alright given the circumstances

Frank
