I am sure no one wants to provide another were strong and stable speech, but we have it on an extremely confidential basis that a memo is being drafted by their risk management group (remember the thorn in Bill's side and mine over the last years...) that recommends a ceasing of additional business with Enron and a review of their remedies under our agreements for significant changes in our financial capacities.  I have no idea how far Dick or Tom may let this go, but it is bad form...
