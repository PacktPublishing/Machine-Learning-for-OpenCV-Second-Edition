Thank you...

FYI... MGU turned an edited contract to us yesterday.  Two operational issues are outstanding, but we do not view either as significant.  We plan to turn executed documents early next week.  They are meeting with the MPSC either November 9th or 12th.  MGU has affirmed (Wednesday) they remain to deem Enron a credit worthy counterparty.  As with everything, we are living moment to moment with them, but I hoped I could provide you something positive.  I am brutally aware the only truly positive will be an executed agreement.  

Laura
