I have traded several phone messages with Bill Transier (EVP, CFO @Ocean).  I expect to get some additional info at that time.  I will keep you posted.  In Bill's last voice mail he suggested that he remained interested in the upsale services activity from ENA even if we were not purchasing the gas.  I will keep you informed.

Only got your message today - is there no way we can rescue it?  What exactly is the problem?  Is our old contract a real problem?
