Focus...

I believe we should get back in front of Keyspan next week, to address or redirect any questions/concerns Keyspan may have to the "general" discussions held to date.  Gil has been in communication with them several times since the meeting, but I believe Chuck needs some constant attention/adoration to move him our direction.  I would love to pop over to NY either before or after our meeting in Chicago.

Thoughts or updates?

Laura
