Louise, As of today there is $722,572 in Schedule C for the TBG settlement.  The material that I provided to you showed $1mm dollars in Schedule C.  The $1mm is actually an estimate that includes payments from TBG for Sept and Oct deliveries that have not yet been received. The amount of those payments that are attributable to Schedule C is $277,428 which will bring Schedule C up to the $1mm at the time of settlement.  I am told that the value should be under "Intra, East-North, or East- Northeast or Scott Neal".  I have been assured that the $ is there.
