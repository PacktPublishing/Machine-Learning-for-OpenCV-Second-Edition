Leaving you this message on your VM as well as email--not sure which will be more accessible.  Finally got through to Scott.  He confirms that it is Enron-specific, and that the decision is coming from Wisconsin Energy's corporate risk management/credit function.  He has been told to stop all trading activity within his purview (financial derivatives); he 'imagines' that both physical and financial are involved, although he does not know for certain.  The company is taking a wait-and-see attitude; there is no set timetable for a resumption.  

I asked for the name of a contact in their corporate risk management group (in order to ask for some more parameters regarding the situation) and was given Donna Brophy at 414-221-2749.  Scott asked me to give him time to call her for a heads-up that she might be hearing from Enron, so I agreed not to call until at least 9am Central.  Is this a call I should make, or is that not appropriate?  Please let me know.  Thanks.

Patrick T.
