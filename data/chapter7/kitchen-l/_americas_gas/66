Louise, that is fine and at the end of the day a decision to be made by Gil and the Weather Group.  Just for the record, I want you to understand that I was very candid with my conversation with Mike and did not sugar coat any of our issues.  I was not trying to lay off a problem into another group.  That being said, I was told that they felt that Gil may have some skills that would be beneficial in their group.  

Frank

Gil will not be going to the Weather Group unless he goes as a Director.

Louise, EGM may be interested in extending a job offer to Gil to work in the weather group.  I had a discussion with Mike McConnell and gave him my general opinion.  I may have oversold.  I will keep you posted.
In addition, Jared Kaiser is returning from EGM and will take over the lead Origination role in the Southeast as we have discussed.
