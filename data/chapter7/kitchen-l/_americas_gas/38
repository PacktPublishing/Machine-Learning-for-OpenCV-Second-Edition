I spoke with Gregg in Chicago.  The transactions that I mentioned to you that were already in the works include 1) $40 MM storage inventory from Prime rate to current curve 2) Pre-pay for $75 to $100 MM for ENA transaction with Peoples Gas (meeting next week) 3) enovate has $20 MM with Citibank (50% Enron/50% Peoples) that we have been trying to get to Enron treasury since March of this year.

If I get the word from you, we potentially could wrap all three of these to front cash to Enron.  I would need to directly make this request to Tom and Bill or we might send a scary signal to them and require significant Enron Corporate Guarantees.

Let me know...

Laura
