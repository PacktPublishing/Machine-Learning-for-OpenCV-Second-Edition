Louise, 
Thanks for contacting me and giving me an opportunity to address your concerns.  Attached is the memo that I referenced regarding Louis DiCarlo.  Please note the date and the last sentence of paragraph one.  To date I have delayed moving Louis because of the MGU deal and I am currently waiting a response from Laura and Russell to discuss same.  I will follow up with you after my meeting with the larger group this afternoon to discuss next steps.
Ed

Due to the needs of the EES business, Louis has agreed to change his role and get involved in structuring retail deals.  Unfortunately, that means that he will have to relocate to 14 until we get to the new building.  His combination of ENA wholesale experience and his prior PG&E retail experience make him a very valuable asset for that effort.  Louis will retain responsibility for the MGU transaction until a logical hand-off point, which may be as late as the date MGU is closed and booked.

Kelli Little will assume the role of leading ENA (wholesale) Central Region gas structuring.  Kelli's has certainly earned this opportunity and I am confident that she will add value to the Central Region's effort.

Please join me in congratulating Louis and Kelli in their new roles.
