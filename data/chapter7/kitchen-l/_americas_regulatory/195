Agreement in principle.  Still need to negotiate definitive contracts.  Man=
y parties still have to agree with this proposed solution before its final =
(including the Legislature).  This looks very good for SCE.

Subject:=09Summary of the MOU

The following is an outline of the basic terms of the Southern California E=
dison Memorandum of Understanding:

?=09Commitment to Provide Power - SCE will keep its current generation plan=
ts and other generation assets and commit them to provide power on a regula=
ted cost-of-service basis for 10 years.
?=09Dedication of Power - Edison International will commit the entire outpu=
t of Sunrise (one of Edison International's non-regulated generating facili=
ties) to the State on a fixed price basis for 10 years. Phase I of Sunrise =
is to be brought online by August 15, 2001. If not brought online by August=
 15, 2001, Edison International shall be assessed a $2 million penalty.
?=09Transmission Sale - SCE will sell to the State its transmission assets =
for approximately $2.76 billion (2.3 times the net book value of the assets=
), subject to certain adjustments. Of the $2.76 billion, the $1.5 billion g=
ain on sale, will be used to reduce SCE's net undercollected amount as of J=
anuary 31, 2001. In connection with the purchase, the State will also assum=
e certain liabilities associated with the transmission assets.
?=09Backup Transaction - If the transmission sale does not occur within two=
 years for reasons beyond the parties' control, then if the State elects, S=
CE shall sell to the State SCE's hydro generation assets. If the hydro asse=
ts are not worth $1.5 billion, then SCE will also sell the state after Dece=
mber 31, 2010 enough below-market-price-power to make up the shortfall.
?=09Conservation Property - SCE shall grant perpetual conservation easement=
s to the State covering approximately 260,000 acres of its Big Creek hydroe=
lectric related lands and 825 acres of its Eastern Sierra hydroelectric rel=
ated lands.  Some of the land may be deeded in fee.
?=09Contribution by Edison International - Edison International will refund=
 to SCE not less than $400 million.  This money will consist of a refund of=
 approximately $293 million in estimated 2000 quarterly tax payments plus a=
pproximately $197 million in federal loss carryback tax savings.
?=09Investment - Edison International and SCE will invest not less than $3 =
billion over the next 5 years in capital improvements for SCE.
?=09Litigation - SCE shall dismiss certain claims, including its takings an=
d filed rate doctrine cases.
?=09CPUC Regulation - CPUC shall continue to regulate SCE using historical =
principles of ratemaking.
?=09Payment for Portion of QF Drop-off - SCE shall pay an amount that repre=
sents that portion of the net short from January 18, 2001 to April 1, 2001 =
that is attributable to QF's not selling to SCE (due to SCE's failure to pa=
y the QF's).  SCE will securitize this amount.
?=09Securitization - SCE shall securitize its full net undercollected amoun=
t (approx. $3.5 billion).  The securitization shall occur in two tranches (=
i.e. two different nonbypassable dedicated rate components).

?=09The first tranche will occur after the passage of legislation and the s=
igning of the definitive agreements and will cover the net undercollected a=
mount, less the gain on sale, plus interest on certain obligations in the n=
et undercollected amount.
?=09The second tranche would be triggered if the transmission sale does not=
 occur within two years.  Accordingly, the second tranche would not show up=
 in rates for two years, if at all.

?=09Buying the Net Short - The State will be required to buy the net short =
through December 31, 2002.  After 2002 SCE will be responsible for covering=
 the net short.
?=09Investment Recovery - SCE shall have an authorized rate of return that =
will not drop below its current rte (11.6%) during the 10 year cost of serv=
ice ratemaking period.
?=09Next Steps (Definitive Agreements and CPUC Action):

?=09Definitive Agreements - Once the MOU is signed, the next stage is to ne=
gotiate definitive agreements which contain the specific terms of the trans=
mission sale, as well as the specific terms of the various other related ag=
reements (e.g., the O&M Agreement, Transmission Services Agreement and the =
Facilities Services Agreement).
?=09CPUC Action - Prior to entering into the definitive agreements, the CPU=
C must undertake certain actions (which include: establishing mechanisms fo=
r preapproval of procurement costs and URG costs, deferring SCE's general r=
ate case until 2003, granting SCE some relief from direct access credits an=
d clarifying the first priority condition in the holding company act).
