El Paso Line #1103

?	The El Paso restart approval has switched from the OPS to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).  The NTSB is currently investigating the explosion to determine a cause to the blast.

?	Once cause is established, the project will then shift back to the OPS, when they will begin to analyze the data from tests that El Paso is currently running.  At this point, OPS may request El Paso to either rerun certain tests or perform further repairs.

?	The individual at OPS (in charge of El Paso's South Mainline) indicated that all 3 lines were being investigated and tested.  OPS will begin to analyze the test data one line at a time (ex.  line 1103 will be completely tested, analyzed, and cleared for use before following the same steps for lines 1100 and 1110).  The source indicated that as these lines are being tested/repaired the current pressure on the system will not increase but instead be maintained.

?	We are currently developing sources at the NTSB for the following information:
-	Cause of action (#1103)
-	Timeframe to determine cause of action
