Below is the transcript of an interview conducted yesterday with State Trea=
surer Phil Angelides:

Summary:
?=09Bond Issuance to be $10B with 10-15 year term, 70% tax exempt and 30% n=
on-exempt
?=09Angelides in favor of wind fall profit tax
?=09Opposed to current discussion between Davis and Socal in regards to Soc=
al paying off the generators over 12 years with a 2-year grace period

What decisions on rate components are necessary before you can sell bonds?
"The big things we need are that the PUC must enter into agreement with DWR=
, essentially warranting that sufficient revenues from rates will be availa=
ble for purchasing power. It is really their job to define what each party =
needs to pay for power. We need to give assurance to the investment communi=
ty that whatever the overall rate is, the state will get enough to pay its =
bonds. However, if the utilities challenge the decision, it could stall the=
 bond issuance."
What do you think will be the size of the first bond issue?
"Based on what is currently possible and what the legislature has authorize=
d, around $10bn. The PUC has allowed us to sell north of  $13bn, but we ant=
icipate that $10bn is absorbable. Until the administration provides details=
 for this office and the public on what its costs of buying power are and w=
hat it needs in terms of funding, what will drive it is that number, not wh=
at the PUC has said. The issuance may well be a single $10bn issue or a ser=
ies of smaller ones done together, e.g. $3bn each 3 weeks apart."
What is the total size of the market for CA tax-exempt bonds?
"What we do normally is $5-10bn in bonds for various revenues or general ob=
ligations. In 1997 the CA infrastructure rate reductions bonds was a $7bn i=
ssuance, and this was handled well.  This is not exclusively a CA market.  =
Around $200bn of these bonds is sold each year.   We anticipate that the bo=
nds will be 70% tax-exempt and 30% non-exempt."
What is the total of electric supply contracts that are firm enough to requ=
ire funding?
"We have estimates. The DWR is buying power, and let's say power costs $100=
 and its portion of rates is $70. This bond issuance covers the diff betwee=
n $100 and $70. So, the bond issuance is a way to cover the gap. However, i=
f power prices do not come down, you cannot keep borrowing.  If we issue mo=
re than $10bn in bonds, I have to see the whole financial plan.  (The impli=
cation is that he will not keep this plan secret.)"
What will be the term mix of the bond issues?
"Overall term is expected to be in the 10-15 year range.  I do not know the=
 mix."
Do you have the ability to do bridging tax anticipation notes or anything l=
ike that to take care of the general fund?
"The very purpose of the bridge loan is that we are taking a taxable and ta=
x-exempt bridge loan until bonds are issued.  In order for us to issue bond=
s, a number of steps have to occur. I would hope that the PUC and DWR do wh=
at they have to do realistically by June.  Then the bond issuance would com=
e semi all-at-once.  (In other words, either all at once, or something like=
 $3 billion every three weeks.)"
Are all of the general funds' assets in cash, or are some in the form of a =
less liquid receivable?
"We have a lot of liquidity in real cash in general fund.  We have a cash f=
low. We have the ability in pooled money investment accounts so that we can=
 go out to five years. We have $40bn-plus in that account."
What is the minimum working capital required in the general fund for day-to=
-day operations?
"It depends, and goes up and down.  On any given day we are doing on the or=
der of $500mm. There is a $100bn budget between the general funds and speci=
al fund."
Are you discussing the DWR contracting in relation to the required funding?=
 Do you have a veto on the deals struck?
"This is all in the administration's court.  What we have asked for is the =
information.  We have asked for this today by letter.  We have to move from=
 working with 3 or 4 banks to a public offering, which means public disclos=
ure.  The general fund has been making advances to buy power, but we want t=
o get out of that business and to stop the $4bn plus drain on general fund =
from arranging an interim loan."
What is the credit risk from industry or other large users cherry picking o=
r self-selecting?
"There are limits on the options out there.  AB1X has limited the ability o=
f people to opt out of the system.  If you do allow them to opt out, what d=
o they have to pay to preserve the revenue stream? The agreement between th=
e DWR and the PUC will say that, through a financing order, we will get you=
 the revenue to service the bonds, even if it adjusts rates.  This will be =
a covenant that the money will be made available."
If an initiative is launched could it create enough uncertainty to have an =
effect on ABIX or the bond issuance? What about "Harvey proofing"?  What is=
 the direct state participation?
"The state's role is infrastructure and economic development.  Bonds will b=
e issued in name of DWR only to pay for power the state is buying, not to r=
epay utility deb.  I don't think the state will repay utility debt.  The st=
ate can buy power in or out of Chapter 11.  There will be no participation =
by the state bank.  I know Harvey well, and he and I agree on a number of t=
hings.  For example, I am cosponsoring the public power authority. We shoul=
d not put the state in the business of refinancing utility debt.  I don't t=
hink most consumer groups realize that we are selling bonds to pay for powe=
r.  I very much want, and it is in my interest, to repay the general fund. =
 At the same time that this office is financing the purchase of energy, the=
 fundamental problem is the price we are being charged by the generators-th=
e ransom that is being demanded by the generators. I agree with Harvey that=
 as of this current time the generators are winning.  We will have to consi=
der excess profits taxes, or if the generators continue, they have increase=
d their prices tenfold.  The generators they bought a set of plants for $3.=
1bn.  Since January the state has spent over $4bn.  If the generators don't=
 take their foot off our throat, they may leave us no option but to take ba=
ck plants under emergency power.   So let them justify those rates.  What c=
auses the problem is the generators jacking up prices to the point where th=
ey will make us do something about it."
What is the "measurable size premium" that will have to be paid based on th=
e most current estimates of bond issue size?
"Measurable is the wrong choice of words.  We don't know how many basis poi=
nts. If it is more than $10bn, we will begin to feel it.=20
Also, I am not for that proposal to allow the utilities to pay off the gene=
rators over 12 years with a 2-year grace period. They should work that out =
themselves, not on the backs of ratepayers.  The perspective here is that t=
hey did very, very well in 1996, 97 and 98.  They upstreamed billions."
