Executive Summary:
?=09California Claims Victory Over Easing Power Prices =20
?=09California's Budget doesn't Look Good for a Vote on Friday

Power Prices
Sources report that generator's acknowledge that the drop in power prices i=
n California last week was due at least in part to the threat of price cont=
rols.  Generators and traders are reportedly increasingly unwilling to line=
 up power inventory over the next few months, which sources believe is like=
ly to lead to increased volatility.  While Governor Davis issued statements=
 attributing easing power prices to his negotiating long-term contracts and=
 made no note of increased hydrogenation in the northwest and lighter deman=
d from cool weather in California.=20

California Budget has Friday Deadline
Sources indicate that the California legislature missing the June 15th budg=
et deadline, which appears likely, may affect California's ability to secur=
e future financing.  Coupled with poor macroeconomic indicators (such as in=
creasing unemployment), the outlook for the state does not look good.  Sour=
ces report that the budget would have to go to print today in order for it =
to be printed for a vote on Friday.  While not going to print today does no=
t mean that there will not be a vote Friday, sources are pessimistic that t=
he legislature will agree on a budget by Friday. The Republicans are report=
edly concerned that the 12.5 B in revenue bonds will not sell when they are=
 issued.  The Republicans are asking for a $3-$5 B budget reserve as insura=
nce against this possibility.  They want to achieve this by cutting the inc=
reases to programs (such as education, which was increased more than was ma=
ndated by law) while leaving base program amounts alone.  However, to date =
there has been failure to reach agreement among members over which programs=
 to cut.
