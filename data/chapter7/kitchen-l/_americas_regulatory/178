Bridge Loan Financing Bills May Not Meet Their May 8th Deadline Due to Lack=
 of Support
Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the=
 bond issuance/bridge loan by the May 8th deadline.   Any possibility for a=
 deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republic=
ans and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic cauc=
us is reportedly "unwilling to fight" for Davis.  Many legislative Republic=
ans and Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, o=
nce the bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would "double=
 dip" into the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the leg=
islature and the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses th=
e details of the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take plac=
e.  Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the lon=
g-term power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require t=
hat the bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in =
breach of contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass th=
e bridge loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st wi=
ll be very difficult.

The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the stat=
e would "eat" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General=
 Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately =
$8 billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this =
concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for ful=
l disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the =
details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they=
 will support the bond issuance to go forward.

Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB =
31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bi=
ll passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lac=
k of Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs fo=
r community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be am=
ended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, curre=
ntly in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should get =
paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be li=
kely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy).=20
=20
According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, Republic=
ans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in =
the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated that only 1/2 =
of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  Other Republ=
icans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The Republicans intend=
 to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, Lehman Brothers repo=
rtedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some ind=
ications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.

Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time
The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create t=
he California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion=
 authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be aut=
horized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the addi=
tional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power =
going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these authoriz=
ations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the governor =
has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond amount is =
that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support.   No f=
urther action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 6X until it =
is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  for purchas=
ing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  the Calif=
ornia Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  be consi=
dered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this idea  earl=
ier in the crisis.

SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy
At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  T=
he first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the =
governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is Au=
gust 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According t=
o sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has s=
igned it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davi=
s and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicat=
es that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary bank=
ruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash. =20

The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond is=
suance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) s=
tating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, th=
en the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the st=
ate will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and p=
assed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for=
 bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and=
 the DWR proportionately from rate payments.
