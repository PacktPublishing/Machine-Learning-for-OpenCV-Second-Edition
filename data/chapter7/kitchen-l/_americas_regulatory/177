Executive Summary

?=09The likely outcome of the 16 May elections is a victory by the BC Liber=
al Party (currently holding polls at 70%), a pro-business, right-of-center =
party led by Gordon Campbell. =20
?=09Major changes in British Columbia energy policy are likely under a Libe=
ral government.
?=09A low snow pack, a return to regulation by the BC Utilities Commission =
and public concern about outstanding debts owed by US power consumers could=
 force BC Hydro to stop out-of-province power sales once existing contracts=
 expire
?=09BC Hydro's additional generation at Williston is likely undeliverable

Liberal Party Platform

?=09Income tax cut that would make BC's income tax the lowest in Canada
?=09Independent audit of the province's books amid allegations of NDP misma=
nagement and incompetence
?=09Review of all Crown corporations (including BC Hydro) to enhance effici=
ency and management quality
?=09Campbell has also said that he wants to scrap the Corporate Capital Tax=
, the Machinery Equipment Tax and the Corporate Income Tax.

Energy Agenda

According to sources, under the Liberal party's rule, significant changes i=
n the BC government's energy policy could include a move toward the privati=
zation of some BC Hydro assets, perhaps including its transmission assets, =
as well as increased government support for independent power producers and=
 coal-fired production.  At the same time, a rate review and attempts to es=
tablish a broad electricity strategy for the province could lead to a lack =
of clarity about the province's overall energy strategy over the next few y=
ears.  Campbell reportedly is a proponent of deregulation and of expanding =
coal-fired production.  Campbell calls thermal coal, "an asset that we want=
 to be able to move forward with and to encourage once again in BC."  A hig=
h-ranking NDP source believes that Campbell will take the province back alo=
ng the path of natural resources extraction rather than promoting new techn=
ology.  The source expects this to lead to strong protests from environment=
alists.  "These are confrontational moves, and people will be on the street=
s."=20

Campbell's most likely choice for energy minister is Richard Neufeldt, thou=
gh we caution that this decision depends on the make-up of the legislature =
after the election.  Neufeldt is responsible for the Liberal Party's energy=
, mining and northern development portfolio.  Sources speculate that if rig=
ht-wing Liberals are dissatisfied with the party's performance after the Ma=
y election, Neufeldt could again defect to the Opposition.  However, this g=
ives Campbell even greater incentive to name Neufeldt energy minister, a hi=
gh-profile position.

Should the Liberals win the election, Gordon Campbell has indicated that he=
 would return BC Hydro to regulation by the BC Utilities Commission.  The B=
C government has derived $5.5 billion in revenue from BC Hydro since 1991 (=
roughly 85 percent of its profit).  Critics say this has undermined the uti=
lity's ability to pay down approximately $7.5 billion in debt and invest in=
 the future. This also has left Hydro without a rate stabilization fund, so=
mething that sources feel may be needed this year.  Campbell reportedly int=
ends to address these issues, and one can expect this to lead to calls for =
change.
=20
Electricity Export Policy

Currently the BC Utilities Commission is demanding more information about B=
C Hydro's out-of-province sales.  The Commission has warned that, given the=
 low snow pack, the utility could be a net importer of power this year. Sup=
porting this view, the Northwest Power Planning Council, representing BC Hy=
dro's key trading partners in the US, has said that it would not be able to=
 rely upon British Columbia or Alberta during peak consumption periods over=
 the next few years, and that its customers face a 25 percent chance of not=
 making it through the winter without power losses.  The combination of a l=
ow snow pack, a return to regulation by the BC Utilities Commission and pub=
lic concern about outstanding debts owed to BC Hydro by US consumers may fo=
rce BC Hydro to stop out-of-province power sales once existing contracts ex=
pire.

BC Hydro Privatization

A key campaign energy issue for the Liberal party is the privatization of B=
C Hydro.  Campbell has urged greater electricity competition, saying, "We n=
eed to ensure the transmission infrastructure is available to all, producer=
s and consumers, on an equal and non-discriminatory basis." He stated that =
independent power producers have been discouraged at every turn. "I want to=
 change that big time," he told the Canadian Institute of Energy.  Campbell=
 also urged more natural gas development, including pipelines and co-genera=
tion plants.

Campbell backtracked on this stance last week after being challenged by NDP=
 leader Ujjal Dosanjh.  Campbell stated on 25 April, "We have no intention =
of selling BC Hydro; we have no intentions of selling their transmission li=
nes, no intention of selling their dams, we have no intention of selling th=
eir reservoirs."  Liberal Party spokesman Mike Morton also reiterated on 29=
 April that BC Hydro would not be for sale.  A high-level NDP source commen=
ted that Campbell has been extremely careful in his choice of words regardi=
ng BC Hydro, essentially saying that he would not privatize the dams, trans=
mission lines or generating stations, but that he is in favor of opening th=
e sector up to competition.

However, local sources believe that some parts of BC Hydro might be sold as=
 part of an overall review of BC Crown Corporations to enhance efficiency. =
 Likely sale prospects include BC Hydro's distribution channels and its ene=
rgy trading subsidiary, Powerex.  In addition, Gary Farrell-Collins, the Li=
beral finance spokesperson and possible second choice for energy minister (=
after Neufeldt), has stated that public ownership of BC Hydro's non-core bu=
sinesses, such as Westech, its systems division, and customer billing, coul=
d come under review.

BC Hydro Williston Generation

Current reservoirs levels at BC Hydro's Williston hydro-generation facility=
 are at 2,150ft, which allows BC Hydro to drop levels another 35 ft (170 Gw=
hs/ft) under their current permit.  The one drawback to this plan's additio=
nal generation involves the Mackenzie pulp mill that would have to cease op=
eration if water levels were to fall below 2,140ft.  Sources close to the M=
inister of Mines & Energy - elect, Richard Neufeldt, indicate that levels a=
t Williston probably will not be drawn down below Mackenzie's operational l=
imits due to concern over political backlash.=20
