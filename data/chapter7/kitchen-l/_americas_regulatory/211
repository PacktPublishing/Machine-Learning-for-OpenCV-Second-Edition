Briefly:

The hearing that was planned to focus on UC issues has been postponed, although per the attached there will be a discussion concerning the impact of Energy Service Providers turning their customers back to DWR/utility service.


Also, the Federal Judge has scheduled the UC/CSU - Enron Energy Services hearing for April 11th.  UC had requested an immediate review versus a procedural 35 days to schedule.  The schedule reflects a more procedural answer.  

More as we get information.

Subject:	Thursday Hearing

Per Sandy, it sounds like there is going to be a budget committee hearing on Thursday to discuss DWR procurement and the effect of marketers returning customers to utility service.  It looks like we may be asked to provide testimony (but not about any customer specific issues).  Mike Day would be the right person to provide that testimony if needed.  I'll pass on any more details as I get them.  MDS
