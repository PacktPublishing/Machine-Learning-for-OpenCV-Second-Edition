Executive Summary
?=09Davis struggles to find Senate support for SoCal transmission deal
?=09Only chance of deal going through is a one-time quick vote; if deal has=
 to go to hearings - it will probably die
?=09If not transmission deal, legislators will seize assets and seek price =
caps
?=09Asset seizure would target power contracts, then power plants; as a res=
ult the endless court battles will ensue, but this gives Davis opportunity =
to continue to blame generators and marketers
?=09Bankruptcy for SoCal is still the most likely scenario, with the QFs or=
 SoCal itself likely to file if the transmission deal dies or gets amended
?=09Congressional democrats rally around Davis and seize opportunity to bla=
me the Administration
=09
Transmission Deal and Democratic Support
As Governor Gray Davis scrambles to build support for his SoCal Ed. transmi=
ssion proposal, one thing is evident; the longer the deal is exposed to pub=
lic debate, the less likely it is to pass.  In fact, politicians have been =
so leery of the deal that Davis has been unable to locate even one sponsor =
to introduce the bill in the Senate.  In the eyes of many Democratic legisl=
ators (and all Republicans) forcing SoCal Edison into bankruptcy is looking=
 like a better option than buying the transmission lines; that is why the G=
overnor's senior strategists have quietly been trying to schedule a quick "=
up or down" vote on the transmission line purchase as early as next week.  =
The bill is currently not scheduled to be voted on in effort to avoid debat=
e, however, if there is an opening within the next two weeks and Davis feel=
s he has enough support, it will be pushed through.  Because the SoCal deal=
 needs every piece in place as "negotiated" by Davis' team, the team wants =
no amendments allowed on the Assembly floor and a quick vote.  If this unli=
kely fast track strategy fails for Davis, the prospects for the transmissio=
n lines purchase will deteriorate steadily (keep in mind that that it canno=
t even be resubmitted to the Assembly until it has been vetted by SoCal Edi=
son attorneys).  According to sources, the legislature is going to try to m=
odify the Memorandum of Understanding between Gov. Davis and SCE.  However,=
 the Senate leadership does not believe there will be sufficient support to=
 pass even a modified MOU. Burton reportedly believes that at least 6 Democ=
rats will vote against it along with the Republicans.  The more that bill g=
ets picked apart in public, the uglier it looks and the more Democrats will=
 realize that they are all alone in supporting it.=20
=20
Another problem faced by the legislatures is the deal is in favor of SoCal =
and not the state.  Among other things, the state is overpaying by about $1=
.5 billion for the transmission lines.  Additionally, the MOU Davis has wit=
h SoCal. Ed nearly matches, point for point, the deal Davis condemned with =
PG&E.

Asset Seizures
Since before the PG&E bankruptcy filing, we have maintained that asset seiz=
ures through eminent domain would become a major pursuit for increasingly f=
rustrated Democrats.  Davis' legal office has thoroughly scrubbed the law o=
n eminent domain seizures of everything from power generating assets across=
 California to existing power contracts negotiated by, whom Davis's calls, =
"profiteering power brokers".  Of course, everyone in the Governor's office=
 understands that any seizing would immediately end up in state and federal=
 courts, and would be a legal nightmare (there are a few minor Constitution=
al, legal and interstate commerce problems). The main thing is that the sei=
zing would continue Davis's main approach to this problem -- management by =
press conference -- and it would put the Governor and Democrats on the righ=
t side of the issue -- punishing the capitalist leeches.  According to one =
senior Democratic legislator, there is movement within Democratic members o=
f the state Assembly to demand that Davis agree to seize the power contract=
s in return for their vote in favor of the power transmission purchase. Of =
course, taking the contracts would only be setting a precedent for taking t=
he power plants.  The appeal of seizing the contracts is that it would alle=
gedly put California state officials in charge of where the power is sold a=
nd reduce mark-ups substantially as they used the contract power authority =
to provide spot-market power purchases before peak emergency conditions dri=
ve the price through the roof.=20

Price Caps
One strong indication as to whether or not summer price caps will occur dep=
ends powerfully on decisions made by the three Republican Governors from Co=
lorado, Alaska and Wyoming. These three were the key players during the Por=
tland Western Governor's Conference last January and, according to senior W=
hite House officials, it took the personal and prolonged intervention of Pr=
esident Bush himself to peel these three away from an otherwise unanimous c=
all for price caps from the governors. "If they had signed that price cap a=
ppeal," the administration source said, "we would already have price caps. =
So if they start to make it clear something has changed, we will have to li=
sten."  Sources indicate that if these Republican leaders begin to rethink =
their opposition to price caps, the Bush administration will be forced to r=
econsider price caps as a remedy for the West.=20

Cost Plus Caps -- Think of these as Republican price caps in that their fir=
st duty is to make sure private companies make money and have incentives to=
 provide power into the affected grid. Just to give some idea of magnitudes=
 in a cost plus deal, current discussions would put a cap on power costs at=
 something like $250 per kilowatt hour. That is a long way down from the Au=
gust futures contract that is pricing in $750 per kilowatt hour, but a long=
 way above last August's $150/kwhr price and a particularly long way above =
the cost of generating this power, which is something like $25-30/kwh.=20

Market-Price Exceptions -- The option allows the Bush administration to hav=
e political credit for imposing price caps. As we write, FERC is currently =
,in the process of considering permit renewals for five companies generatin=
g power in California (Duke, Dynegy, AES, Reliant and Williams).  The permi=
t grants a further three-year waiver that allows them to sell power into Ca=
lifornia in the existing "whatever price the market will bear".  In other w=
ords, FERC could simply not grant these companies the right to sell energy =
at the market price, perhaps by changing a definition of controlling market=
 share, and then power to control prices would revert back to FERC.=20

Technically, in granting the extension of these permits, FERC has to establ=
ish a formal finding that the five power companies do not wield "market pow=
er" -- that means they cannot affect the price of energy by withholding pow=
er at crucial times. Of course, FERC has just found on three different ruli=
ngs in the last four months that the companies wield exactly that kind of a=
bility over market prices and has ordered minor rebates to adjust for the s=
ubsequent price spikes. But that would mean FERC would have to want to wiel=
d effective power over price capping in California and they have shown no d=
esire on that front. The escape clause for FERC simply to renew the waivers=
 is that they are routinely renewed unless the company applying for waivers=
 controls more than 20% of an electricity market and none of these companie=
s come close.

In other words, the waivers option lets FERC escape if the Bush administrat=
ion and FERC commissioners really want to escape. Once again, that decision=
 may be more in the hands of the three Republican Governors than anywhere e=
lse in the country. But you can be certain that in the past few days Admini=
stration officials have become fully aware of the potential political liabi=
lities of doing nothing except advocating more nuclear and coal power plant=
s.=20

Democrats Seize Opportunity to blame Bush
Senior political leaders now think the total energy bill for the year could=
 come in as high as $60 billion, which would destroy state finances for a d=
ecade.  Add to that the constant drumbeat of numbers that voters hear every=
day about their own direct out-of-pocket electricity costs (they paid $7 bi=
llion for electricity in 1999, $27 billion in 2000 and are expected to pay =
$70 billion this year -- ten times the rate two years ago. Then, of course,=
 they open bills with massive rate increases that bring all those incredibl=
e numbers home in a very direct way, and, well, who can blame the Democrats=
 for saying there is a simple solution, but the White House won't allow it.

National level Democrats realize California's power crisis is a prime oppor=
tunity to chastise the Bush administration and its free-market advocate, FE=
RC Chairman Hebert, over their resistance to summer price caps.  As Califor=
nia's leaders calculate this year's taxpayer energy bill at potentially $60=
 billion, a rogue's gallery of Democratic congressional leaders are current=
ly meeting with Governor Davis and coordinating efforts to fan out across t=
he eight western states of the power grid with a singular message: "the sol=
ution to all western voters electricity problems lies right in Washington D=
C, at FERC headquarters controlled by Bush Administration appointees."  And=
 as the political dialogue takes on a more aggressive national tone and its=
 possible impact on control over the US Congress comes more into focus, the=
 solutions articulated by California's Democrats who sense they have Republ=
icans on the run in the West become less and less "free market" focused.  T=
he two strains of the Democratic solution that are becoming an unavoidable =
part of the energy picture are asset seizures and price caps. =20
