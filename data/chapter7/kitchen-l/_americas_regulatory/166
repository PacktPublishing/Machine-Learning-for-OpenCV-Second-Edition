Below is a brief summary of the BC election results and some analysis into the new political party's' implication.  As the new BC energy strategy further develops, we will provide a more detailed follow-up reports.  

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
?	New Democratic Party sweeps election
?	Opposition within newly elected party possible
?	Campbell to consider dividing BC Energy and Mines portfolio

NDP Election
As expected, the NDP was "wiped out" by the Liberal Party.  At this point, the Liberals have secured 74 of 79 "ridings" (a "riding" is the BC terminology for an open seat), while the NDP has won only three.  Counting has not yet been completed in another riding, though it is expected to go to the Liberals, as well.  The final riding, in Victoria, is disputed due to approximately 700 absentee ballots.  The NDP is currently trailing the Liberals by 50 votes.  This dispute is not expected to be resolved until 29 May, when all absentee ballots will be counted.  No other parties secured seats, though sources report that the Greens acted as a "spoiler" for the NDP in several cases.

Opposition Party
Sources speculate that it is possible that, due to the poor showing by the NDP, a new Opposition might form within the ranks of the Liberals.  Approximately five former members of the Social Credit Party (which was disbanded in the early 1990s) were elected to Liberal seats.  Sources state that it is possible that these members could re-form the Social Credit Party within the legislature to act as an Opposition to the Liberal government.  Sources also state that Richard Neufeld, as a former Reform Party member, might choose to join this Opposition if it forms, though there is no read at this time as to how likely this is to occur.  Otherwise, due to the landslide, Campbell's Liberal government is expected to have a "carte blanche" to do whatever it wants.

Minister of Energy & Mines
Campbell is expected to focus on forming his cabinet first.  There reportedly is a considerable pay gap between the cabinet and the "backbenchers" (MLAs), meaning that there is likely to be "considerable jockeying" for positions.  However, there are 6-10 obvious contenders, including Richard Neufeld, who is likely to be named energy minister.  Sources report that Campbell intends to reduce the size of the cabinet somewhat, though the size of the reduction is not known at this time.  However, he reportedly may be planning to split the energy and mines portfolio off from northern development, forming two separate positions.  It is also possible that energy and mines could be combined with other positions to form a larger natural resources portfolio.
