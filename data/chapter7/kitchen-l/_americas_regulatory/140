Louise,

A detailed discussion of all of the assets currently under management by EC=
R is being prepared by Jesus Melendrez and is near completion. I am meeting=
 with Pam Becton in the morning to review the various off balance sheet veh=
icles.  The assets that are in active divestiture process are CGAS and Juni=
per.  An agent has been engaged for the Juniper assets.  We are in discussi=
on with a group on CGAS.  We expect both of these transactions to close by =
year end but hopefully in the 3rd quarter.  The Preston I & II VPPs were sy=
ndicated into Brazos in December '00 and January '01, respectively.  The Cr=
escendo ($7.5 MM) VPP was syndicated into Brazos in December '00.  The rema=
inder of the Crescendo VPPs should be moved into Brazos by year end or 1Q'0=
2 once a second VPP transaction occurs.  The KCS VPP ($159 MM) is set to cl=
ose and fund no later than 6/27 according to Tim Proffitt. Hanson is an acc=
rual and may be sold by year end if no other drilling occurs. Ameritex, Cyp=
ress, Sam Gary/Bonne Terre, Vastar, Texland are assets that are still in de=
velopment. Crescendo, Westwin, Nutech and Preston Equity are recent transac=
tions (< 1yr old).  Several options are being reviewed on Mariner - (i) sal=
e or merger with another company, (ii) IPO, provided Enron gets its debt re=
paid and 75% of its equity sold at an enterprise valuation of $500 MM or gr=
eater (the MEGS pipeline asset would be included in this option), or (iii) =
continue to develop the asset.  We will make our recommendation on Mariner =
once Allan Keel completes his analysis.

I recognize that this explanation is brief.  Let me know if you need additi=
onal information or would like to meet to discuss further. =20
