Hi Louise,

With the copy of the procedures that I gave you I think we have covered who can suspend George. However I am still trying to figure out who is responsible for determining when to shut it down. I was wondering if you know whether Greg Whalley is still going to be responsible for managing the product or has it been turned over to the crude group.

Also were you serious when you said you wanted the suspend trading button back. Thanks.
