Thanks for taking time this morning to go over some goals for EnronOnline.  As far as I'm concerned, the platform we have is astonishing, and I agree that the more we lengthen our lead over the competition (in both trading and technology) the better our chances of landing some private marketplace sales.  To that end, Jay and I will begin hounding the trading heads and rounding up development needs and potential enhancements to boost trade volume and revenue.  Also, we'll get Kal focused on periodic face-lifts of the GUI.  Then we will devote Origination attention to third party sales which will validate our contention that the platform has value outside of its considerable worth to Enron.  If resources become constrained, it will simply mean that we are finding traction in the right places.

Yes, I am excited about this job, and yes, I want to be in the hot seat you and Greg are describing.  I hope I can run ideas past you from time to time and I trust you will let me know when you have comments or concerns.

Thanks,
Brad
