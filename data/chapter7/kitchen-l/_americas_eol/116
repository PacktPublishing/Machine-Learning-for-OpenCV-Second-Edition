Hi Louise, John,
 
Attached are the two requested updates on East Power and East Power Financial deal counts for Oct 19th. Savita sent the requested PowerPoint slides and they should also be in your mailboxes. Just let me know if you have any questions, or need any additional information.
 
Thanks,
