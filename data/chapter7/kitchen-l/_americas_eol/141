Rick - Linda is tied up with Rick and Mark.  She asked that John and I get with you today so we can get final approval for the transparency language.  Leon with the Committee called us this morning seeking our thoughts.  Give us a ring when you have a chance and then we can follow up with Loiuse.

Thanks - Chris
 


Attached reflects our efforts to further tighten the language on transparency.
