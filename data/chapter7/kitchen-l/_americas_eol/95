Hi Mark, Barbara,

Can we work something out with AEP whereby we don't change the online GTC for sometime? We do have language in the Product Long Description that adresses the sale of HPL. Is there any other way we can allay AEP's concern that counterparties logging onto EnronOnline are confused about the actual ownership of HPL. Thanks.

Savita
