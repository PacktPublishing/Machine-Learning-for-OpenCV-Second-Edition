Louise,

Just wanted to let you know that the account for C. Fradas has been created and the pages have been customized for US Gas and Power.  Furthermore, I have tried to reach Christopher twice but have not been able to do so. I have left him a voice mail with his ID and Password. Also, we are monitoring his ID to see if he logs in.

Let me know if you have any questions,
