Louise,

I took a meeting with this guy from Bloomberg at Whalley's request.  Attached is Bloomberg's idea to set up a power trading company/platform in Europe.  They would want us to commit trades in exchange for equity.  I am not interested in the equity, but I told them I would distribute the idea to the proper people.  It is also being floated around the London office.  If you want, you can respond to this guy directly or I can take care of it.

Kevin Garland
