Calling it an error is unfair.  I am not prepared to offer her AND her husband a job by Friday.  She concedes that her role on the power side may be project-like and therefore short-term.  I will keep in touch with her and open the door later.  London is being freaky about people finding homes ASAP, and it doesn't match my timeframe.

As I said in the note of yesterday - I have no interest in having the meeting. My assistant is away so its just a  misunderstanding.   See yesterday's note, we are going in on Monday.

I think losing Amita is a  major error.  There are no other candidates in the organisation with her expertise apart from Zipper, Forster and Savita.  

Thanks

Louise

I saw that our Friday meeting got rescheduled until next week, after your budget meeting with OOC.  I'd be interested to know what number you'll be assuming from EOL in those discussions.  I got your email, by the way... we're putting a little more thought into it than that.

Also, Amita is going to accept a project job with UK power.  She needs an answer by Friday on her and her husband's jobs.  Having not spoken to any other candidates but her at this point, I can't commit that soon.  We'll keep in touch with her on the off chance that her power job is short term and she still wants to come to Houston.
