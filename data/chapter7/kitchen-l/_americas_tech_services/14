If we are going to wait until Brian moves to transfer to EEOS then I think we must go forward now and as long as we think the team is necessary then it can reside in EEOS later.

Are we OK to move forward on this?

Louise,

I have revised the memo to reflect comments from Mark H. and Joe D..   Going forward we will have a RAC representative on the team, however, the specific RAC person will change based on the deal.    I suggest that we need to get this team "officially working" in order to get a lot of the TurboPark static out of the system.  We need to make TurboPark work for the projects and make the projects work for TurboPark.  Getting everyone on the same side of the table will help.

Regards,
Brian

Kieth,  

Thanks for the input.   I agree with the contractor qualification process and will work to get someone from RAC involved with the team.

Brian, 

The memo as written is fine. 

 I do have a general concern about the need for a rigid and corporate based qualification process for contractors. Maybe this is influenced by just visiting Dabhol and seeing first hand the problems we have created by using marginally qualified contractors, but to me it would make sense to have a corporate based team including RAC for this function.  Financial positions of Engineering and Construction contractors are difficult to understand. It is a business that does not neatly fit a yearly reporting concept and requires significant experience to evaluate. I doubt your EPC team will have the time to adequately perform this function.  A small team continuously working as a committee on the evaluation of contractors could prevent a lot of tears. I believe strongly in looking at new contractors especially private ones with strong leadership, but we need to clearly identify the risk.  In addition the entire E&C  industry is at risk due to thin margins and/or risk.

Keith
