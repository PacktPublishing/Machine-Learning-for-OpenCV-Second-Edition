Louise,

Attached per your request are two org charts for the Tech Services Group--one for no adds and one including four staff adds.  These are similar to what was presented to you before but adjusted to delete the third gas guy as discussed.  Staffing lists for each case are also provided.  

I would strongly urge management to consider the staff adss proposed.  Especially in light of the move of EOS to EGS, it is even more important that we have sufficien capability to manage our business.  One mis-step can cost us more than our entire budget.

I would be happy for the opportunity to discuss in more detail.  In the meantime, let me know if I can be of any assistance.

Mike
