Guys,

Portland General is long a Sep 30 LM6000 Sprint PC.  Their mini-peaker project has died.  They are giving us a first look before they give it to GE to re-market.   Price = $16.8MM +  115kv step-up transformer.   I could see buying 3-4 for QI but I don't have a need for such an early delivery.  East? Brazil?
