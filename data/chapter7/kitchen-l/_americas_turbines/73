Louise:

I have a call in to Ben to discuss the idea.  With respect to your message on Steve Pearlman, I worked with him for about a year.  He is extremely intelligent and knowledgeable of the power industry.  He sometimes has a tendency to over-analyze issues, but I think he understands risks in the industry much more than many people in our organization.  He has closed and can close transaction.  I have a lot of respect for him and I think he will more than pay for himself in the long-run (responding to your question on how much he will make).

Brett

What I was trying to call you about was an idea.  The way Ben and Chris currently run the turbine book is they share everything 50:50 - upsides and downsides.  I thought it might be a good idea to involve you so the turbine book is split 33:33:33.  Obviously there is a transfer price out to projects (internal and Riogen would be included) but this would mean our successful turbine team would have all the right incentives to assist you with the Mitsubishis.

If you think its a good idea - please talk to Ben or Chris (Calger) who have discussed this themselves.

You would need an out for RioGen agreed upfront.

Regards

Louise
