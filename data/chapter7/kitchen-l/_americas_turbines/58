Louise,
We received your note of July 2.  Rather than forcing you into the role of arbitrator at the outset, we decided to try to resolve the turbine transfer issues with Chris Calger first.  Accordingly we had forwarded a proposal to Chris on Friday, and together with Chris we worked out a revised proposal yesterday, incorporating some of the concepts in your note.  Chris will be reviewing the revised proposal with Ben tomorrow to get his input, and Chris planned to touch base with you afterwards.
