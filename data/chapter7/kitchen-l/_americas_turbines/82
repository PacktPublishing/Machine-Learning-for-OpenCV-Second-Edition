Sorry for the delay in getting back to you. I'm on vacation this week, and did not pick up my mail until late yesterday afternoon.

Brett and I have been working through our respective groups on finalizing numbers for the Ft. Pierce turbine. I expect that we should have numbers tomorrow. The only issue on this has been to make sure we are properly allocating change orders and spare parts between the two MHI turbines which are presently under one contract. By tomorrow, we expect to have a proposed cost allocation and will then present it to Brett for his review and approval. 

With respect to the second MHI unit, Dave Duran, Ozzie Pagan and I have a call scheduled tomorrow to discuss the Homestead project. On the development side, we will know where we stand with respect to local approvals by mid-May. We are in the process of obtaining permits for a facility of up to two MHI 501Fs. At least to this point, our proposed site has not raised the type of controversy we have experienced in Broward County.

Lastly, I wanted to make sure you knew that we received our final local approvals for our Midway site in St. Lucie County. Greg Krause ( a director in my group) and his team really stepped up to the plate to deliver on this. This project is now one of the only fully permitted merchant peaker projects in Florida.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Regards,

Ben

Subject:	Turbines from ESA

As I see it, the information below outlines our current turbine position.  Please could you confirm that the transfer pricing has been completed between North America and South America on the transfer of the Mitsubishi turbine for Fort Pierce, we will be transferring a second turbine across from ESA to ENA for the Homestead project.  

I recognize that there may be a requirement for 2 turbines for Homestead but I assuming that you will come and see me with regard to this before we reallocate further from ESA.

Please complete both transfers this week and let John and I know the numbers at which transfer occurred.

Thanks

Louise
