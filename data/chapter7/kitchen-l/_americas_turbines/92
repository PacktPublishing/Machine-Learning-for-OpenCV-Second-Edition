By the way, did you have a discussion with CALME on the carrying costs on the Westinghouse 501D5A?

EEL is now selling its 9FAs (previously mentioned for Arcos), I referred John Sherriff to you to see if you have any potential outlets for these turbines. So in case someone telephones you, that is where the call comes from.
