Fyi, see Theresa's email below.

I think this will clear up the issues we discussed yesterday. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Ben - per our discussion yesterday, the following changes have been made to the August Asset List that is presented to Louise:

Austin  - $0
E-Next Fees - $0 (off-balance sheet)  Since this is being accrued for monthly, we decided not to show it at all to avoid confusion.
Ft Pierce - MHI turbine NOT shown on ENA list - (off-balance sheet)

please call me with any questions.

thanks!

I forwarded your voice mail about the hotlist items to Trey Hardy.  He updates the hotlist weekly.
