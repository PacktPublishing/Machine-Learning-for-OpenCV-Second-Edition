Enron Canada may be close to selling the ABB units for over $35MM.  Please refrain from offering a lower price to brokers, consultants, etc. on these units for a week.  We should still mention them as available and should still work on putting them on EOL (if this party is real, it might be slick to have them close the transaction electronically!).
