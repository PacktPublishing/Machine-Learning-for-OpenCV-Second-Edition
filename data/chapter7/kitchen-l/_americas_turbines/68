Sorry I didn't reply last week but I promised myself I wouldn't reply to anyone unless I had had six hours sleep!  

Anyway - how I thought we had left it was that you were going to aproach them on splitting the cost - $1.3m each and that would be it.  Ask them if this is OK - if not let's sort it out next week.

Thanks

Louise

Did you have further discussions with Jim Hughes?  I have consistently held the line with Global Assets that we would take at cost.  Their response has been that they will keep it.  Let me know.

Wes,
This relates to the Calme 501D5A turbine we discussed in your office with Ben Jacoby & Jeff Sommers.  To refresh your memory, Ben has a buyer identified, and is willing to accept the transfer of the costs of $22.9mm from Calme.  However, he does not want to take the carrying costs of $2.6mm Calme has incurred to date.  In the meeting, you said that you would discuss the transfer price with John/Louise.  We are being asked for coding so Global Assets can transfer of the full amount.
 
Please advise,
Jody

Mauricio - per Ben, the transfer price is in Louise Kitchen's hands.  It is my understanding that she will be back in the office next week, so hopefully we can wrap this up soon.

Theresa,
Please provide me with the company number and cost element that the Westinghouse Turbine should be transferred to.
 
Thanks,
