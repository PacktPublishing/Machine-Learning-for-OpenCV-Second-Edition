Louise,

Attached is the most recent turbine position report.  I will also request that you be added to the distribution list for this report in the future.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Regards,

Dave

I understand that RAC keeps a list of all of the turbine positions - so you know where I would be able to get hold of it.

Thanks

Louise
