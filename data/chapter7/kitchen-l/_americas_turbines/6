No significant good news.

ABB:
- Canada leads still alive but not making any own payments
- Virgo trying to get a bid from ABB for the DLN combustor package and associated technology rights
- Thome got a bid from New brunswick Power which would net us $25K per month for the winter (NEPOOL ICAP less startup and O&M)
- Thome trying to structure a better bid from our desk (EPMI's NEPOOL ICAP bid = $160K per month, but we dont know the cost of transmission to NEPOOL)

501D5A:
- 2 brokers looking at the machines - no general interest

MHI501F
- 6 brokers are reviewing packages with their clients: no tangible bids yet
- Brett looked at MHI contract: can not terminate, but their is a provision for MHI and buyer to cooperate on resales - Brett to explore
- Brett offered these under a Brazil RFP; no response yet
- Allegheny/NEPCO: big news of the week.  NEPCO is bidding on a project Allegheny wants to do in Arizona using all four MHIs.  We are inserting ourselves into the process to ensure that (i) NEPCO prices the turbines and the EPC contract agressively; (ii) Allegheny understands that we can separate the turbines in case they just want to buy them.  Ben, Brett, Ron Tapscott and I to meet on this today.  ENA/NEPCO/Allegheny meeting tomorrow

7FA:
- Calpine finally withdrew their bid (after we mitigated their one concern re the project - BPA transmission)
- Negotiating with NRG: Their verbal bid is -$5MM to -$8MM, but they have been slow because they just lost 2 developers/tech guys.  We are offering them access to Turbopark so their return on equity improves; we are also offering up development/tech people: temporary or permanent as part of the deal; We told them we can discount the EPC contract or the equipment contracts or write them a check for the $5MM discount.
- Other project candidates we are working with include Black Hills, TransAlta, Mirant
- We are also seeing what other sites (in the east) could benefit from the 7FA train
