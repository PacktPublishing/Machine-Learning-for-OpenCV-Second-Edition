Regarding the potential for Enron to work on another Vitro type project, the attached email gives the name of the company with whom we were discussing the turbine sale.  We are trying to find out more information on the project and will forward that to you as we receive it.  If you would like me to deal with someone directly in Mexico, please let me know who that should be.  We are also working with Maria Elena Garcia to develop potential customers in Mexico for a straight turbine sale.  She has indicated that she believes there may be some additional potential for cogen applications with these units.

Thanks,
Brett

Brett,

The name of the Mexican company is Energia Industrial Rio Colorado SA de CV. The company is located in the Mexican State of Sonora (Mexico), near to the US border. The project was originally projected to deliver power inside the fence (co-generation) and to the US (California).

I left a voice mail with the broker. I'll keep you updated on any news I may have.

Diego
