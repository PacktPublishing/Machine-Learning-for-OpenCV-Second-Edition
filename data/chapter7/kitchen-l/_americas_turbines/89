Yes. I've attached the most recent map, and can provide you with our list of each option if you like. This list includes all relevant terms of our site options, but as such is very detailed. Let me know if you want a copy.

Thanks,

Ben

Do you also run the site bank - if so can you email me a status report on what's in it.

Thanks

Louise
