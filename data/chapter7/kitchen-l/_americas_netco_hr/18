My current understanding is an anticipated close of February 8th (Friday). 

There are a number of matters we will need to communicate to employees between now and then. While we may decide that consolidating these matters into a single communication is not practical/desirable, I would like to make sure that all employee communications are co-ordinated. Below is an initial list of the general matters that we have currently identified as needing to be addressed with my understanding of who is taking the lead:


HR Matters					Audrey Martin/David Oxley/Robert Jones/Neil Davies
Deadlines for o/s offers
Payroll switch over
First few checks to home address
Benefits coverage/elections
Orientations
Enron departure letter/process
Return of Enron proprietary documents/info

Buildings Access/Security Badges		Rocco Velpri/Bill Donovan/Cindy Olson/Wes Colwell
New badge arrangements
Access to Enron premises
Use of Gym, Doctors office, Restaurant, kids centre
Access for Enron ee's to NETCo floors
Ongoing Car parking, Bus passes et al

Cell phones/Blackberrys/Pagers		Wes Colwell/Jenny Rub/?
Transfer arrangements
Return of equipment

Email addresses/Network Access/et al		Jenny Rub/?
New logons/passwords
Old files return to Enron

Stationary and General Admin		Wes Colwell/Tammy Shepherd
Business Cards
Letterhead, et al
Ordering of office supplies
Return of Enron supplies

Business Expenses				Audrey Martin/David Oxley/Wes Colwell
Process going forward
Training/procedures/payment schedule
Reimb. of outstanding Enron expenses

All Employee Communications		Mark Palmer/ David Walker
On launch celebration/bon voyage
Subsequent update/mediums

Please let me have your comments/recommendations on above. Given the NETCo employee list is not yet finalised, I will be the point of contact to confirm correct headcount and names.
