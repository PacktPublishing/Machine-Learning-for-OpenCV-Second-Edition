Issue is headcount approval. In the next 6 months I'm not sure we can commit to any increase, although if we get a flying start in Canada it is possible. While I think we can explore whether UBS are interested elsewhere, my feeling is that we can't commit to anything at this stage. If things are different in July them maybe we can reconsider if they haven't found something elsewhere.

David, we made offers to 4 new grads a few months ago to work for Enron Canada Corp. ECC is obviously going to renege on these offers. Is there any opportunity to have these offers assigned to UBS Warburg Energy. All four of these new grads are outstanding and the timing should be aligned with business ramping up (ie June - Sept timeframe). The estate would be cooperative with assigning the offers and the students are looking for clarity/comfort.
