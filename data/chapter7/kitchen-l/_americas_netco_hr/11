Great!  That sounds logical and much more simple than preparing entirely new agreements.  I hadn't seen a template, but would be happy to assist by either preparing or reviewing one.  Let me know if I can provide any assistance.  Michelle

     Michelle:

     I think what was discussed is simply a cover letter to annex to the
     contracts indicating the name of the new entity. Lou/Audrey-didn't we
     prepare a template for this ?

Jordan,

Do you have any information on new contracts for Canada?

Thanks.

        The name for the Canadian entity which will enter into both Master Agree
ments and individual commodity transactions is: "UBS Warburg Energy (Canada) Ltd
.", as confirmed by Lou Eber: UBS Chief Legal Counsel.

        I am working on chasing down the parental guarantee issue.

        Dave
