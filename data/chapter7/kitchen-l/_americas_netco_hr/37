Lavo said he is not keeping track of these dollars.  Greg said I should communicate to the two of you what I have done.

Employee:		Old Sign-On		New Sign-On
George Wood		70K			80K
Andrea Woodland	15K			25K
Chris Lackey		30K			35K
Jeff Shields*		30K			35K
Laura Wente*		35K			35K
		Total:	!80K			210K

*Part of original $11MM pool, but new offer (instead of Choi and Rosman)
