Louise,

Do you think we should arrange events for the remote offices as well?

Thank you,
Julie

Louise, 

We have been trying to get something arranged for this Friday.  UBS has special events personnel that arrange these types of events including what we saw at the Houstonian a few weeks ago.  It is my understanding that we are awaiting approval from Mike Hutchins before making any arrangements.  Informally, I have spoken with Jillian's and Sambuca regarding availability for a Friday afternoon event.  However, absent using yours or Greg's credit card, we will need approval through UBS prior to booking any formal event.

Kind regards,
Julie

So I have a couple of people in my team trying to organise something for Friday. Would either or both of you be game to do a floor talk, presuming we have closed?

David

For the shin-dig we'll have on Friday (if Hutch approves), do you thing we could get John, Louise, and Greg to say a word?
