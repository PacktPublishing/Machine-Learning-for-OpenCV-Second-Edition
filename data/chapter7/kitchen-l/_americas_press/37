Kal, Please provide David with as many statistics as he needs for his book.  Could you also make sure that David gets help in turning around any comments on any quotes etc he may want to use for his book as I understand they have some pretty short timescales.

I have attached a couple of recent presentations and the old presentation from the analyst conference in January.




Thanks

Louise
