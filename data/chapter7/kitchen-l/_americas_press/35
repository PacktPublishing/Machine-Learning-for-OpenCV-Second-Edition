BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

EBS Joins EWS
Effective, July 12, EBS has become a business unit within Enron Wholesale S=
ervices.  All EBS commercial support functions will be integrated into thos=
e units within EWS, which enables us to better manage the resources and cos=
ts of the support functions.

All EBS commercial functions have been consolidated into the following unit=
s:
Europe - headed by Matthew Scrimshaw
Asia - headed by Anthony Duenner
Americas - headed by Rich DiMichele

Additionally, the North American EBS origination teams have been consolidat=
ed into one group, led by Stewart Seeligson.  North American trading and ri=
sk management will continue to report to Paul Racicot.  Paul will also over=
see the global portfolio from a risk management perspective.

Global Network Operations will continue to report to the EBS Office of the =
Chairman.

All EBS asset positions will continue to be reviewed and repositioned to mo=
st effectively meet the future needs of EBS and the Portland office will be=
 closed by October 1.


Global Strategic Sourcing
Effective July 1, a number of measures and recommendations have been implem=
ented to reduce expenditures associated with, among other things, travel an=
d entertainment, and professional services.  Global Strategic Sourcing ("GS=
S") will undertake this very important initiative and they would like to en=
list your support in the implementation of these new procedures.

This message will focus on Travel and entertainment.  Next week's message w=
ill focus on professional services.

Travel and Entertainment - Enron has a tremendous opportunity to save on tr=
avel and entertainment expenditures by making some relatively painless adju=
stments.

?=09Air Travel - Air transportation is the single largest component in the =
travel mix.  In recognition of this fact, a number of significant discounts=
 have been negotiated with all of the major carriers.  There are two separa=
te channels available to employees to access the Enron-negotiated fares.  T=
he first is Travel Agency in the Park ("TAP"), or the GSS-approved preferre=
d travel agency for your location, and the second is the new Enron-managed =
online travel booking service, ClickTrip, located at <http://clicktrip.enro=
n.com/enron>.

Over the coming weeks, GSS will be promoting training and usage of ClickTri=
p, as the primary method of booking domestic U.S. travel for a number of re=
asons.  First, excluding proprietary carriers like Southwest Airlines, Clic=
kTrip provides employees easy access to all travel and pricing options for =
their destination, including the Enron-negotiated fares.  Second, industry =
data shows that employees will generally make the most cost-effective trave=
l decision when presented with the relevant facts.  Conservatively speaking=
, we estimate that a 20% savings in airfare is attainable through the use o=
f this tool alone.  Third, it is relatively painless to use.  Fourth, Click=
Trip is accessible 24X7 from any internet-enabled personal computer and aft=
er-hours telephone support is available. If you have travel-related questio=
ns, please contact Tracy Ramsey at ext. 6-8311.
=20
One final air travel reminder worth promoting: For employees who fly in the=
 United States, use of non-refundable coach tickets generally runs 65 perce=
nt less than refundable tickets and can usually be changed by simply paying=
 a $100 fee.

?=09Lodging and Car Rental - GSS has also negotiated preferred rates at a n=
umber of hotel chains in many cities worldwide to accommodate your business=
 unit's individual hotel policy. Additionally, preferred car rental rates i=
ncluding insurance coverage with National (U.S. and Canada) and Alamo (U.S.=
) have been negotiated for your use.  More detailed information is availabl=
e regarding both programs through our travel site located at <http://travel=
.enron.com>.

Enron Industrial Markets - Forest Products
EIM began trading in the physical markets for Forest Products (newsprint, p=
ulp, recycled paper, and lumber) in August, 2000 and Steel in January, 2001=
.  Since then EIM has handled over 140,000 tons of recycled paper, 180,000 =
tons of newsprint, 150,000 tons of pulp, 160 million board feet of lumber, =
and 210,000 tons of steel.  Currently on a weekly basis, EIM is moving appr=
oximately 20,000 tons of forest products (newsprint, pulp and recycled pape=
r), 3 million board feet of lumber, and 10,000 tons of steel products throu=
ghout the world. =20

Due to much larger volumes of forward trading, EIM is expanding its physica=
l product delivery capabilities around the world to physically handle 5 mil=
lion tons per year.  The EIM Logistics Group coordinates the activities of =
customer service, supply and demand matching, scheduling of owned assets, a=
nd physical transport and warehousing.  These activities are primarily coor=
dinated through the Houston office, with additional resources in London and=
 Singapore.

Additionally, EIM owns paper mills in Quebec City and New Jersey which have=
 a combined production capacity of 750,000 tons of newsprint per month, and=
 a cold rolling steel mill in Arkansas with capacity of 400,000 tons per ye=
ar.  Each of these facilities includes Logistics resources that are coordin=
ated through the EIM Logistics Group.

Enron Global Markets - LNG
Enron Global LNG has enhanced its Atlantic Basin LNG supply portfolio with =
volumes from Nigeria LNG Limited (NLNG).  Enron Global LNG recently signed =
a Memorandum of Understanding with NLNG for delivery of 1 BCM/ year (billio=
n cubic meters) or (97,000 Mcf/day) from the NLNG Plus Project.  This is a =
two train expansion of NLNG's existing Bonny Island LNG production facility=
.  The expansion is scheduled for completion in 2005.  This deal represents=
 a major step in the establishment of Enron's global LNG network.

EGM - Finance & Structuring
On June 29, 2001, Enron Global Markets - LNG Group successfully completed t=
he divestiture of its 100% equity interest in Progasco, to CHDR, Inc. via a=
n all cash transaction.  Progasco sells and distributes LPG to commercial a=
nd industrial clients, and independent resellers, through a fleet of tanker=
 trucks, bobtail trucks and 13 filling plants throughout Puerto Rico.  CHDR=
, Inc. is the record and beneficial owner of all of the issued and outstand=
ing shares of stock of Tropigas de Puerto Rico, Inc. ("Tropigas").  Upon co=
mpletion of this transaction, Tropigas, hitherto the 3rd largest market pla=
yer will operate the newly consolidated entity and control a 35% market sha=
re, becoming the 2nd largest Puerto Rican LPG marketer.=20

The sale proceeds of approximately $14.3 million, have been split between P=
rotane (a wholly owned Enron Corp. Delaware subsidiary) and San Juan Gas (S=
JG), and were used to pay down inter-company debt owed to SJG and Pro Carib=
e.  The net (pre-tax) gain recorded on the transaction was $3.9 million.=20

The profitable sale of this strategic asset allows EGM to exit the retail p=
ropane business it inherited through the 1985 merger of three companies: Pr=
otane, Petrolane and Imperial Gas, and will enable Enron to better deploy t=
he cash received and more efficiently manage its Puerto Rican human resourc=
es.=20

EGM - Weather
The Weather group just completed a deal with People's Energy to protect the=
m against lower gas prices during a warmer than normal winter.  This innova=
tive winter protection was structured to manage People's exposure to both t=
he volume and price of natural gas.  Greg Penman and Bob Beyer, from the Ch=
icago office, were the lead dealmakers for this transaction.  Simlar deals =
with other counterparties are expected to come over the winter season.
Also, the Weather Group has started exploring new opportunities with EES.  =
To support this effort, Elsa Piekieniak has joined the group.  Elsa is look=
ing for several people to help her with this initiative.  If you're interes=
ted in a position, please contact Elsa.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

UPDATE ON ENRON EUROPE'S CONTRIBUTION TO 2ND QUARTER RESULTS
Congratulations to all staff for your contribution to another fantastic qua=
rter! =20

By now we hope you will have had an opportunity to read about Enron's Q2 ea=
rnings, which were released to the investment community in Houston on Thurs=
day, 12th July.  Overall the business has seen continued strong growth with=
 revenues increasing to over $100 million in the first half of the year up =
from $30 million for the same period last year.  Earnings per share this qu=
arter also exceeded analyst expectations and came in at $0.45 for the quart=
er up from $0.34 for the same period last year.

Equally important, however, is the vital role Enron Europe played this quar=
ter in contributing to the company's overall results.   We are seeing some =
terrific trends here in Europe - notably, on the wholesale side, the Contin=
ental, UK and Nordic power and gas teams keep going from strength to streng=
th as we see exceptional growth in volumes and transactions continue this q=
uarter.  Total physical and financial settled volumes for gas and power in =
Europe have seen an increase of 172% in the first six months of the year co=
mpared to the first six months in 2000 and the total number of transactions=
 per day has risen to 604 from 272 last year.  Specifically, UK power volum=
es are up 204% to 147 TWh in the first six months of 2001 from 48 TWh in th=
e same period last year.  Continental gas volumes have grown from 351 Bbtue=
/day in 2000 to 1,390 Bbtue/day in 2001 - a 296% increase - and Continental=
 power volumes have seen growth of 360% with volumes rising from 18 TWh in =
the first six months of 2000 to 83 TWh for the same period this year.  The =
growth in volumes is not simply limited to the UK and Continental markets, =
however, as Nordic power volumes have increased by 153% from 29 TWh to 73 T=
Wh in the first half of 2001.

The success stories are not just limited to gas and power trading, however,=
 and abound throughout the business:

Enron Energy Services
The retail business has experienced a real boost this quarter with the clos=
ing of EES' first, major "marquis" brand energy outsourcing transaction wit=
h supermarket giant, J. Sainsbury plc.  Of equal importance, Enron Direct's=
 business continues to grow with total customers now in excess of 160,000. =
 The success of Enron Direct's business model has translated into the devel=
opment of new business on the Continent in the Netherlands and Spain and, m=
ore recently in North America, with the 2nd quarter opening of Enron Direct=
 Canada. =20

Enron Credit
A year after Enron Credit's launch, the total life to date notional value o=
f transactions has surpassed $11.8 billion and in the 2nd quarter alone, En=
ron Credit generated $10.4 million in EBIT.  Further, more than 20,000 read=
ers per week view the Enron Cost of Credit (ECC) through independent public=
ations.  =20

Enron Australia
With 2nd quarter power volumes up 177% from the first three months this yea=
r, Enron Australia is gearing up for a strong growth year.  With the develo=
pment of a physical power position key to expanding Enron's power trading i=
n Australia, work began this quarter to identify and begin the initial purs=
uit of asset development projects.  Other businesses undergoing significant=
 expansion this quarter were coal, renewable energy credits and weather der=
ivatives.=20

Spain:  Arcos
The Arcos asset development project in Spain continues to make great progre=
ss with third party access to gas supplies for the power project being succ=
essfully negotiated this quarter, plus the project achieved another milesto=
ne in the permit/government approvals arena with the granting of its water =
concession in Q2.

UK:  ETOL
ETOL, a long-standing contributor to Enron Europe's earnings, generated yet=
 another profitable transaction this quarter with the signing of a series o=
f deals with chemical giant Du Pont for supplies at Wilton International. T=
he transaction further strengthens Enron's relationship with Du Pont, one o=
f ETOL's largest customers, and will extend the current steam and power sup=
ply contract through 2010. =20

Enron Metals
A year after entering the metals business, Enron Metals has seen increased =
volumes of 130% in its merchant and financial trading operations this quart=
er with volumes up to over 3.5 million tonnes as compared to just over 1.5 =
million tonnes in the 2nd quarter last year.  Not only has the team seen po=
sitive growth in volumes this quarter, but they have increased their share =
of trading on the LME by 50% and are making significant progress with Proje=
ct Salem - a major IT and systems improvement project that will streamline =
deal capture and risk management for metals transactions.  Finally, the met=
als team achieved a true home run this quarter when they closed a major ten=
-year origination transaction that, through the addition of smelting assets=
, will enable the metals team to improve its trading position.  The transac=
tion proved to be the perfect opportunity to leverage all of Enron's tradin=
g and origination capabilities and involved input from a number of groups a=
cross Enron.  =20

Looking to the future, we have every expectation that the strong growth we'=
ve witnessed in Europe for the first half of the year will continue through=
 end 2001.  So, in the words of Solomon Smith Barney analyst, Ray Niles, wh=
en talking about Enron's European wholesale operations results this quarter=
, "Europe is kicking butt and it's about a quarter of [Enron's] activity, n=
early double what it was last year.  And, that is a new market that is the =
size of the US." =20
