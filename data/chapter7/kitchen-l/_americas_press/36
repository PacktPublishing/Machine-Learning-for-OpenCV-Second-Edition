Subject:  Interview

Kal, Please provide David with as many statistics as he needs for his book.
Could you also make sure that David gets help in turning around any
comments on any quotes etc he may want to use for his book as I understand
they have some pretty short timescales.

I have attached a couple of recent presentations and the old presentation
from the analyst conference in January.
(See attached file: extendedEOL.ppt)



Thanks

Louise
