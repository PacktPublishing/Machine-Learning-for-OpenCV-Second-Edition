It looks like most of these assets relate to systems that Sally Beck's group uses.  These assets were moved off the ENA balance sheet earlier this year after discussions with you and Philippe.  Please advise if you want us to agree to these transfers.  Thanks!

Elaine,

Attached is a listing of the assets on ENW's books that they want to transfer back to EA.  The current book value as of 7/31/2001 is around $9 million dollars that would move into PP&E.  

If you look at the numbers off to the right and the notes below, you will see that some of them were originally designated as shared assets or solely ENW and therefore would reside on ENW's books.

In completing their 2002 plan and meeting with their commercial people, ENW thinks these assets should be back on EA's books.

Please let me know if you agree to this.

Thanks, 
Stacey
