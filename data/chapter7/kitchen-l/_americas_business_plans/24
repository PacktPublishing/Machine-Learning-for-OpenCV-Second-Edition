Louise --

Here is the analysis on how many Govt Affairs' FTEs work on Enron Americas matters.  

The bottom line = 67 Professionals in group / 29 FTEs on Enron Americas.  Call if you want additional information.

Also, I am trying to arrange a meeting for this Friday to discuss our next Monthly Update (which I am finishing hopefully tomorrow).

Thanks,

Jim
