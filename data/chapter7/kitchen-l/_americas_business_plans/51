Hi Louise-
Thought this might be helpful in your review of Canada's cap charge. I've left a new plan for Canada, Upstream (Jean moved her cap charge from Upstream Executive to Offshore), and Restructuring (we adjusted their margin target to ($20.7M) -they've called themselves Merchant Asset Mgmt on the plan presentation- would you like for me to make the name change on our management summary?) Additionally, I've left the February 2001 Team Income Statement booklet for your review as well. These items are in Tammie's chair. Please let me know if you have any questions- x30352. Thanks!

Faith,

Per Hope's voicemail, here is the support for the $3.6MM Capital Charge for Canada's plan.  I've also included a reconciliation between Delainey's number and Canada's number.  Please let me know if you would like to discuss further.

 

Thanks,
Laynie
