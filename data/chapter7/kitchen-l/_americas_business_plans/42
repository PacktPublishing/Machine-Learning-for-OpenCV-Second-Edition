Hi Louise,

Attached are the May YTD soft Metrics for North America. In response to open items from last month:

(1) Canada had some concern related to the information provide for average EOL transaction count. After working with EOL and Canada, it was determined that the number of trading days that Canada used to calculate this metric differed from the number of days EOL used to calculate this metric. The EOL team and Canada are working to come to an agreement related to this as well as new customer presentation.

(2) Canada felt that the Origination metric was incorrect. We have sent them the support for the origination amount, which ties to the DPR, along with deal number, etc. (the same info that you see in the first attachment.) We are still awaiting a response from them. 

Currently we include deals with zero value within the deal count (you will see this on the attachment). Are you in agreement with this treatment?

Please let me know if you have any questions- I'm at x30352. Thanks!
