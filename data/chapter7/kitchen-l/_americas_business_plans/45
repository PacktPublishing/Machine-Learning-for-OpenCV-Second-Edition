Faith, attached please find the revised soft targets for Enron Canada for the first quarter.  Please call me if you have any questions or concerns.

Regards, Nella Cappelletto (Assistant to Rob Milnthorp)

PS:  Could you kindly call me tomorrrow (403-974-6971) to discuss how and where the information is collected to prepare these reports.  I am curious why our numbers did not match the numbers in the initial reports forwarded to us by Louise Kitchen.  Thank you.

Rob,
Can I get the revised data from you to ensure that we reflect the correct information for Canada? Also, who can I speak with that can help me work with the EOL group to rectify this issue? I'm at x30352  if you have any questions. Thanks!

Louise, just a heads up - we have identified a large number of discrepancies wrt the Canadian numbers for EOL. I'm having my guys verify their respective numbers and we will send you a revised summary for Canada.

Regards
Rob
