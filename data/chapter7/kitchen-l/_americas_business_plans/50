Hi Louise-
Are you okay with adding two new lines to East Power on the Management Summary- one to read Options Desk and one to read Services desk?

Faith,

I spoke with Kevin Presto this morning and he informed me of two newly created groups within East Power.  The Options Desk is headed up by Harry Arora and currently has margin reflected on the DPR.  There is also a Services Desk which falls under Lloyd Will.  Kevin has requested two new costs centers to capture expenses and would like to see two new lines added to the Management Summary to reflect their P&L.

Thanks, Paula
