Hi Louise,
Are you okay with combining Retail and Executive, or should I check with John?

I will be taking over the weekly hotlist from Marlene Cameron and will be sending the weekly updates vis e-mail.  Rob Milnthorp has requested that the following change be made to the Weekly Management Summary Report (2nd Qtr. 2001 Earnings Estimate):  

Eliminate the Retail (Milnthorp) line and shift the balances into the Executive (Milnthorp) lines.

Can you respond to me via e-mail once the above request has been addressed?

 

Thank you

Grant
