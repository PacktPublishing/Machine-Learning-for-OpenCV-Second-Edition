Attached is the revised list with changes you requested.  I spoke with Frank Vickers about a few of the entries to ensure they were not duplicates with regards to Cities and their departs.  He advised that we would consider them two customers.

Example:	Talahassee, City of 
		Talahassee Electric & Gas Department

Frank's group is working on a second generation list which would have the first column represent the Holding Co, and the next column the subsidiary; this would greatly assist with sorting the information.   After your review I can send back to the gas teams and ask them to populate some of the missing data if you wish.

Regards,
Tammy
