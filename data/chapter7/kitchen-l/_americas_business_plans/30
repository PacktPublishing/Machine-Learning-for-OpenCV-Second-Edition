I dont know what any of this stuff is and this is the first time I've seen any $$s. 

I dont even see gas trading vision (maybe its the 'global trading vision'). 
Operational capacity, System Main, Fundamentals, Global Val, and Peoples all have other business sponsers. I cant image what 'IT Commer. Coord' is.

Geoff,
Please review the attached listing and advise if you agree to the projects and amounts listed as billings that Enron North America will receive in 2002 for support of these efforts. I'm at x30352 if you have any questions. Thanks!		 << File: Gas Projects.xls >>
