Stephanie,
For the Long-Term Fundamentals/Transport  2001 Goals and Objectives please replace the items under Strategy with Julie's comments below. Thanks,  I'll review a final copy when you're done and then we can forward to Julie by e-mail. Thanks as always Steph.

Strategy
	*  Detail out key product and market strategies necessary to grow our existing business
	*  Develop a trading platform for pipelines to post and transact primary natural gas capacity
	*  Provide origination and trading groups with energy related geographic information (GIS)
	*  Develop a regulatory position to present to the FERC proposing fundamental changes to current transportation trading rules

Everything else can be left as is (though I do not know where you got the 2000 forecast numbers since this group did not exist until this year)

Julie  :-)
