Louise,

To make our ENW budget discussions most meaningful, we felt that coupling discussions of the Operations and IT Development budgets will make the most sense.  To insure that we have the appropriate attendees in our  ENW 2002 plan meetings and to schedule these meetings around Thursday as a religious holiday, I have worked with Wes Colwell and made a trade with Vince Kaminski to make all of this happen.  There is no change to your calendar in terms of date, time or location of meetings.  We have simply realigned topics and attendees as follows: 

Date			Time		Location	Revised Group			Revised Attendees 

Wed, 9/26		11 - Noon	EB3314		Canada Support (unchanged)	Wes Colwell, Faith Killen, Louise
											Kitchen, Sally Beck, Rob Milnthrop,
