Thank you for your email I would think you should talk to Greg Piper as
soon as possible.  Greg, apart from running the Origination Group of Enron
Net Works, is also its COO.  Greg does currently have a lot of
opportunities in his group which may suit your skill set.

Regards

Louise

Subject:  Update - WaterDesk


Louise -

First, congratulations on your resent position change. Sounds like an
exciting and challenging opportunity for you.

Second, you may have already heard but I just wanted to touch base with you
and give you an update on WaterDesk. American Water Works on Friday
notified
us that they have decided to pass on the acquisition of WaterDesk. This is
unfortunate for both the industry and WaterDesk as a whole. We are
immediately positioning WD to sell the individual assets as feasible and
have severed the team effective 3/16/01. Thank you for providing the names
of your Directors within Networks, the team has been in contact with the
various names you provided us. Alex and myself will be remaining to work
with various systems integrators and any other potential purchasers
interested in the "parts" of WaterDesk during the next several weeks.

And finally on a personal note, I was incredibly impressed with you and the
way you carried yourself during our meeting last month.  It was refreshing
to speak to someone as high energetic as you and to talk to someone who
really "get's it" at Enron. I'd be interested if you had any opportunities
and/or suggestions for an individual such as myself given my background in
developing and executing new business strategies for clients in the
consulting arena and most recently leading the WaterDesk from a product to
a
services focused company.

I look forward to any suggestions you may have. Regards, Karen Welsch.
