My only concern is that John (I am told) spoke to gas and power folks at his staff meeting a while back on the process on transfers. As long as they are rated a 3 or higher in PRC then they did not need to have it approved. Most go through HR, however, some we find out after the fact. I am just trying to make sure we could meet your expectation.  Do you want to say something at your next staff meeting?

You do not need to send any note to any people - just make sure we see them all.  This change applies to Gas and Power.

Louise, prior to you sending me the revised guidelines on transfers/hires last week, I wanted to give you details on the folks that were already in process before the change:


1.  Steve Bartlet received a transfer offer from Lloyd Don Miller in asset market effective 9/1/01.  Don had indicated that he had planned to speak to you Monday 8/27/01.  He did considerable investigation on this employee to ascertain that he would be a fit for the group.  The employee was rated a 4 at midyear.

2.  Dave Ingram was hired by Dana Davis to do realtime trading at the senior specialist level.  He was a transfer from EBS as a redeployed employee. Feedback was positive and he was rated a 3 at mid year and excellent at yearend.


3.  Eric Simpson was hired to work for Fletch Sturm as a commerical director.  He was rated 1 at midyear and a 2 at yearend. As per the email I recceived from Kevin Presto, I am told that both you and John are aware.


4.  Berney Aucoin in EWS made an offer to an analyst out of the program for a specialist level (flat compensation). Rogers Herndon approved as this employee was rated a 5 at midyear, however, they feel in the past that he was not appropriately guided at EWS.  They feel that they can assist in turning this employee around and have developed a Performance Improvement Plan. Robert Jones is aware.


5.  Steve Irvin was in the process of making an offer to Carlos Alatorre for the Monterrey office. I believe that you are aware as this employee would be a transfer from EOL.  I am awaiting a response from Steve on the status.


I will be sending out a note to Kevin, Dave, Don, Steve, Rogers and both Jaimes to let them know about the change in process on what you would like to be included on going forward.
