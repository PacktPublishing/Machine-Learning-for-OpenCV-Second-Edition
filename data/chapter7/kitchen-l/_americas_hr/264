Louise:

I have hired an EES Manager (Nick Politis) to fill a mid-market role in East Power. Subsequent to hiring the candidate, I learned from Kim Melodick that you and/or Lavo may want to screen all commercial hires before extending offers. I spoke with Dave Duran before extending the offer. It is Dave's understanding that you and John L. will screen Director level and above. Mr. Politis was interviewed by 6 commercial people from E. Power. Please let me know if you have a problem with this issue. In addition, if you could provide guidance on commercial hiring protocol, I would appreciate it. Hope this isn't an inconvenience.

Regards,   Ed
