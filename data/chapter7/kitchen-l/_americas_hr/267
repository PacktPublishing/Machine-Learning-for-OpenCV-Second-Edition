Louise and Marcus,

As a reminder, we will be in a holding pattern for the green cards as follows:

	-The Multinational Manager Application was filed for Louise on December 4, 2000.  Approval will take four to 	  twelve months.

	-The Labor Certification was filed for Marcus on December 8, 2000.  The Department of Labor will not respond 	  before one year and may take up to two years to respond.

I need Louise to send over a copy of her new social security card received in the mail and her new prescription card.

The Compensation Team and I had a conference call with PwC on Monday regarding the deferred compensation scheme.  The Compensation Team forwarded copies of the various plans to PwC for review.  We expect something from PwC next week.

Regards,
