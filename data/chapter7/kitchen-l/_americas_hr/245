Louise,

You treated me with a degree of candor and respect this morning that was really refreshing to me, although, I must admit that you caught me off-guard.  If you give me the chance, I will be a leader in your organization.  There is not the slightest doubt in my mind that I can generate the new ideas and the new business that you require of a top performing Vice President.  In fact I am dying to get a chance to prove to you that I can deliver results.  I don't want to loose any more time than I already have; I want to start now.

As you don't know well some of the people who's names I gave you as references,  you might also want to try Scott Neal or Don Black.  Both of them know me quite well and would give you an opinion on my ability to deliver what you are looking for.

Thank you for the opportunity.

Steve
