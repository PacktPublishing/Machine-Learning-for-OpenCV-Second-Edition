Wait until Louise gets back.  These should not be big.  ie 50 and 125 at most.  I'm not even sure that Irvine is the right guy in the end.

Seems to me a sensible move quickly on Steve Irvine and Jaime Williams to get contracts in place following Yzaguirre's departure. I believe Jaime's contract has just expired and Irvine we drafted back in April as part of the blitz approach but never got past the "do Yzaguirre first" obstacle.

What do you think? You want to talk with them or should we go direct to them?
