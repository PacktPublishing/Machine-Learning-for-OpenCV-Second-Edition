Louise - Do you know this gentleman from your days in London?   His resume looks good and he is interested in moving to Houston and working in East Power.
 
John Suarez - You are going to need at least one and probably two solid cash/term traders for the SE region.   Talk to Seresh about this guy.

Kevin, 
thanks for taking a look at this. 
I will talk to you in the next days to see if you think I will make enough money for you.
