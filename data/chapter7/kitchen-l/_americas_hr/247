I just spoke to Lavo and he said the same thing.   We are planning on offering Willis an Associate position in East Power.   I propose we offer 75k salary with 25k sign-on.   We would require a 90 day evergreen non-compete and payback of 25k retention in the event he left within the the 1st year.

Kim - Can you please prepare the offer package based on the above.

Thanks.
