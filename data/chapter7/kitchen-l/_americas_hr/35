Fred called yesterday to let me know he was going to move Lisa Hesse in to replace Judy Thorn on the Well-head Desk. 

 Lisa is a Sr. Spec currently making 48.5K. She was not ranked at mid-yr but was ranked Strong at yr-end.  She is on reduced hours which Fred believes works well for the position.  

Just want to confirm that you are ok with this move to be effective Nov. 5.  Thanks
