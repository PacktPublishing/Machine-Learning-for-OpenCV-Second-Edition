Hello Louise,

Enrico worked for me for 1 year as an new associate. He was weak when he started but got better with time. When I finally lost him I was disappointed but then he was focused on the Italian market and had become very pro-active after I gave him a consistent hard time. I rate him mid range and solid. Not a superstar - so it depends what you need.

I take it Suarez took the Presto job. He is bright and should do well.

Call me when you get in, I'd like a chat.

Later,
M

Louise - Do you know this gentleman from your days in London?   His resume looks good and he is interested in moving to Houston and working in East Power.
 
John Suarez - You are going to need at least one and probably two solid cash/term traders for the SE region.   Talk to Seresh about this guy.

Kevin, 
thanks for taking a look at this. 
I will talk to you in the next days to see if you think I will make enough money for you. 

Best Regards, 
Enrico
