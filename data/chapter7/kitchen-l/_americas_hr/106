Courtney:  I am not sure if you can help me with this but I wanted to try and find someone that could help.  At today's all employee meeting during the Q&A,  someone asked a question about Enron's involvement in Mexico.  The lady that responded to the question mentioned that they are looking for good people to staff the Monterrey, MX office.  

I looked at the Enron jobs listing but found no entries for Mexico.  Do you know how I could find out more about opportunities in Mexico?  If you could give me a name or number that would be great.  (I have no idea who my HR rep or if he or she would know anything about international positions).

Thanks,

Phil Villagomez
