Attached please find information which has been sent to active and inactive deferral plan participants regarding the status of their deferred compensation accounts.   The information consists of a letter which provides details of account balance(s) by plan, life-to-date contributions under most plans, general Q&A's regarding top hat non-qualified deferral plans, the process for preserving a claim with the bankruptcy court and a sample claim form.  We have received many calls and think that this will answer most questions.  Any additional questions regarding deferrals may be forwarded to executive.compensation@enron.com, voice mail 713-345-7960, or to P. O. Box 1188 in care of the Deferral Plan Administration group for a written response.  

We will continue to work with Weil, Gotshal, and Manges LLP to exhaust any reasonable effort as it relates to making payments to the participants of Enron's deferral plans.  

If you have questions, please call me at x35816.
