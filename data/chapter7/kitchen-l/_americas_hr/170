going going gone - he was bitter and uncurable:

Left Calpine (and a bunch of options) 2.5 years ago

Did great his first year

Floundered last year

Joined my group in January - felt like he got screwed by Presto and Jacoby

Never got any traction in my group

He will be a better counterparty - left on good terms, not sure where he's going yet
