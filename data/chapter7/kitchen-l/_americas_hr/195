Welcome back!   I wanted to send you this note to let you know we are planning to hold the Commercial Support PRC Meeting for  ENA tomorrow, June 21, 2001 at 2pm at the Hyatt in the Cottonwood Room.  The following peer groups will be discussed:


Specialist
Sr. Specialist
Commercial Support Manager
Commercial Support Sr. Director

Admin roles will not be discussed.

The primary areas I see going into the meeting that may stimulate discussion historically have been the Sr Specialist callibration and the promotion nominations in this group. Promotion nominations will ultimately be subject to Office of the Chair approval.  

While I believe it would be advantageous to have you present in the meeting, your attendance is optional.  Please let me know if you have any questions.
