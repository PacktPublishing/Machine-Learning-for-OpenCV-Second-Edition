I have talked to Paul again, and he is keen to work in Toronto wholesale origination.  I propose that he starts October 15 as he needs to clean his plate in the UK first.  He will be contacting Brad Richter today to confirm his intent.  Brad knows he was talking to us.  

Rob:
1.  He comes well recommended by Louise
2.  I talked with him a couple times and he seems very personable and capable
3.  I think we should hire him reporting to Borg.  Borg needs additional commercial people to completely cover the market

Dawn, on Rob's say so, please create an offer letter and E-mail to him.  I will send salary proposal on a separate E-mail to you.  You will also need to work out relocation costs from the UK.

Cheers, Paul D

Paul Goddard is a manager in the London office looking to come home to Canada (Calgary or Toronto) and has spoken to Paul in Toronto.  Paul is a strong manager who has been in the organisation for several years.  I know that Paul has a position offer in Dynegy (from Pope obviously).  I think that it would be good for you to have a chat with him to see if there is a fit as I wouldn't want to lose him.  At the moment, he seems very keen on Toronto and working in power retail - he definitely doesn't want to leave Enron.

His number is +44 7748 932298

Thanks

Louise
