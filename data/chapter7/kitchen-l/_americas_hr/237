Louise, sorry I missed you today.  I just wanted to get your ideas for the upcoming performance review meetings for the East Power Team.  My understanding is that John Lavorato may be begining to think about how to approach the midyear process and I wanted to get your thoughts as well.  Would you like to reschedule a time to discuss?
