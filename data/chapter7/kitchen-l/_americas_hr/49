Robert,

Per your suggestion, I am presenting the potential of an internal transfer for David Hernandez.  David was on redeployment from EBS and landed in EES's Portfolio Origination group.  He has interest in moving into Wholesale Service's Power Origination area.  Dave Duran has the intention of offering a lateral transfer (as a Commercial Manager) for David to move into either Ben Jacoby's or Carl Tricoli's group.

David was not reviewed at mid-year '01, because he was on redeployment, but was rated "3" at Year-end '00, and "1" at mid-year '99.  Could you please run the necessary traps to gain approval of this move.  Let me know if you would care for additional information.

Regards,
Todd Peikert
