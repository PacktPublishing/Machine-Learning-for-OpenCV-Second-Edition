As discussed, key members of the Enron Wholesale Services Tax Group have be=
en approached by recruiters and competitors about opportunities outside of =
Enron.  I have received 4 calls in the past 24 hours.  Listed below are the=
 key people comprising the Enron Wholesale Services Tax Planning Group, in =
addition to myself, who possess significant institutional knowledge of Enro=
n's tax position and whose continued employment with Enron (regardless of i=
ts altered state) is critical.  For example, Morris Clark and Jeff Blumenth=
al were key members of the team that, with me, designed and implemented Pro=
ject Slapshot, the continued maintenance of which stands to provide Enron w=
ith over $100 million of tax savings.  I have not spoken with other members=
 of the Enron Tax Department about this matter and, rather, I have come to =
you to obtain proper guidance since the continued employment of the below l=
isted employees directly affects my ability to manage the EWS tax position.=
  As you can appreciate, time is of the essence.  I look forward to speakin=
g with you.
