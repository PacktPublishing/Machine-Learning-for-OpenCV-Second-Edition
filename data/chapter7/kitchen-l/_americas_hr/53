Thanks - Eric mentioned that Dynegy had been pursuing him.  We did however sign up Eric on a 
three year agreement last week.  Too bad about Jonathon but given his back to back
experiences in Japan and LNG it was probably a good move on his part.

Heads Up, I spoke to Jonathon this evening.  I confirmed that Dynegy had been speaking to Eric Shaw at length.  I think the only reason Jonathan got the job was that he asked for less money.
Speak soon
