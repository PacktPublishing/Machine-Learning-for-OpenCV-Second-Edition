My one year anniversary at Enron is June 1st.  At this time, I will be able to apply for transfer into the Analyst Program.  I hope to go back to school in the near future and feel that the Analyst Program along with my Enron experience is the best road to take.  It would be very much appreciated if you would help me in this process by writing a letter of recommendation.  Each of you has been influential to both Enron as a whole and myself.  I could not think of anyone better to represent me in this way.  If you could have this to me by the first week of May, that would be great.

If you need anything from me in this regard, please let me know.   

thank you ,

Adriane

Thank you for your interest in transferring into the program.  In order to transfer you must have at least one year of Enron experience.  Along with your resume we would need three recommendation letters (one from a VP level or higher, one from a current or previous supervisor and the other is your discretion) and a copy of your recent PRC.  You must have a rating of strong or higher on your PRC to be eligible.

The best course of action at this point is to start collecting all this information for your transfer application packet prior to your one year anniversary.  You can submit this information to me about a month from your anniversary date, by having it delivered to EB 1165c.

If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me.

Thanks a bunch!
Althea
