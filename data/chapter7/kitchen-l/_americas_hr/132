Catherine has been in Global inance for Enron Americas for the past year. She has been ranked a Category 1 during year-end 2000 and mid-year 2001 PRC. She is responsible for the financial modeling of all the greenfield project development opportunities being pursued by Origination. She has learned to articulate the banks' concerns with the projects and equipment to be financed within E-Next and other structures to both the originators and accounting. The successful effort Origination has had this year with developments has provided tremendous document flow which has allowed Catherine to develop her document review skills from both a financing and commercial perspective. The growth in maturity she has experienced driven by her deal flow has made her one of the core "go to" junior people in my group when a deal calls for financial analysis. She has been performing at the manager level for six months and is seen as a leader among the junior staff in the group.

Louise and John will be reviewing these early next week.  Since Catherine is eligible and has a 1 rating I do not believe this will be an issue.  

Louise has requested that each manager write a brief statement about why the employee should be promoted.  Please submit it to me by noon tomorrow if possible.  I apologise for the late notice.  The need for a written summary just came up.  If this is an issue, just let me know and we can resolve another way.  Thanks.

Jeanie, is there anything additional I need to do with regards to Catherine Clark's promotion?

Below are the final PRC rankings for the Analysts and /or Associates who were assigned to you for the mid-year PRC process.  Please communicate these results to the appropriate supervisor.  PRC reviews with the Analysts and Associates should be completed by early August, and the signed evaluation forms should be returned to me at EB3539b.  The Program recommends that if asked, the supervisor should provide the actual ranking to the Analyst or Associate.  In addition, we recommend that the PRC representative be involved in providing feedback to the Analyst or Associate.
