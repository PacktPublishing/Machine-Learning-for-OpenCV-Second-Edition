Mike and I both negotiated contracts with Jim Fallon that originally started in September of 1999 that were to end in September of 2001.  These original contracts were signed, I believe, in October or November of 1999.  They were both done under Enron Corp.  Then, in the beginning of 2000, the contracts were redrafted and done under ENA and extended through the end of 2001.  I think that you are missing the original doc that was done in 1999 that had a signing bonus.  If you look at Sept 99 to Sep of 01 Mike was paid 434 in year 1 and 3?? in year 2.  I have asked Mike to bring in the original doc from 1999 that had the signing bonus.  Perhaps HR might have a copy as well.
