Perhaps we need to look at our Managers and Directors again. Independently =
of below it seems appropriate to review key personnel comp following mid ye=
ar PRC. What do you think.

FYI we have most Managers at $90k and Directors at $115.

Please see below.  These will be the new salary levels for the Analyst and =
Associate Program.  They will go into effect on Feburary 1, 2002 for all An=
alysts and Associates rated 4 or better and for the offers being extended w=
ith start dates after that date (2/01/02).  Those AA's rated at the 5 level=
 will not receive a raise until they bring their rating up to the 4 or bett=
er level at the next PRC.  I have provided the old salary levels for your i=
nformation as well as the new levels.  This is the first increase since Jan=
uary of 2000 and brings us up to competitive levels with our competitors in=
 both Houston and elsewhere. .  These numbers are highly confidential and a=
re not to be released at this time to the Program.  However, they will be i=
ncluded as part of the new offer that will go out to the summer interns we =
want to bring back as full time AA's (it is anticipated that these offers w=
ill be part of the exit interview with AA recruiting).  If you have any que=
stions, please feel free to call me.  Ted
