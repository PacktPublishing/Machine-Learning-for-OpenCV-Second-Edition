Davgid,

Joe Deffner taked to Louise, and she said to go ahead with this.  I know you'll want to confirm with her or John, but in the interest of time I wanted to "prompt the system" on your end as well in the hope that there is still time to let the changes hit the end of month payroll.

Let me take a look to see where this is. I thought we agree to leave alone for time being.
