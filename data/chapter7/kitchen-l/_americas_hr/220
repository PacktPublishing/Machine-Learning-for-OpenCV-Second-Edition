Dear Ms. Kitchen,

I am currently working as a V.P. at Commerce One managing the Global Trading
Web.  I have followed Enron's e-commerce activities for some time.  I am
currently exploring other career opportunities and thought I might be able
to contribute to Enron's online initiative.  I previously worked at the
House Energy and Commerce Committee, the FCC, the State Dept, and Jones, Day
Reavis & Pogue.  I not only have experience in the B2B world through my work
at Commerce One, but also in e-commerce generally, trade and
telecommunications through these other positions.  This combination of
experience could be helpful to Enron in expanding your B2B effort, including
governance and interoperability issues, developing new business, and in
dealing with domestic and international regulatory matters related to
e-commerce.

A copy of my resume is attached.  If you have a few moments to talk, I would
greatly appreciate it.

Thanks and best regards,

Ed
