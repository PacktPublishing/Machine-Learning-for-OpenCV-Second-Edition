Dear Louise and Faith
 
I had a review of the spreadsheet and noticed an error in allocation of value for the Central Maine Power deal.  The $5 MM of orig value for this deal was incorrectly allocated to Jeff Ader.  This value should be allocated to myself and George Wood (Woody), who worked with me on the deal.   As for the appropriate split between me and Woody, I think Dave Duran and Ed Baughman should make the call on that (i believe both Dave and Ed are on holiday this week).
 
In addition, I had one other deal that did not make it next to my name.  This deal involved selling ICAP in NEPOOL to New England Power Company and had orig value of $40,000.   I am trying to find a deal number for this.  As we discussed Faith, it is possible that the deal for $40k under Jeff Ader's name is in fact this deal, in which case this value should be reallocated to me.
 
Regards
John

	It might be easier to split it out from the DPR numbers as we are running out of time - please give Faith and I a split of the attached numbers by originator.

	NE Power                (Llodra/Marks)                  9,564,000

	MW Power                (Baughman)                      4,879,000

	Southeast Power (Kroll)                         8,052,000

	Ercot Power             (Tingleaf)                      2,391,000

	Thanks

	Louise

	Hi Louise,

	As requested, attached is a file that contains June YTD Originations by Originator.

	We've arranged the file in the following sorts:

	?       by team

	?       by Originator (sorted alphabetically)

	?       by Originator (sorted by value)

	?       Top 10 Overall Originators by Value

	?       Top 10 Originators- Gas

	?       Top 10 Originators- Power

	An item to note is that not all deals had a related individual's name (such as Enduser)- we left the listing as it appears in the Risk Book in these cases.

	We'll send you an update if the DPR amounts move (the DPR isn't final yet.)

	Please let me know if you need any additional information!
