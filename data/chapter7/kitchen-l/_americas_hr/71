If you are referring to their career progression data, it is not readily available as for domestic employees.
I have to send names to the London office, and a few days later I recieve spreadsheets similar to the one i sent earlier.

Where is the information like the others in order to allow us to make a judgement.

Hi Louise.
I received this spreadsheet from Gemma Butler in London which shows all Director-level and above employees for EEL.
No filters are currently active, and all Female employees are at the top.

 << File: EEL Directors-Gender.xls >> 

Unfortunately, myself and Jean have limited knowledge of the people in the international offices.
Would you be able to identify possible candidates for us?
Here is a breakdown of the current state of the presentation...

Females:
8 Commercial, 1 EEL
6 CS/ ST, no EEL

Males:
10 Commercial, 4 EEL
6 CS/ST, no EEL (primarily have ST).

I think we need a few additional Commercial Females, and a few Male & Female CS candidates to give us a balanced portfolio.
Although I think the London office will be closed by the time I get the names to them today, we should have their data by early next week.
Also, I have included a spreadsheet which includes the career data for the employees Marcello Romano identified, as well as a few others.
There does not appear to be the type of candidates you are wanting, but i'll let you make the call.

Thanks,

Sunjay
