We have scheduled the EWS mid-year PRC meeting to prerate VP's and to review the distribution of all groups below VP on July 10, 2001 (date is on your calendar).  Members of the committee will include Office of the Chairman from each EWS business unit, and MD's.   For EA, in addition to the two of you, we are proposing the following MD's attend:

Tim Detmering
Dave Duran
Joe Kishkell
Rob Milnthorp

Please confirm your agreement with the above list, or let me know of any changes.  I will then send out a notice to all.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks
