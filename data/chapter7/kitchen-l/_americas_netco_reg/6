How would you describe (in terms that a regulator would understand) what is transfered to UBS?  I am asking because I want to make sure that I have a good grasp of what is going to UBS before our FERC pre-meeting.

My understanding is that we are providing software code to is used (a) for all backoffice applications and (b) for a trading platform.  Anything else?
