Wes/Louise, 
Given that the lists are not final I find it difficult to expect that we can make a deadline of Monday at 2:00.  Are you willing to consider the churn on Feb 8 & 9?

Please advise ASAP.

Thanks,
Tammy

Tammy --

Janelle and I met this morning regarding the churn for ECS05/06 et al.

In order to be able to meet the deadline of next weekend, we will have to have all churns submitted no later than Monday, January 28 @ 2:00 pm. We will not be able to allow any adds/changes past that point. 

Should we be unable to meet the deadline at 2:00 on Monday we will need to look at pushing back a week. One option might be (if all churns aren't submitted on time) to move all non UBS people off of ECS 05 & 06 on the 2/1 weekend, and then "shuffle" every eon else the following

thanks, call me if you have any questions
