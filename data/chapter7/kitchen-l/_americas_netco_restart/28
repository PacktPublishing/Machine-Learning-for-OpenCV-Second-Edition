Ryan is waffling.  I talked to him this weekend and he said his wife wants to move back north.   These weather guys need physcology treatement.   Dave now thinks this UBS deal is full of risk.   I think the Friday event has everyone freaked out.
 
Sorry to ruin your Sunday evening.   With respect to fundies, I already have my guys working on this.

Ok So I'm having trouble letting go.......
 
9:00 am  Greg and I and Louise will meet with the back office to discuss staff.
10:00 am  We will meet discuss staff.  We need to have further meeting later with our staff to determine if we should offer other people jobs.  We have a lot of front office spots.  Slone, you need to get us a front office count by region.
 
I suggest that Hunter and Dave Ryan coordinate interviews for outside weather guys for next Monday.  We should bring in 10 if we can and hire 2 or 3.   I suggest Presto works with Gaskill and Will and the H guy I can't spell in Portland to put together gas and power fundies presentations for a week Tuesday.  I would like to have a clue before I start trading.
 
Hunter on the gas trading side I say we put all front office into 4 groups and give them a task to come up with the best Organization structure.   It will get everyone working.  We need that.  I would suggest that we start projecting our groups to death so they're focused on business.
 
I also suggest we put all the screens on the floor to commodity prices to keep people from watching Enron shit all day.
