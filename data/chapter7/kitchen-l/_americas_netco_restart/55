David has asked me to prepare the following 

1) Restart plan - as per your request
.

	
 

2) Employee briefing - pre deal execution communication - knowing as much as we know now and speculating to a certain extent on how some of the benefits/terms etc will be treated. This needs work on the business overview and business outlook but I see this as a "pre offer" sales pitch to employees to be followed up with another one the purchaser is known and then with the actual offer itself

 
Both are drafts
