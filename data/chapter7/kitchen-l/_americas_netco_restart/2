Louise,

Thanks so much for your speedy reply. I will pass your comments on to Dave Walker in Media Relations.

I included Kevin because he is listed with you, Greg and John on a "management" slide. If there are others who should be
included on Greg's core management team for the announcement, please let me know who they are and their titles. Please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include Kevin. If there is an org chart, that might be helpful, too. It would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long.

Thanks again,

Claudia

Just a couple of suggested changes to both.

There is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity.  Enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51% New Owner and 49% Enron.  We need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100% UBS owner.

(See attached file: UBSW Energy release draft.doc)
On the release for UBSWenergy.com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can, so I have removed
that sentence.
(See attached file: UBSenergycomreleasedraft.doc)
Do you need all of the commercial  MD titles or is Kevin picked out for a
particular reason?

Thanks

Louise

   Attached for your review are drafts of two news releases, one announcing
   the closing of the UBS Warburg / Energy
   transaction and the other to announce the launch of UBSWenergy.com. The
   plan is to issue the closing announcement on
   Friday (2/8) at about 8 a.m. New York time. The other is planned for
   when the website officially launches, which is
   expected on Monday (2/11).

   Please forward your comments directly to David P. Walker, head of Media
   Relations-Americas, sometime on Wednesday.

   Tomorrow, I will send you drafts of the internal announcements for
   Friday and Monday. The plan is to issue on Friday a
   global UBS Warburg email announcement from John Costas, announcing the
   new management. I need from Human Resources
   confirmed titles for Louise Kitchen, John Lavorato and Kevin Presto. In
   addition, we plan for Friday an email from Greg
   Whalley to employees who have signed on with UBS Warburg Energy, with
   Costas's announcement attached. (Both will also be
   posted on UBS Warburg intranets, including the integration site.) There
   will also be internal publicity on the day the
   website launches: another email from Whalley to Energy employees and
   intranet articles within UBS Warburg, including the
   integration site.

   Please let me know if you have questions.

   Thanks,

   Claudia
