UBSW Regional Security has coordinated the following access control
procedures with Enron Security.  We request that all visitors to
Enron-Houston complex follow this process.


1. Forward an email(before your departure)to Regional Security(Nikki
Canavan) requesting
access to Enron in Houston, Texas

2. Regional Security will authorize and forward these names to Enron
security.

3. UBS employees should go to main lobby reception desk at 1400 Smith
Street in the North Tower to obtain their temporary ID's.  UBS
employees should inform the receptionist/security officers that their
names have been forwarded to Enron security.  Enron
receptionist/security personnel will give the UBS employees a
temporary
access card to the building which will be valid for 24 hours only.
UBS
employees will be required to show a valid state(Drivers License) or
federal(passport) identification prior to the issuance of this
temporary ID card.

4. UBS employees intending to stay more than one day will then need
to call
Enron security at 713-646-6200 to arrange to have their photo taken

they will be issued an Enron access card. This card will be valid for
seven
business days.  If your visit to Enron will exceed 7 business days
