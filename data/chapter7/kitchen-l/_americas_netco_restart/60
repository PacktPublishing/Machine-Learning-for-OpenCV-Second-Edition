Louise, Attached please find our ERCOT business plan for your review.  Doug and I have jointly put together a trading/marketing detailed plan to get ERCOT restarted as quickly as possible.  We have separated the plan in three tiers to prioritize tasks and customers in order to expedite earnings for early 2002.  

One thing you should note is that in ERCOT we will not need a FERC power marketing license to start trading physical power due to Texas not being regulated by FERC.  Therefore if there is a drag on obtaining the FERC license, ERCOT should be in the lead for regions getting restarted.  

Let me know your thoughts.

Thanks, - Mike
