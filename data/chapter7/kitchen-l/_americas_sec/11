I'm not familiar with the individual assets (might include gaspart and ceg/rio) of that structure but the critical asset apparently is a $690mm loan to enron. When enron hit bbb- rating, rawhide was no longer allowed to lend to enron and called the note due. There was a rawhide bankers meeting late yesterday to consider enron's request to delay the call by several weeks. Neither bowen nor myself know if any decision has been reached by the lenders at this time.
