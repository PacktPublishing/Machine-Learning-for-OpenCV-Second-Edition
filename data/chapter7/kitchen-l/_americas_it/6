Attached is a report on all of the people who have posted messages to the Yahoo ENE stock discussion bulletin board between November 1 and November 20, 2001. At the top of the list is Clay Vernon, who we discussed yesterday, and who continues to post messages as "utlonghornsrule" today. Please note that not all of the comments made on the bulletin board have been negative, although it is still inappropriate for employees to be posting messages there. Please call me if you have any questions.
