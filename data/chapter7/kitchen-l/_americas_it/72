Attached are the notes from this week's  Gas Trading Vision - II status meeting and latest timeline for the project. 

Zhiyong called and asked me to review the notes and forward them to you in his absence.

In case you have not heard, he was involved in an accident this morning on his way to work. He was broad-sided pulling out of a parking lot. The impact ruptured a bone in his leg, and breaking glass hit the left side of his face. He is expecting to be out of the office for about two weeks during his recovery.  He is currently recovering at home and can be reached by phone and e-mail.

Please let me know if you have questions or need additional clarification after reviewing the notes.
