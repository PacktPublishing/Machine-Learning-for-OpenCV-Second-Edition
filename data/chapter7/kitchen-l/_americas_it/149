Dear Louise,

I am responsible for the Daily Position & Violation Reporting.  With the change in your role, I would like to set up a half hour with you to go over this reporting and find out from you if there are other things that you would like to see.

I will try and get something on your calendar this or next week.

Thanks

Shona
