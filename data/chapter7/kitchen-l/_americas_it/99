?	Gas Daily deals:
o	Revisions for changes to PortCalc application to create GDI calc in ERMS are in user test.
o	The development for the Curve shift reports has been completed.
o	Change CPR PortCalc to value outer month positions is in test.
?	Live feeds for Gas Daily/intra-month curves:
o	Released to production.
?	Saving different views in TDS:

Notes
?	Position roll-up process hangs sometimes in the production environment. This bug has been fixed in the parallel environment. The developer is now applying the fix to the production code.
?	The performance of loading curve to the position manager has been improved in the parallel environment. The same change will be applied to the production code.
?	We need to look into the current way of computing curve shift for Gas Daily options because it creates a large second order amount.
