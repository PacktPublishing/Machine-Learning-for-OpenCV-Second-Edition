Louise,

The wheels are in motion to update the iBuyit system per your request. Our expectation is to have the production environment updated by end of next week. We are working with Tammy Shepperd to draft a communication for your consideration in notifying your employees of the changes.

Thanks
John

Please alter authority levels for Enron Americas to the attached spreadsheet.

The problem is clear that these limits were done by Philippe which is a completely different working issue. << File: EWS Spend and Approval.xls >> 

Thanks

Louise

Louise:

Attached is the delegation of authority currently in effect for Wholesale Services/Americas that we discussed yesterday.  I have created a new column entitled Revised Spend Limit to facilitate changes.

Thanks again Louise for your support,

George
