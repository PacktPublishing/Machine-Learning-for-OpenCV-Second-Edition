Attached is a draft spreadsheet that captures the budget items reviewed with IT yesterday.

I have tried to correlate our description with their project name.  I have also created a starting budget and proposed budget for your review.  A % allocation row for east, west and cdn allocation has also been created for your review and comments.

The overall IT budget was brought down from 25.4MM to 16.3MM. 

Please review for any final comments as well as you comments on allocations.  Please note that the largest item was power fundamentals (6.2MM) which has bundled in it remote support, VMS support ect, it is IT's overall catch all accounts that require direct support of delivered  systems.
