?	Since Calgary office has not yet implemented the new GDI calc, there was a double counting issue with Canadian Gas Daily books last Friday, July 27. The IT team has been working closely with Calgary office to fix the problem as soon as possible.
?	In the last couple of weeks, a developer took a week and half off due to a family emergency and another developer took paternity leave for a week, which affected our project delivery timelines.
