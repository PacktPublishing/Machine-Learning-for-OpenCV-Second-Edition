Louise,

Zhi already signed his copy on Friday since he is now out of the country.  Could I have you sign this one?  If so, I can bring it by at your convenience.

Thanks, d.n.

Thank you for this revised version.  I have signed this copy and request that a fully signed document is completed by tomorrow.

Clearly the level of specification in this document is exceptionally high which may be the reason for the very extended timescales visible in this project.  I would expect detailed documentation on each of the components of the projects in time which look at addressing the current timescales and shortening them.

Thanks

Louise
