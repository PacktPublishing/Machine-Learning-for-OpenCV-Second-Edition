Louise,

I know you are very busy, but I'd to discuss with you, in person, how you think it's going with GTV II and a few other things.

I'll keep it short, say 10-15 minutes, some this week or early next week, (I'm out Friday).  I'm generally in by 7:30am and out by 7pm if that helps with your schedule?

regards

Steve
