Louise,

attached is a plan for the roll-out of Windows 2000 for the trading groups for which TIBCO 6.x has been scripted.

 
Richard Burchfield and I are currently investigating the state of TIBCO 5.x on the Windows NT 4.0 plaftorm that is still being used, and will get back to you when we have determined if the TIBCO 6.x solution can be incorprated into a script before the actual roll-out of Win2k.

regards

Steve

Plans for the week ending 4/20/01:
?	Continue IT development of Phase I items.
?	Obtain sign-off for GTV-II, Phase 2 issues and timeline.
?	Commence IT development of Phase 2 issues.

Issues:
Incompatibility of TIBCO version 5.x and 6.x. The single point of deal entry is done using TIBCO 6.x. Some users are still using TIBCO 5.x. Upgrading to either TIBCO 6.x or Windows 2000 is needed.
