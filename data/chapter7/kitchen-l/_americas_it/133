Louise,

Thank you for your suggestion. I agree that it is critical for us to get feedbacks from Geof as early as possible. For instance, Geof suggested some changes to the design last Friday. The suggestion requires some re-work on the user interface and some changes in the daily risk management process.

I love to have the team meet Geof daily. I will check with Geof for his availability.

Thanks

Zhiyong

I think we need to get a lot closer together - I expect Geoff (and the analyst working for Geoff on this) to be spending a lot more time down on the IT floors.  If we integrate at a much earlier stage we might not see any divergence from how Geoff sees the end result to what actually appears.

Could you consider how to get your team spending much more time with Geoff - I would suggest you have a daily time when you all (developers included) sit down around a desk to look at progress.

Let me know what you think?

Louise
