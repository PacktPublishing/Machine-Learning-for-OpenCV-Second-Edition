I love committees and this sounds like a real cracker.  See you there.

I can strongly recommend parenthood to you - good luck with yours, coming up soon I think?

Also, congrats on the new big role.  Great news.

Hello how are you?

I see we both got landed with this - having been on V&Vs before the appropriate word if definitely landed with this!

Hope you are enjoying fatherhood and that earnings pressure isn't getting to you!  It's that end of quarter feeling again.

See/speak to you on the conference call!

Louise
