Unfortunately to due a scheduling conflict, we will need to reschedule the Culture Committee presentation to Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling which had been scheduled for July 31.  Please let me know if your executive would be available to attend a meeting on Thursday, August 9 - 2:00-3:00 p.m.  

Thanks.
