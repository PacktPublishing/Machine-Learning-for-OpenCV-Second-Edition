Cindy,

In order to quantify some empirical deliverables to assess Enron's management capabilities of retaining top performers and removing lower tiered performers, this sub-committee has outlined the following assignments to be completed for EBS, ENA, ETS, Enron Europe and Enron Corp. by the May 14 meeting:

?	Using year-end PRC results, get the composition of the number of individuals per performance category, disaggregated between commercial and commercial support 
?	Assuming that these individuals are in the same PRC categories, assessment of the number of individuals retained per performance category as of May, 2001
?	For the employees that left a particular business unit, was the discharge involuntary or voluntary (left to another firm or another Enron business unit)

By gathering this empirical evidence, this Management Sub-committee can address the following questions :

?	How effective were Enron managers in removing lower tiered (Needs Improvement/Issues) employees?
?	Did lower tiered performers reallocate themselves to other business units (i.e.., reaffirming the myth that there is a subset of employees that exist "below the radar screen" and consistently job - hop)?
?	Have Enron managers successfully retained top performers from the 2000 PRC process?

Other questions that we would like to answer, but will be limited by existing PRC historical ratings are:

?	For those individuals rated Satisfactory and below, what have been their performance ratings in the past?
?	How many Superior or Excellent candidates have left over the past five years?

We wanted to send this email to highlight the need to acquire this PRC data quickly from our human relations representatives.  We wish to acquire the data in aggregate form, separated by performance category, work function (commercial vs. commercial support) and voluntary or involuntary egress from Enron.  The responsibility for acquiring this information by each Enron business unit is as follows :

?	ENA - Jean Mrha
?	ETS - Shelley Corman
?	EBS - Kelly Kimberly
?	Enron Europe - Richard Lewis
?	Enron Corp. - Gregory Adams

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Regards,

Jean
