Hello!

Just to update - we've extended the auction deadline to 7 August to give people more time to get comfortable with the contract on the back of Transco delaying their 6 month auctions.

We are still refining the curve analysis - so I'll get in touch when we've got it together.

Hope all is well with you - say hello to Marcus.

Hello!

Congratulations on your new arrival - hope you are all well.  Got married on 26 May and got sunshine in Dublin on the day!

We are running the virtual entry capacity as an auction
bids due in on 9 July (may be extended if Transco delay their auction)
5 year minimum term
any terminal
we have right to refuse gas at the beach on payment of compensation chosen by customer in the bid.

We are still running analysis to produce beach curves based but current thinking is that 
current market inefficiency is inflating the price (we are currently buying day ahead interruptible Fergus capacity at 0.3p and buying gas as it turns firm on the day at NBP-7p)
our aim is to take out the conservative guys in our auction so the Transco auctions should be less ridiculous (summer max price was 12p but the average was 6p, with wide spreads in each auction round
we have modelled with Transcost to verify Transco's view that Fergus can be expanded by 50% for 1 p/th LRMC

Also we have some other risk management angles we intend to pursue if we end up with a large position 
offer underwriting on incremental investment by Transco
code modifications to increase capacity auctioned
build a pipeline! 

It would be great to get your views on it - shall I give you a call when we've pulled together the curve analysis?

Peter

How are things with you?  Hope all is well - are you married now?

Just a quick one - you have scared me with the Entry Point trading thing.  If you ever want to talk it through give me a ring.
