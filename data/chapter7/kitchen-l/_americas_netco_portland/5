Steffes is looking for some direction on getting FERC license and pool agreements.  Among other things, he needs the go ahead from UBS and legal to start an application process for UBS while he is still employed by Enron.  When you have a moment, I might suggest a meeting with key legal, reg and commercial people so we know what we can do and when.  This is also relevant to transmission agreements and ultimately to customer agreements.
