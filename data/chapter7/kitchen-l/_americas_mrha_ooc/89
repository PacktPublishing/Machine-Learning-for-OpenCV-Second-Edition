Louise,

Per our discussion, you will find attached an itemized accounting (from expense reports) for the customer ski trip that Andrew Miles and John Kiani from my group attended (3/27/01-4/1/01) in Vail with two customers of Iroquois Pipeline who we have been working with to try and do a deal on their Eastchester Phase II Expansion.  As for the link on the www.skihomerental.com website, I am at a loss.  I have put a phone call into these people for an explanation and have asked for this link to be removed.  I can only assume that this was set up when we were talking to the internal client entertainment group about using the "Enron" Beaver Creek houses as the house descriptions look familiar.  We declined to use their services as a trip of this magnitude would have cost closer to at least $12,000 (for four people) and we decided to scope one out independently.  Please let me know if this answers your questions and if I can be of further assistance.

 

Thanks,
Chris Hilgert
