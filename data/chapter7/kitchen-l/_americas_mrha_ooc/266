Maroun Abboudy is working with Joe Defner on Fund Flow concepts but I am really
focusing more on trading deals we can do to bring in funds flow at a cost far lower
than the structured Global Finance deals we have done in the past.  Will keep
you posted.

John,

As promised please find attached the updated Capital Charge presentation for you to distribute to department heads.  I am still working on more examples to present.  I am considering the effect of the cost of capital curves in valuing option premia.  I will have to discuss with RAC.  I am setting up meetings with Risk management starting monday to see how we are going to implement the Charge in teh Book.  I will be trying to sit with yourself as well and discuss how you see the charge/benefit flowing through the different books.

We have also discussed the cost of capital concept with Joe Deffner from EGF-NA (they are working on a similar concept with Louise) and will be liaising weekly with them from Funds Flow pricing signals.
