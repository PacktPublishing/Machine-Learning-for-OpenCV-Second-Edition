I think the concern is around Scott Mills. He was brought down to accelerate the mid/back-office fixes for EES, primarily as it relates to system changes/improvements. We're bringing Anthony Dayao back from Japan to head up EES IT and he'll be leaning on Scott quite a bit I believe. 

How does your schedule look later today or tomorrow? I would like to sit down for a few minutes to discuss the status of the EOL products for EES/ENA and also to talk a little bit about some customer overlap between the two groups and how to handle it. I'll have Kay set up some time for us.
