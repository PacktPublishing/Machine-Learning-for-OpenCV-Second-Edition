Eric J. van der Walde, executive vice president of AEP Energy Services, announced that Gregory E. Wolfe has been hired as vice president marketing - west and will manage the new office. 

"We're locating in Portland because of its close proximity to the western energy markets," said van der Walde. "The new office will increase our presence in the western markets and enhance our ability to establish relationships with energy users in this important region." 

AEP currently conducts trading and marketing activities from offices in Columbus, Houston and London. Van der Walde noted that western trading activities would still be handled out of the company's Columbus location. 

Wolfe joins AEP from Enron Corp., where he served as vice president for marketing in Enron North America's Portland office. Wolfe joined Enron in 1993. He holds a bachelor of science degree in petroleum engineering from the Colorado School of Mines in Golden, Colo., and an MBA from the University of Texas at Austin. 

Initially, the Portland staff will include six to eight power marketers and gas marketers. "We're beginning conservatively and will adjust our staffing as needed," said Wolfe. The new office is located at the KOIN Center, Suite 1550, 222 SW Columbia St., Portland, Ore., 97201.
