No - but they are probably a good candidate for the restructuring group.   They were originally 9 barges that were owned by CALME (D. Haug) and were being shopped around Enron for a home.   Some of them went to a power project in Nigeria and now their are two of them left without a home.  

Last year they were being considered for a LIPA deal on Long Island that was orginally proposed by R. Maffett/R. Tapscott.  Janet D. was working on this deal before she left for EES - but I don't think she made any further progress.  As I recall the ownership of the barges came from the CALME organization into Mike McConnell's - EGM group as part of the split of CALME assets.
