FYI:  We found out how Jeff got nominated.  Paul Hobby, one of the group's Advisory board members, did it.

Karen,

Thanks so much; I will touch base with Greg before Saturday to provide him
with additional details and logistics.

Actually, one of our Advisory Board members at Genesis Park, Paul Hobby,
submitted his name as a nominee.  Obviously, Jeff is one of those leaders
that comes to everyone's mind when you think of the power of eCommerce and
the Internet!

We appreciate your support and will get you copies of photos from the event
as well as press coverage that is received.

Best regards,

Gary
