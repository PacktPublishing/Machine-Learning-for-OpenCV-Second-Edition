Just to ensure that I am supplying you with the correct information, by profit centers do you mean commercial teams? If so, we currently have 46- I took the count from our management summary (everything that falls into commercial, including structuring and fundamentals.) If this is not what you are looking for, please give me a ring and I'll be happy to pull whatever you need. Thanks! (I'm sorry I took so long get back with you- I've been tied up all afternoon.)

Back in 99 it went from 4 to 29 I am guessing it now has about 20.
