I received your message canceling Redmond and adding Clifford.
I also confirmed that Derek Davies is definitely not attending.
If we move Presto into the 3 bedroom condo with Davis and Dayao - it would open up a 2 bedroom.  Hopefully we can obtain another 2 bedroom and then cancel the 5 bedroom.
Your thoughts please.
Thanks.
