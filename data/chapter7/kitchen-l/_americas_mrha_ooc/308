Louise --

I've asked Margaret Carson to take a stab.  We have a meeting with DOE and Michael Miller this morning but will try and have something late afternoon.  Do you want to get together to go through our materials?

Jim

Jim,

Would someone in your group be able to put something together for me on the issues below (only about 2-3 pages),  Mark is speaking on several panels at the Natural Gas CEO summit in a week and the questions below are probably be best answered by you as I worry that we need to be consistent.  Could you get me something and I will combine it will the others.

I really need something by end of play Tuesday.

Thanks

Louise

Will natural gas continue to capture virtually all the growth or will coal make gains?
