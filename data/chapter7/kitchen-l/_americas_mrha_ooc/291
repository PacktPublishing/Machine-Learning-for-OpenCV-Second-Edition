To all,

I'm on board with Kieth's comments.  I just want to make sure we are all relaying the same message to the ENA organization - dotted/solid line... whatever.   Also, we are going to have to sell the resulting structure/processes/division of responsibility to the ENA origination teams so that we don't create unnecessary divisions.   This has been the case in the past - something we have all been working hard to avoid.

Regards,
Brian

Louise,

I left a message with Brian after receiving his phone message this morning, but have not had a chance to talk with him.  I have told no one solid or dotted line. In response to a direct question from Bruce Golden in Brian's group about what the reference to Development Engineers meant in the announcement, I told him Development Engineers were "connected" to EEOS as a part to technical quality control from a corporate perspective.  With others, Brian Stanley and I have used the concept that the Development Engineers are aligned to the Business Units but seconded from EEOS.  This allows movement to best satisfy corporate needs if required.  We felt this approach fits our none profit center aligned to Wholesale charter. As you state, we still have to work the details of our role in support of the Wholesale Business Units.

Aside, I have the least concerns with Brian's group. With Brian, we have a focal point to communicate above the day-to-day chatter and navigate over the hurdles left stacked with EE&CC baggage.

Brian Stanley is planning to spend a couple of weeks here sorting these types of issues.

Keith Dodson

Until there is another agreement between the three of you the message is:

The technical staff in Enron Americas will continue to report on a straight line to Brian who will work out the nature of his dotted line to the new group in the future.

Let's keep the business as usual, no change message to avoid any further miscommunications until you all sit down together.

Thanks

Louise
