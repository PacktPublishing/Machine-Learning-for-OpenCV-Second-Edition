I know this is a difficult time for Enron given the incident at Teeside, but I wanted to let you know that Principal Investments actually has an investment in a company called Serveron (www.serveron.com) which makes a product that monitors transformers for risk of failure.  This product/service may be a worthwhile investment at our facilities given the unfortunate accident of today and our desire for a superior safety record.

Regards,

Charlie
