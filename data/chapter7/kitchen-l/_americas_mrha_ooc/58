John, as a follow up to Greg's call, I would like to provide equity value, in recognition of the huge effort on the EES issues plus key player on the team going forward, to the following people from EES:

                                Options Equity          Total

        Rogers Herndon  $250K           $250K           $500K

        Don Black               $250K           $250K           $500K

        Jeff Richter            $100K           $100K           $200K

        Bernie Aucoin           $100K           $100K           $200K

        

I assume that you have Tim and Kevin managed.

Views?

When are we going to get back together to finalize our discussions?
