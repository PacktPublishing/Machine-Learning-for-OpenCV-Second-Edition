The Texaco/Havoline Grand Prix of Houston will take place downtown on October 5-7, 2001.  Enron has developed a relationship with the PacWest Racing Team, a member of the CART FedEx Championship Series featuring drivers Scott Dixon and Mauricio Gugelmin, which will enable us to offer our customers and executives a one of a kind hospitality package that will include the following features:

Gourmet hospitality including breakfast and lunch prepared for Enron guests by an on-site chef at the race track in PacWest's Summit (mobile hospitality and business suites)
Paddock passes allowing Enron guests to visit the garage areas where race car preparation takes place and providing a "behind the scenes" look at the business of motor sports
Sunday race event tickets located in Grandstand C, just before turn one and adjacent to the PacWest Summit
Special PacWest driver autograph and "meet and greet" sessions for Enron guests
Guided tours of PacWest's transporters and garage areas for Enron guests thereby providing a hands-on look at how the race cars are prepared for the weekend's on-track activities
Opportunity to network with companies that support PacWest including but not limited to: NEXTEL, JP Morgan Chase, Gemstar, Pennzoil, PPG, Tully's Coffee, Snap-On, Bosch, Freightliner, Toyota, Panasonic, 3D Village

I currently have the following tickets available for this event:
	Friday, October 5 - 4 Tickets
	Saturday, October 6 - 15 Tickets
	Sunday, October 7 - 20 Tickets
(No cost will be allocated back to Company and RC numbers)

Please let me know how many tickets you would like to reserve for this event by Tuesday, September 25.
On Wednesday, I would like to offer the remaining tickets to all Managing Directors and VPs within EA, EGM and EIM.  If there are specific individuals within your area that you would like to have this information distributed to, please advise.

Attached, please find the Program of Events and various pictures of the hospitality area.  Complete information on the race can be found at http://www.texacogp.com.
