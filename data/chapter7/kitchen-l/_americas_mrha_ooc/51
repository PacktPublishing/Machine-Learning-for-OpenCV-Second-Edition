Thanks, I really appreciate the feedback.  

In the narrative discussion accompanying the presentation we will articulate the timeframe.

The Rockies pre-build transaction refers to the Fountain Valley Project (PSCO taking MW's; Equity Flip to Black Hills).

We are still working on the Americas section of the conference call script.  I will forward to you as soon as it becomes available.

Kind Regards.

The only comment  on the structures transaction slide is that 

(i) They are not from this quarter 
(ii) the Rockies Power - prebuild, I am not entirely sure what this deal is - but there was one in Washington.
(iii) REmove MidWest Gas Utility Outsourcing as we haven't completed this yet - hopefully you can have it for Q4.
(iv) Price Risk Management is your call - its really just trading.

Please find the latest draft of the Wholesale pitch included below as an attachment.

I have included front portion, Americas and Europe sections.

The only data point I am lacking at this point relates to our East Power slide regarding #  of Term MW's.  I am working with Leslie Reeves on obtaining this information.  I expect the wording on the RTO's slide may change a bit once Gov. Affairs provides their final comments; however, this draft includes most of the content.

Following our discussion this morning, you may have some comments on Slide 14 (Recent Structured Transactions).  This slide was modeled after your Board presentation.  We can add/delete information as you desire.  

I am working on modifying the conference call script language and will forward to you shortly.

Thanks again for your help.

Regards.
