Louise - On April 10, our analysts at Merril Lynch (Donato Eassey and Carl Kirst) are hosting an evening with senior mgmt. of energy merchants for 25 of their top insitutional clients.  The event will be at South Shore Harbor.  We have arranged this on your calendar to participate as the senior Enron rep.  Other energy attendees we know of at this point include:

El Paso 	Clark Smith
Dynegy  	Mat Shoutsman
Williams  	Bill Hobbs
Duke  		____ Kelly
Enron  		You

I do not have a specific agenda or client list yet - will send as soon as available.  
 
Starting mid afternoon (time to be confirmed - likely between 2 and 2:30), Merrill will set up 5 separate conference rooms with a company in each conference room.  They will rotate 5 clients from room to room every 20 minutes to 1/2 hour to meet with each company executive and IR person.    They would like each company to put together no more than 5 slides with their strategy, focusing on distinctions.  The sessions will be informal, allowing the firms to ask specific company-related questions.

Donato has been a long-time sailor and has a 50+ foot boat.  At 5:00 p.m. they will take the boat to The Aquarium (you can also drive to the Aquarium - 10 mins.).  Dinner will be at 6:00 and this should be done by 8:00 p.m.  At that time they will board the boat again back to South Shore Harbor.  Whoever decided to drive to dinner can leave at that time (might be a reasonable alternative for someone in late stage pregnancy!).

We don't often ask mgmt. to give up an evening when in Houston, but this event is important to Merrill.  I expect the to 25 firms represented to be worthwhile.  I very much appreciate your availability - will be in touch with more specifics.  

Thanks, Paula
