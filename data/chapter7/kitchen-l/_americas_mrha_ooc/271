Louise,

These are some of the details Selden and I have talked about.  Also, I'll be sending the contact list to e/o involved from Enron on the day (Mark, you, Ian, and myself).  Selden also made a few points that I'll discuss with you tomorrow.  He also suggested that you and he talk tomorrow PM.

FYI - I'm taking in the Fed-Ex shipment now.  Also, we got the EnronOnline folders - you were right (again).  Torrey has finished his analysis and we can discuss those with you whenever you have time.

- R
