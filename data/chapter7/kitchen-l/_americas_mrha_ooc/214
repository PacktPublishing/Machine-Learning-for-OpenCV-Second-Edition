Thanks got a copy of several presentations. Looks like morale is pretty down in the US and London and the picture is looking too bright for the next six months.
Things are going well on this side of the world as we stay on track for our targets this year.  Brought in two originators, Rob Stewart from project Dolphin, and Martin Webb, who was in the UK office before going to Spain, to help build a more physical profile in the market.  Working on making Australia a good news story for growth and see the potential for some large global products deals - just got to convert potential to $$$.

See you sometime in Q3.

Cheers

Paul
