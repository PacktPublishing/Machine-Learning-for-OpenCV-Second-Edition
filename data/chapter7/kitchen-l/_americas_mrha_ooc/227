Subject:	NGX et al Litigation Settlement - Press Release

The following message is to go to everyone in Calgary and Toronto ASAP.

We have settled our lawsuit with NGX, Canadian Enerdata, OM Gruppen and Richard Zarzeczny, regarding the compilation and methodology for calculating the Alberta natural gas price indices published by the Canadian Gas Price Reporter.  By the terms of the settlement there will be a joint press release issued this morning regarding the settlement, which is to be the only public communication regarding the matter unless agreed to by all parties.  A copy of the press release is attached below.  Otherwise the settlement is confidential to the parties.  Accordingly, there is to be no formal or informal discussion with media, colleagues, competitors, counterparties or otherwise.  If you receive  request, simply reply that you understand that the matter is confidential, but the request can be referred either to Rob Milnthorp or me and we will respond as appropriate.

If you have any questions, please speak to Rob or me.

Peter Keohane.
