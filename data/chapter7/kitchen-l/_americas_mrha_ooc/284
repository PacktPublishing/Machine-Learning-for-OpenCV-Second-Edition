Good Morning Louise!

Here is the first draft of the article for the ENSIDE Newsletter.  Please read and make any changes or corrections and send it back to me.
Let me know if there is anything I can do to help you. 

 Also, what did you decide about the photo opportunity?  My photographer promises to give you several options for posing - behind your desk!

Please let me know and I will schedule him at your convenience.

Best regards,
Kathie Grabstald
