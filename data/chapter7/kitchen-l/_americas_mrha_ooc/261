Rahil -- Many thanks for the note. Larry Selden and I will be working on

Geoff,

It was nice meeting and chatting with you (albeit briefly) about
EnronOnline and other markets in which Enron participates (not to
mention our li'l chat about English clothes  :-)

Just wanted to send you a note reiterating the offer to answer any
questions you may have regarding EnronOnline or Enron.  Having gone
through the development process of EnronOnline and some of the other
initiatives within Enron,  Louise and/or I should be able to provide you
with insights in case you have questions.

Regards,
Rahil
