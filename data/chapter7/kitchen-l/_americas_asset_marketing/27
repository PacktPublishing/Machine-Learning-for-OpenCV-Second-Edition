We have a $1MM deductible.  We also have BI that will kick-in after 30 days (won't help much).  Stuart spoke to Jody and Wes, and they are looking for the right home for the charge.  But to answer your question, yes, it will hit income (the joys of owning and running an asset)!  Kevin has basically told the hourly desk, no more running.
