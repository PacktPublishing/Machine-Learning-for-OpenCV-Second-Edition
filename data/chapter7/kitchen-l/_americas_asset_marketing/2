Louise,

Maybe you were able to get a 2001 bonus payment for Stuart Zisman and just can't tell me, but if not, I would appreciate anything and everything that you can do.  I know Stuart is very well respected outside of this company, and will leave if things become uncertain.  While I would hate to lose anyone on the team, I would especially hate to lose him.  

Good luck with things this weekend, and let me know if I can do anything (713-412-8967).

Thanks,

Don
