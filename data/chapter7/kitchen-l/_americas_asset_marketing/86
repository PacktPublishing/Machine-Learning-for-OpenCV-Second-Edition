Attached is the Press Release announcing the completion of Cinergy's acquisition of Enron's Brownsville, TN and Caledonia, MS generating facilities. Basically, it is just a reiteration of the Press Release issued in December announcing the acquisition. The release has been approved by Enron Corp IR and PR and will be issued this afternoon. 

Please call me with any questions.
