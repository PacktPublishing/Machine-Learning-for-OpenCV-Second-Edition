Pat,

On Thursday, May 3rd, Enron will receive two wire transfers from Supply.
They will be in the amount of $600,000,000 and $447,700,445. The wires will
be coming from PNC Bank, Allegheny Energy Supply Company account number
1008969371.  I believe someone in Enron's Treasury department was looking
for this information.  Please let me know if you need any further additional
information.

Dan
