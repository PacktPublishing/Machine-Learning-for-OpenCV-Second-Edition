Brian,

I know you probably have your hands full with our tragedy in the UK.  However, following up to our conversation last week, I have spoken with these guys a couple of times and they would like to visit with you about some type of JV/outsourcing deal.  Please see the email below.  If you will let me know your schedule, I will attempt to set something up.

Regards,

Don

		Don:   Thanks for you quick and professional follow up to my
confidential request about whether Enron's EEOS Group might be available for
some form of business combination.  I have notified Mr. Joseph P. Lahey, my
client with the Lahey Group, of your response.  He has requested that I ask
you to ask Mr.Stanley if we could meet anyway,  some time during late August
or early September, in that we might like to discuss a possible joint
venture between Lahey Group and Enron EEOS, whereby Enron EEOS would
fullfill certain aspects of Lahey Group domestic projects.  Once again
thanks for your assistance in advance.  Cliff McFarland, President,
