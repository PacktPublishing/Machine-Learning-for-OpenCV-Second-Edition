Louise,

I spoke with Victor yesterday and he said that the numbers we saw in our Cogentrix meeting reflect our standard QF valuation methodology including a residual value of $250 kW, grown at 2.5% until the end of the contracted period.  I had him do a sensitivity analysis by dropping the value to $100 kW and it only had a $50 million impact. 

Let me know if you have any additional thoughts.

Don
