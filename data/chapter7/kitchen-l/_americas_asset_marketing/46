I will be circulating in the next few minutes a revised New Albany Analysis.  The only revisions that were made were to correct: (1) the cost basis (as of 3/31/01), (2) the monthly depreciation amount (which actually diverges from the budgeted amount) and (3) the spare parts basis.  I have double checked with Cris Sherman and Theresa Vos and they are in agreement with these numbers.  The total impact of these changes is a reduction to the PV Margin of $2,316,000.  I apologize for the mistake but hope that you understand that the mistake arose from errors in the information that was supplied to me.  

Stuart
