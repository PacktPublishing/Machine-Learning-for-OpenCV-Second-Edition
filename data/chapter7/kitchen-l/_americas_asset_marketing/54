Attached is the FINAL version of the Allegheny Press Release that will be issued later today once the deal is officially closed. Please note that the price ($1.028 billion) will NOT be included in the release. I spoke with Allegheny and they agreed that it was not necessary to disclose the price. Other than deleting the price, no other changes have been made to this final version of the release. 

Please let me know if you have any questions.  I really appreciate all your help in moving so quickly on the approval process. 

Thanks,
Jennifer Walker
