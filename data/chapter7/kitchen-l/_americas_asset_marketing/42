Regarding the attached email, Don asked me to relay the following response.  First, it is relatively unlikely that the IDB will conclude that their approval is not necessary (according to Maria Elena the need for IDB consent is unambiguous).  Second, even if the IDB suggests that their approval is not necessary, there is another material condition precedent, CFC consent.  The CFC is the Mexican equivalent of the Federal Trade Commission in the United States and consent from the CFC is not expected for forty five days after filing (filing is anticipated for June 29, 2001).  Maria Elena is currently visiting with Cris Sherman to discuss our ability to book income given these two items and will get back with you shortly.  Please feel free to call with anything further.

Stuart

If IDB comes back today and says that the board of IDB does not need to approve this sale to Tractebel, they will probably still need to see docs etc.  BUT can we book it (this quarter?)
