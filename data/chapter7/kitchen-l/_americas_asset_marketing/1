Jeff,

As we discussed, attached is a comprehensive list of the team and deals. As you know, Louise formally calls our team Asset Marketing. I tend to think that we play a number of roles including corporate development, CTG, deal structuring, and anything else that is required to get a deal done. 

In addition to the core team, I believe we also need to consider other issues related to asset sales including DealBench ("DB").  DB is a tremendous platform, that should be maintained.  It facilitates the sales process in so many ways, and would require very little to keep it alive.  Jon Hoff in our group can do almost anything related to DB and would probably require one engineer (not 100% of his time) to be available for DB to maintained.  

In addition to our team, the development group run by Ben Jacoby has been selling development sites, and Chris Calger has a team out west that has had a lot of success.  These groups (or a subset thereof), I believe should be maintained for the assets that they hold today and potentially other sales as well. 

Lastly, the asset sales that we are pursuing or have completed reflect a true team effort.  There has been and remains a core group of people that embrace every asset sale that we do.  People like Mike J. Miller, Mitch Robinson, and Ross Newlin contribute in many ways, and are great people to have around in discussing various issues including technical and operating issues.  Mitch and Ross have been to almost every plant in the Enron portfolio.  While it is true that we have technical people in Brazil or wherever, the question is whether they are capable and competent, and can they sell in front of a counterparty?  Additionally, most of the plants that we built were designed and managed from Houston.  In addition to these guys, as you well know, asset sales take people from tax, insurance, environmental permitting, etc.  We need to make sure these type of people are around, otherwise we end up with no incumbent knowledge base (I am sure you recognize all of this).

Sorry for the long email and I hope this helps.

Don
