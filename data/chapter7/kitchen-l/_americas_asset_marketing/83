Ben,

I have heard through the grape vine that concerns were raised this morning at your staff meeting about the Allegheny closing.  Just to clarify, we have set May 3, 2001 as the closing date.  On that date we should receive $1,028,000.00 plus $10-15 million for reimbursement of some cost associated with a build out of a sub station. 

Let me know if you have any other questions.

Regards,

Don
