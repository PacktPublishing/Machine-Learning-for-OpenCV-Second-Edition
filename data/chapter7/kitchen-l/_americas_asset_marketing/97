Louise,

Just spoke to Mike Morell.  Seems to be a little more relaxed today.  As is attached below, they have filed the S-3 for their equity offering.  GOOD NEWS!

Will let you know when I hear from Delainey.

Thanks,

Don

Looks like Allegheny may have filed their S-3.  We might know whether we have a deal on Wednesday.
