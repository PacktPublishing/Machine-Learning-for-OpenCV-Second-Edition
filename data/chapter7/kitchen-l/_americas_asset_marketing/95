Dave,

Quick update.

It appears Art is on vacation all week.  He is obviously not too concerned about the issue.  I am still waiting to hear back from David Tang to see if they want one of their guys to go to the plant tomorrow.  

We could/should get FERC approval any day.  This is the last real CP for this deal.

Let me know if you and Cyrus hook up.

Thanks,

Don
