This email is intended to serve as an update to the closing schedule for the sale to Tractebel of an 80% interest in Enron's Monterrey Project. 

The closing schedule is as follows:

Wednesday, October 17, 2001 - Preclosing (getting all the documents required for closing in order).
Thursday, October 18, 2001 - Finalize Preclosing
Friday, October 19, 2001 - Money changes hands, and we transfer 80% of our interest to Tractebel.

As such, unless otherwise notified, please assume that as of Friday, October 17, our ownership in the Monterrey Project will drop to 20%.  There will be a transition period with Tractebel following closing.  If you are unsure how this sale will impact your daily routine as it relates to this project, please contact either Steve Irvin or me.  

Important Reminder

We last met on September 21, 2001 to go through the reps, warranties and covenants (and related schedules) that Enron is providing at closing.  If anyone is aware of any update or change that should be made to those schedules such that all our reps, warranties and covenants are all still true and correct in all material respects, please let me know immediately.  A copy of the reps, key covenants, and schedules is provided below.  Please review and let me know of any changes today.

Thanks again for everyone's help over the past five months as we have pushed this transaction towards closure. It has truly been a team effort.
