Dave,

Just wanted to give you the a quick update on TIL.  GE is coming out to install Rev4 on Monday (see details below).  

As we discussed earlier today, Rev2 was installed at Caledonia in December, soon after signing PSA with Cinergy.  Rev4 is now out and available.  If we decide to run, we need Rev4.  GE called today to say that the tech is coming to Caledonia on Monday to install Rev4 (or if we delay, it will be two weeks).  Obviously we can't wait two weeks.  As required in the PSA, I called Cinergy (David Tang) to tell him that we are installing Rev4 on Monday and Tuesday and if they want to send someone to the plant to witness the control curve changes, to send someone out on Tuesday (GE's recommendation).  We will also have Ross Newlin from OEC at the plant.

In addition, we confirmed with Michelle April (GE Rep) today that we are still operating under the original TIL issued back in December (which you have a copy of).

Let me know if you need anything else.

Don
