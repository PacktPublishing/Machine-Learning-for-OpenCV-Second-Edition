Louise there are a lot of issues which will add to the costs of acquiring the applications.  The collection of all of the offers, awards and the historical database should have value to us.  If we decide that the value is there then we would be looking at additional expenses to have SSI continue to host and operate the applications for up to a year until we could rewrite portions of it and absorb it in house.  This acquisition would buy us time and give us a jump start in developing our capacity trading tools but we also need to be aware that there will be additional costs going forward and potentially some issues with maintenance of the data feeds from the pipes if we don't finalize TPA's with all of the pipes.  -  Tommy
