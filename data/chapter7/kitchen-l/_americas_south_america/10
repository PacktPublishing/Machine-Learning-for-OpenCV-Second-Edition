Our Copel shares are falling in value.  We have never marked this investment even though it is public.  We currently own ADR's - ELP is the ticker.  We are restricted (i think) in selling until July.  At the current price we would lose 15 to 30 Million.

Copel is trading at $6.70, down over $1.00 from Thursday close. The rumor is that this is the aftershock of a 7 MM block trade last week.
