We prepared a presentaton on Argentina and Brazil for your SP trip.  Michae=
l Guerriero said that we should add you to our e-mail list.  John Lavorato =
and Jim Hughes have already been added.  I am the Director of the Sovereign=
 Risk and Foreign Exchange Group within Enron Research under Vince Kaminski=
.

A few weeks ago Gary Hickerson asked me to send information to Kevin Hannon=
 on Argentina, Brazil, India. Korea, Turkey and the UK.  We've sent excerpt=
s from past Global Markets Monitors (GMM) published by Maureen Raymond Cast=
aneda and Gwyn Koepke from Enron Research Department.  I thought it would b=
e helpful to add you to the list of recepients of this weekly publication.

Please find attached the two most recent issues of the GMM.   The purpose o=
f this product is to inform the traders as well as various business units a=
cross the corporation on important international economic events and their =
impact on currency and financial markets.  Special emphasis is placed on po=
tential central bank policy changes and the impact these changes have on in=
terest rates and currencies.  We also emphasize emerging markets countries =
such as Argentina, Brazil, India, Korea, and Turkey.  We select countries t=
hat have relevant news, a credit rating change or are in the midst of an ec=
onomic or financial crisis.

Past issues can be located on our website address http://enaresearch.corp.e=
nron.com/research/framework/default.asp
We also attached for your convience previous GMM articles from Jan. 2000-Au=
g. 10, 2001 for Brazil and Argentina.  Also attched is an internally distri=
buted e-mail outlining the risks of default and devaluation in Argentina.  =
And finally the assumptions behind the Brazil curve.

If you have any question regarding Argentina or Brazil or any other countri=
es in which Enron has assets, our group can help.  I can be reached at X3-0=
396 in Houston.

Subject:=09ENA Research: Argentina default and devaluation risk rises.  Bra=
zil feels the effects of the contagion=20

Date: 12 July 2001

From: Maureen Raymond-Castaneda
         Gwyn Koepke

We believe that the risk of an Argentine debt default has increased and pes=
o devaluation risk has also risen substantially in the last several days.

Due to recent economic and fiscal developments in Argentina, we believe:

Argentina lacks the fiscal and monetary maneuverability to lift itself out =
of a 3-year recession (exacerbated by a global slowdown) and a strong peso.=
  Argentina's fiscal position has weakened substantially due to economic we=
akness that limits government revenue receipts needed to balance the fiscal=
 deficit and pay off the country's debt service.  A loss of investor confid=
ence has caused spreads to widen despite Argentina's need to rollover about=
 $8bn of short-term Letes (Argentine government debt) by the end of the yea=
r.  Yields paid at this week's Treasury auction are at levels that are not =
sustainable over the medium-term.  Three-month Treasury yields are 14.01% (=
versus 9.1% paid at auction on June 26 and 7.89% on June 12).  In addition =
to suffering from widening yields, Argentina was forced to shorten the teno=
r of debt from a mix of 6-month and 1-year bonds issued previously to only =
3-month securities at this week's auction due to increased risk aversion to=
 longer-term government paper by local investors (pension funds and banks).=
  The sharp increase in Letes yields, and the inability to issue longer mat=
urities, is highly indicative of the difficulty the Argentine government wi=
ll have in rolling over $8bn in short-term paper over the remainder of the =
year at sustainable rates, which further weakens its fiscal position due to=
 higher interest payments. =20
The recession has been exacerbated by the strong peso caused by the persist=
ently strong US dollar, which has hurt Argentina's export competitiveness e=
specially vis-a-vis the Brazilian real that has depreciated about 25% relat=
ive to the USD since the beginning of the year.  As a result to these facto=
rs, we believe the risks of Argentine debt default and peso devaluation are=
 mounting. =20
Argentina is increasingly vulnerable to a run on the banking system.  Argen=
tines are switching from peso to dollar deposits.  Argentina's limited fore=
x reserves constrain the central bank's ability to support the peso, if pri=
vate sector deposits are withdrawn or converted into U.S. dollars.  Private=
 sector deposits of $74bn are 33% peso-denominated, or $25bn, and 67% are f=
oreign currency-denominated deposits, which dwarf Argentina's official fore=
x reserves of $25bn.  Total private sector deposits fell about $5bn (from $=
77.5bn to $72.4bn) between February and end-April this year before stabiliz=
ing at $74bn as of July 6th.  =20
Political uncertainty is very high and throws into serious doubt Economic M=
inister Cavallo's ability to win opposition support for a new fiscal auster=
ity program announced late yesterday.  Cavallo needs to win approval for hi=
s fiscal agenda not only at the national level, but also at the provincial =
level, which will not be easy considering the 3-year contraction.  Failure =
to gain this support to cutback spending will worsen Argentina's fiscal woe=
s, and cause a further deterioration of investor confidence.
These external and internal pressures leave the exchange rate vulnerable to=
 speculative attack and threaten the 1-to-1 dollar peg, especially in light=
 of the country's limited foreign exchange reserves.  Today, Argentina's 1-=
month NDF traded at P1.15, implying risk of a 15% devaluation, while yester=
day, the 1-month NDF traded at P1.05 (implying an increased probability of =
devaluation since yesterday).  Also today, the 1-year NDF traded at 1.25, i=
mplying a 25% devaluation.  As a result of these above internal and externa=
l pressures, we believe the risk of peso devaluation has increased substant=
ially.
The danger of a steep devaluation is that private sector firms that hold do=
llar-denominated debt and are long pesos and short dollars will suffer from=
 sharply higher debt payments.  This could cripple an already tenuous econo=
mic situation by causing a further deterioration in government revenue thro=
ugh lower tax receipts.

Developments in Argentina impact Brazil through 3 main channels:

Currency Volatility: Contagion from Argentina has lead to a substantially w=
eaker Brazilian real.  Triggered by a general sell off of Argentine stocks,=
 bonds and currency, the real has depreciated 24% since the beginning of th=
e year to close today at R2.55.  To stem the real's recent decline, central=
 bank President Fraga hiked interest rates 150 bp and simultaneously interv=
ened in the forex market June 22, which stemmed the real's depreciation for=
 about one week (see GMM, 29 June).  Recent currency volatility could resul=
t in further central bank intervention by drawing on Brazil's forex reserve=
s.  Fraga has indicated the central bank will intervene to support the real=
's value.  A weak real will also translate into higher inflation expectatio=
ns in Brazil.
Emerging market credit spreads: Argentina represents about 25% of total eme=
rging market debt traded.  Current investor concern about Argentina has con=
sequently widened emerging market debt spreads.  Wider spreads put upward p=
ressure on overnight rates in Brazil, reducing liquidity and increasing cos=
ts of debt service in Brazil.
Trade mechanism: Further downward pressure on economic output in Brazil (al=
ready aggravated by the drought-induced energy crisis) brought on by weaker=
 export market growth to Argentina.  Also, the weaker Argentine peso would =
reduce Brazil's export competitiveness within the Mercosur trade bloc.

This week's GMM will contain more details on the contagion effects on Brazi=
l as well as Argentina's disappointing Treasury bill auction, the trend in =
private sector deposits, Cavallo's new fiscal measures to cut spending, Arg=
entina's heightened political risk associated with the need for fiscal aust=
erity amid concerns over provincial political support and S&P's debt downgr=
ade to "B-", which is one notch below Moody's rating of "B2".=20
