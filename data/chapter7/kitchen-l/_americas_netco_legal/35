Louise:

As per my voice mail and last e-mail, I would very much like to discuss this issue with you.  

But just in case we are not able to discuss this issue today, I wanted to make sure that you have the GTCs.  Thus, attached below please find the GTC with and without credit as you have requested.

Leslie

I am thoroughly confused - we are not putting the master on line.  Where is the short form GTC?  Please provide short form GTC today -  thanks.

Louise:

Attached please find the GTCs for power (with and without credit).  Please note that we are actually using the EEI Master Agreement as the on-line contract, as opposed to the traditional GTCs.  We were actually in the process of making this transition on EOL this fall, and Kevin Presto and Tim Belden have endorsed Netco's use of the EEI on-line.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Leslie
