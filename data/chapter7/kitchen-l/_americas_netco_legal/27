The goal is to finalize the GTCs and all significant trading forms and receive UBS Warburg comments and sign-off by both legal and credit by the end of business on Friday.  To that end, Bryan Murtagh and Sanjev [Credit] are coming down to Houston tomorrow evening for meetings in EB 38C2 starting at 9:00 am on Thursday and 1:00 pm on Friday.  This timing is important in the overall rollout plan.  Peter Keohane is also coming to Houston for the meetings to make parallel changes to the Canadian forms.  

Generally, the plan is to finish the Financial GTCs, the ISDA Schedule and Collateral Support Agreement Paragraph 13 first on Thursday.  Next, we should go to the Physical Gas GTCs, the Enfolio Master and the Adoption Agreement.  Finally, we should proceed to the EEI Master and Collateral Annex.  Also, there should be a discussion of the WSPP and any other Western related issues.

On a separate track, all gas transportation and related gas agreements (most of which are non-negotiable) are being prepared by Suzanne Calcagno, Jeff Hodge, Gerald Nemec and Angela Davis.  These agreements will also require sign-off by legal and credit.  A discussion should be scheduled on Thursday or Friday.  On the power side, ERCOT issues should be discussed, but otherwise the discussion of transmission agreements etc. can wait until next week.  

Please identify all critical path issues to achieve the above-stated goal.  Thanks in advance for all the hard work!
