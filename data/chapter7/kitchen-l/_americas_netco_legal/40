Louise:

I am happy to provide you with the short form GTC today.  However, I believe that an on-line EEI will receive quicker market acceptance than the GTCs and that as a result more counterparties will start trading on-line in a shorter period of time. 

I have attached below a revised version of the on-line EEI for your consideration.

The on-line EEI is a very long document, I agree.  But there are now only 2 pages of Netco changes to the EEI that our counterparties will have to review, as opposed to 8 two column pages of GTCs.  (I have spoken with Elizabeth about how best to ensure quick acceptance of the on-line documentation, and we decided to cut our other changes to the EEI down to the bare bones.)  The EEI is a widely accepted power contract, and I believe that a large number of our counterparties will prefer to trade pursuant to an on-line EEI over a GTC.  (fyi, EPMI has 98 executed EEI contracts.)

Please call me so that we can discuss.  I'd really like a chance to convince you that the EEI is the way to go before we launch with the GTCs.

Thanks,

Leslie

I am thoroughly confused - we are not putting the master on line.  Where is the short form GTC?  Please provide short form GTC today -  thanks.

Louise:

Attached please find the GTCs for power (with and without credit).  Please note that we are actually using the EEI Master Agreement as the on-line contract, as opposed to the traditional GTCs.  We were actually in the process of making this transition on EOL this fall, and Kevin Presto and Tim Belden have endorsed Netco's use of the EEI on-line.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Leslie
