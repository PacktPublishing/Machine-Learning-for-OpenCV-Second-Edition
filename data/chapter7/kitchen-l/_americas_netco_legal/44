I have given Mark Taylor my comments on the financial forms and he will be revising them.  I have met with Van Hooser and Hodge to discuss gas and have spoken with Bradford to get his perspective on gas.  We will be narrowing the menu of forms, revising in respect of certain terms, and studying possible construct changes to assist in credit matters.  Mark mentioned next Tuesday as a target which I will try to meet.  The EOL forms will be completed first.  Any questions, call me.
