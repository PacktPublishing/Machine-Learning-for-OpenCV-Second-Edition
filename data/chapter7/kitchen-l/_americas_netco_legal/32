I attach the following:

1.	Online Firm Gas GTC for NETCO with credit support:

	 ; and

2.	Online Firm Gas GTC for NETCO without credit support:

	 .

As with all our forms, these have changes from the U.S. forms to reflect local laws, industry practice and contracting policies.

I also attach each of these forms as blacklined to the corresponding U.S. form:

	 	 

These new forms are in the new legal database that has been created for NETCO.

My next tasks will be to prepare the following, in the following order of priority:

1.	Online Financial GTC for NETCO with credit support;
2.	Online Financial GTC for NETCO without credit support;
3.	Online Firm Power GTC for NETCO with credit support;
4.	Online Firm Power GTC for NETCO without credit support; and
5.	Offline/Telephone forms of GTCs for each of these products.

We will then focus on updating our Master Agreements for gas, power and financial.

Regards,
Peter
