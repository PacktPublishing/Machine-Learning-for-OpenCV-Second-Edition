We are making progress, but it is slow.  Below are listed the contracts or terms on which we need sign off from UBS Warburg.  I telephoned Brian Murtagh today and asked him to come down this week to Houston to help finalize all the forms by the end of the week.  He is coming on Thursday.  We also talked about getting sign off from tax and credit at the same time, so as not to delay things.  He is hopeful that no sign off will be required from Switzerland (re the bank netting issue) at least on an interim basis.

In regard to the counterparties we are going to focus on first -- I need a further prioritization of the list with approximately 160 counterparties that I believe you had prepared.  I think I need the top 50, the second 50 and so on.

I will be out on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday for my operations.  

Regards,

Mark Haedicke
