POWER POINTS: Enron Exit From Energy Markets Gets Messy

A Dow Jones Newswires Column=20

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Despite assurances from many companies that the remo=
val of Enron Corp. (ENE) from North American energy markets was proceeding =
in an orderly fashion, Enron havoc broke loose Friday morning.
Cleaning up the mess will be nearly unbearable for energy industry employee=
s for a few weeks because Enron was involved in so many trades. But industr=
y workers don't expect electric reliability to be threatened or gas supplie=
s to be disrupted. What's more, the free market's ability to resolve proble=
ms most efficiently and to keep infrastructure humming will shine.=20
The lull after Wednesday morning's collapse of Dynegy Inc.'s (DYN) acquisit=
ion of Enron was deceptive. On Thursday afternoon, Mirant (MIR) told Enron =
it would make no more power and gas deliveries to the company starting Satu=
rday, the first day of the new month. A couple of other companies followed =
suit by Friday morning.=20
Enron in turn began to lose its ability to meet its obligations as a suppli=
er, because it doesn't produce much electricity. To meet sales obligations,=
 it buys from producers and other traders. The positive feedback system is =
expected to spiral upwards until early next week, when Enron could be almos=
t totally out of the energy market.=20
To get an idea of how messy this all is, look at one troubled transaction T=
hursday for Saturday delivery of electricity to a utility. The utility boug=
ht power from Sempra Energy (SRE), which had bought it from El Paso (EPG), =
which bought from Dynegy (DYN), which bought from PG&E (PCG), which bought =
from Aquila (ILA), which bought from El Paso subsidiary Engage, which bough=
t from Enron, which bought from Mirant, which bought from British Columbia'=
s BC Hydro, which bought from TransAlta (T.TA), which will generate the pow=
er Saturday from its Centralia power plant in Washington state. TransAlta p=
robably sold the power over a year ago.=20
Mirant Balks=20

In physical contracts for energy, a daisy chain that long isn't unusual. An=
d, unlike oil and natural gas markets, power markets still primarily trade =
contracts for physical delivery, rather than financial hedges.=20
Trouble arose on the particular transaction because Mirant decided on Thurs=
day that it would no longer perform under its obligations to Enron. Mirant =
figured, reasonably, that its chances of getting paid for any current deliv=
eries aren't great. Fortunately, Silicon Valley Power, which is the municip=
al utility of the City of Santa Clara, Calif., stepped in between Mirant an=
d Enron, so that power will flow.=20
Under industry rules, the end-use utility must know all of the intermediary=
 owners as a matter of reliability, so that if any kinks arise in the chain=
 utility operators know whom to call. Also, if some force majeure like a tr=
ansmission line outage, prevents all of the electricity under contract from=
 being delivered, the utility has to notify all the previous owners to pay =
whomever they bought from for only what was ultimately delivered.=20
Why, one might ask, didn't participants just take Enron out of the chain? M=
irant could have just sold to Engage, the company Enron had sold to.=20
Unfortunately, removing Enron from the industry wont' be that easy. Forward=
 prices for natural gas everywhere in North America and for bulk power in t=
he western U.S. plummeted through most of this year. The market value of th=
at Centralia power plant's December output was about $250 a megawatt-hour t=
his spring. It's worth about $29/MWh in today's market. For just one standa=
rd 25-MW monthly contract, that's a loss in value of about $2 million.=20
Most likely, Mirant sold to Enron at a higher price than Enron sold to Enga=
ge. Maybe Mirant sold to Enron at $175/MWh and Enron sold to Engage at $125=
/MWh. Mirant would be quite happy to sell, instead, to Engage today for $12=
5/MWh rather than have to bring its power into today's $29 market. But Enga=
ge, assuming Enron couldn't deliver, wouldn't hear of it.=20
Holes To Plug Will Multiply=20

For days, energy companies have disclosed their exposures to Enron. Despite=
 billions of dollars of transactions on the books between most major tradin=
g companies with Enron, exposures are anywhere from nothing to $100 million=
. The numbers are relatively low because the companies are netting the bene=
fits of Enron's exit - in this case Engage - against the losses - think Mir=
ant. Engage and Mirant will switch positions many times over the next sever=
al weeks.=20
Meet in the marketplace they will, along with all the other Enron counterpa=
rties. Enron plugs like Silicon Valley are already being exceeded by a grow=
ing number of holes. So multiply Thursday's one electricity deal by thousan=
ds of similar situations on gas and power supplies in North America every d=
ay, to say nothing of Enron's other commodity contracts around the world.=
=20
Brokers, with their temporary burst of business, will be the only ones smil=
ing. But by the first of the year, the worst of the Enron energy market cha=
os will be a distant memory.=20
Well, maybe by the spring.=20

Enron Impact On Gas Sector Not Yet Clear - AGA Officials

11/30/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- It is too early to tell what impact the financial =
meltdown of Enron Corp. (ENE) will have for the natural gas sector, America=
n Gas Association officials said Friday.=20
"We can't tell you today" how Enron's problems will shake out in the gas se=
ctor and the economy, said David Parker, AGA's president and chief executiv=
e.
The "winners and losers" will depend on each individual company's exposure =
to Enron, Parker said.=20
"We're going to have a lot of sorting out time," said Michael Warren, Energ=
en Corp. (EGN) president and chief executive and AGA's incoming chairman.=
=20
The AGA officials spoke with reporters Friday, one day after Energen announ=
ced that its exposure to Enron would hurt the company's net an estimated 20=
-25 cents per share.=20
Enron recently warned its gas utility customers that its ongoing ability to=
 deliver is questionable, given the company's plight, Warren said. Neverthe=
less, he noted that many suppliers are stepping into the breach created by =
Enron's demise.=20
Having Enron fail at the cusp of the winter heating season is "momentous," =
but the markets "have not really missed a beat," Warren said.=20
Enron's rapid trading retreat "has not made this market collapse," he said,=
 marveling over "the resilience" of competitive markets.=20
Provoking laughter, Warren noted that a year ago, as natural gas prices wer=
e spiking, "Enron was asking us if we were creditworthy."=20
Parker and Warren said Enron's problems have worsened the reluctance of sta=
te regulators to open retail markets to competition in the wake of Californ=
ia's power market problems last year.=20
Twenty-three states have opened retail natural gas markets to competition, =
involving 80% of gas sold at retail, AGA said.=20
A year from now, the number will still be 23, Warren said. The one-two punc=
h of Enron and California have "reduce or retarded" the willingness of stat=
es to open up markets to competition, he said.=20

Enron Considering Options; Bankruptcy Decision Said Unlikely Before Next We=
ek

11/30/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Embattled energy-trading concern Enron Corp. is still considering all of it=
s options, including the likelihood of filing for bankruptcy protection und=
er Chapter 11, people close to the matter said. Such a decision, however, w=
on't occur before next week, these people said.=20
Some Enron employees are being told not to expect any action over the weeke=
nd, these people said.
The Chapter 11 process is designed to hold a company's creditors at bay whi=
le it hammers out a plan to reduce debt. Although people familiar with the =
situation insist an all-out liquidation -- known as a Chapter 7 filing -- i=
sn't in the cards, some industry observers continue to speculate that the b=
eleaguered company may be forced to go that route.=20
With its energy-trading business crippled by the downgrade Wednesday of mos=
t of its debt to junk status and a buyout by Dynegy Inc. (DYN) called off l=
ater that day, Enron's fortunes have been in a downward spiral.=20
As of 4 p.m. EST Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, shares of Enron (EN=
E) dropped 10 cents, or 28%, to 26 cents. The stock had traded above $90 a =
share last year, and, all told, equity shareholders have lost over $60 bill=
ion.=20
Enron's outstanding bonds trade at prices of around 15 cents on the dollar.=
 The selloff in Enron's bonds -- down from the upper 50-cent range before W=
ednesday's developments -- suggests bondholders don't expect much if any re=
covery on their investments.=20
There is little doubt that any bankruptcy proceedings will be complex and t=
ime-consuming, given the nearly $62 billion in assets on Enron's balance sh=
eet, as of its last quarterly financial report. Also, the bankruptcy court =
would have to wade through and untangle many items not listed on its balanc=
e sheet. Those financing vehicles are what sparked the company's troubles l=
ast month.=20
Enron's liabilities are still a matter of debate. The company has an estima=
ted $13 billion in debt on its balance sheet, and a further $7 billion in f=
inancings off the balance sheet. However, there may be other obligations lu=
rking in connection with its investment partnerships.=20
Since the debt downgrade, Enron's trading business appears damaged beyond r=
epair. Without a viable credit rating, the company no longer has access to =
the reams of cash it needs to run that business.=20
Underscoring Enron's woes, the company told some of its trading partners on=
 Friday that it will default on some of its deliveries of wholesale electri=
city under contract for Sunday and Monday, people familiar with the situati=
on said.=20
Some observers had expected Enron to file for bankruptcy protection as earl=
y as this week. But the people close to the situation said the complex busi=
ness structure is slowing the process. Where the company would file is also=
 a question: The Houston-based company could file where it is headquartered=
, but it is incorporated in Oregon, and many companies look to the favorabl=
e courts of Delaware whenever possible.=20
Enron hired restructuring and bankruptcy specialist Blackstone Group late l=
ast week to advise it on corporate matters and to help restructure its debt=
.=20
The company also is being advised by law firm Weil Gotshal & Manges, a bank=
ruptcy specialist.=20
Key Supplier Stops Delivery=20
Mirant Corp. (MIR) stopped delivering all power and natural gas to Enron so=
ld under existing contracts world-wide, traders and people familiar with th=
e situation said.=20
The move brings Enron's struggles in North America to a new level. Until no=
w, most companies had stopped making new trades with Enron, but continued t=
o deliver under their previously done deals. And Enron has been delivering =
under its contracts in North America.=20
Through Thursday, Enron was able to get third parties to step in and buy fr=
om Mirant and sell to Enron. In one transaction, for power to be delivered =
Saturday, Silicon Valley Power stepped into the middle. Silicon Valley Powe=
r, the municipal utility of Santa Clara, Calif., confirmed Thursday that it=
 had done so.=20
"That transaction for Saturday is based on a contractual obligation we made=
 to Enron in the past, when Enron was on a positive trading position with u=
s," said Silicon Valley's marketing manager, Larry Owens.=20
Energy-market sources expect other companies to follow suit with Mirant, an=
d they don't expect Enron will be able to find intervening third parties fo=
r much longer. Companies have the legal right to suspend deliveries if they=
 reasonably expect they won't get paid.=20
To date, Enron has paid its bills on time. Saturday gas and power deliverie=
s carry more risk than deals for delivery even Friday, as Enron won't have =
to pay for deliveries starting Dec. 1 until late January.=20
A spokesmen for Enron wouldn't comment. "We don't discuss activities with i=
ndividual counterparties," spokesman Eric Thode said.=20
Layoffs Begin in Europe=20
Enron officials said Friday the company will lay off all but a handful of i=
ts European employees.=20
A few staff will be retained to wind up the remaining operations of Enron i=
n Europe, which are now largely under the court-appointed administration of=
 PriceWaterhouseCoopers.=20
A statement issued by PriceWaterhouseCoopers said "approximately 1,100 redu=
ndancies have been made in the U.K. across the group, with 250 staff retain=
ed."=20
There was no word on the fate of Enron's employees elsewhere in Europe.=20
"The over-riding priority is to preserve the valuable parts of the business=
 and to reduce the cash needs of the business whilst seeking to secure the =
future of certain Enron businesses and its employees," PriceWaterhouseCoope=
rs senior administrator Tony Lomas said in the statement.=20
Separately, as of Friday, two of Enron's divisions -- Enron Capital and Tra=
de Resources Ltd. and Enron Gas and Petrochemical Trading Ltd. -- were in d=
efault regarding their obligations under the United Kingdom's Balancing and=
 Settlement Code, although U.K. balancing market operator Elexon stressed t=
hat regulators decided not to expel Enron from trading at this time.=20
"The panel will meet again on Dec. 5 to further discuss Enron, and have the=
 right to review their decision not to expel Enron at any time before that,=
" said a spokeswoman for Elexon.=20
In addition, German grid operators cancelled their grid-access contracts wi=
th Enron Capital & Trade Resources, effectively excluding it from all trans=
actions that involve delivery to, or transit through Germany, Europe's larg=
est power market and an essential part of Enron's European power activities=
.=20
Enron also has been suspended from trading on Nord Pool, the UKPX, the Amst=
erdam Power Exchange, the European Energy Exchange and the Automated Power =
Exchange's U.K. contracts.=20

Tables Turned As Commercial Banks Lick Enron Wounds
By Michael Mackenzie
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/30/2001
Dow Jones Capital Markets Report
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- After enduring one of the toughest operating environ=
ments in recent years, investment bankers can at least raise a smile that c=
ommercial banks are bearing the brunt of the fallout from the anticipated c=
ollapse of energy trading house Enron Corp. (ENE).=20
The likelihood that Enron will file for what would be a messy bankruptcy is=
 "sure to illustrate one of the fundamental differences between commercial =
banks and investment banks," noted analysts Van Hesser and Justin Ziegler a=
t Credit Suisse First Boston in New York.
The appetite of commercial banks for more exposure to an individual name th=
an their investment banking rivals is evident in a breakdown of the direct =
loan exposures to Enron, a list that's dominated by commercial banks.=20
According to ratings agency Fitch, J.P. Morgan Chase has $500 million in un=
secured exposure and at least a further $400 million that is secured. Citig=
roup (C), is gauged at having $800 million in exposure with $500 secured an=
d $300 million unsecured by Fitch. And another leading commercial entity, B=
ank of America Corp (BAC), is believed to have $300 million in direct loan =
exposure as at Sept. 30, note CSFB.=20
Extending loans to companies that can run into problems, "is definitely the=
 risk in commercial banking, but such banks are well diversified and able t=
o absorb these situations," said Ken Worthington, director and equity analy=
st at CIBC World markets in New York.=20
However, in the case of J.P. Morgan Chase "which prides itself on passing c=
redit risk off to others through various means, including loan syndications=
 and hedging, this is a stunning figure," said Kathy Shanley, bank and fina=
nce analyst at Gimme Credit, an independent credit research firm in New Yor=
k.=20
In recent years, commercial banks have sought to leverage their diversified=
 structures by aggressively muscling into the territory of investment banks=
. They sought to underwrite corporate bond and stock issues - the tradition=
al turf of investment banks - by offering commercial banking sweetners such=
 as lines of credit and loans.=20
Investment banks do not enjoy the benefit of a substantial balance sheet an=
d tend to focus on underwriting and generally don't provide loans. And whil=
e investment banks have been forced by competitive pressures to extend lend=
ing facilities - demonstrated by Morgan Stanley's credit facilities to Luce=
nt Technologies - "they usually offload their balance sheet exposures in or=
der to lower their risk profile," said Worthington.=20
This in turn underlines the more selective approach that investment banks h=
ave to financial markets than their commercial banking cousins. While inves=
tment banks are not gun-shy of building risk exposures, the CSFB analysts b=
elieve "they tend to build fewer and they tend to be more disciplined about=
 it."=20
This helps explain why in respect to Enron, CSFB believes "broker exposures=
 are relatively light." The bank expects exposure to Enron at Goldman Sachs=
 Group (GS), and Morgan Stanley (MWD) "to be in the $50 to $100 million ran=
ge, while other major securities houses such as Bear Stearns Companies Inc =
(BSC), Lehman Brothers (LEH) and Merrill Lynch & Co. (MER) "should have exp=
osures that are relatively immaterial."=20
But the carnage at Enron has left some investment bankers looking better of=
f than the gungho commercial banks who sought juicy M&A fees by providing c=
reditlines to the company as it planned its ultimately doomed merger with D=
ynegy Inc. (DYN). As Citi and JPM face the prospect of a battle over the as=
sets of Enron in a bankruptcy filing, "Goldman Sachs sits on the sidelines =
with a cheshire cat grin, reminding investors it declined to extend a credi=
t line to Enron as a condition of signing on as a merger advisor," noted Gi=
mme Credit's Shanley.=20
The travails surrounding Enron and the big commercial banks, "reads like a =
case study dreamed up by the Securities Industry Association to illustrate =
why banks should never have been allowed in the investment banking business=
 in the first place," she said.=20
Although Goldman and Morgan Stanley have "meaningful energy trading operati=
ons," CSFB believe that both banks are well versed in hedging and structuri=
ng collaterized trading agreements. Such methods limit the potential for ga=
ping losses associated with failure of a counterparty to trades previously =
transacted.=20
Worthington at CIBC added, "what really drives the business of investment b=
anking are relationships and talent."=20
But mired at the bottom of the investment banking cycle, many firms have be=
en looking to combine their talented workforce with the attractive balance =
sheets of commercial banks in order to enhance their operation. They've loo=
ked to the success of Citigroup's vaunted one-stop shopping model, which co=
mbines banking services with the investment banking offerings of Salomon Sm=
ith Barney.=20
Although Fitch notes "the banking industry's stated exposures do not appear=
, in and of themselves, significant enough to have ratings implications," t=
he news from Enron is perhaps a timely reminder that cultivating a big bala=
nce sheet also carries certain risks.=20
That's not to say investment banking won't undergo further consolidation th=
at involves finding large balance sheets. The search for profits and econom=
ies of scale from building a joint commercial and investment banking franch=
ise are the stuff of many bankers' dreams.=20
Indeed, many analysts believe Merrill Lynch & Co. (MER) is preparing the wa=
y for a marriage with a commercial bank as it slashes running costs and sel=
ls and restructures its operations in Canada, Australia and Japan.=20
Yet the trend to wholesale consolidation between the two cultures of bankin=
g "will take a number of years to play out and it will be driven by the rel=
ative profitability a merger between commercial and investment banking will=
 likely deliver," said CIBC's Worthington. -By Michael Mackenzie, Dow Jones=

Enron Collapse Could Weigh Heavy On Some Insurers
By Chad Bray
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/30/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The insurance industry didn't need Enron Corp.'s (EN=
E) problems, particularly when it comes to reinsurance prices.=20
Primary insurers could be on the hook for as much as $2 billion in claims a=
gainst directors and officers policies, surety bonds and financial guarante=
es related to the Houston energy trading firm, which, among its options, is=
 considering seeking Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Some insurers also w=
ill likely take a hit in their investment portfolios if Enron defaults on i=
ts bond payments.
The loss would be material, but not devastating for the industry. However, =
amid the backdrop of the World Trade Center disaster, Enron's impact could =
pressure some firms going forward, particularly if most of their Enron risk=
 was ceded to reinsurers. "This event is likely to exacerbate the (reinsura=
nce) capacity shortfall in the market that already exists, making 2002 one =
of the more, if not the most, powerful pricing years in recent history," sa=
id Alice Schroeder, a Morgan Stanley insurance analyst.=20
Reinsurance prices were rising prior to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Rat=
es are expected to rise dramatically in light of the events as reinsurers g=
et a handle on how to insure this new risk in the U.S.=20
Aviation rates, for example, have already climbed 200% to 300% in some case=
s. Reinsurers also are willing to take on less risk, forcing primary insure=
rs to keep more of the coverage or write policies offering less coverage.=
=20
Chubb Corp. (CB), a Warren, N.J., insurer, said it was reviewing its surety=
 bonds related to Enron and could have a maximum net pretax exposure under =
outstanding surety bonds of about $220 million. The firm said its after-tax=
 exposure is $143 million, or 82 cents a share.=20
A company takes out a surety bond in the event it can't fulfill a contractu=
al obligation. Typically, surety bonds would pay out any monetary guarantee=
s if a company was unable do so. Surety bonds are often used to improve a f=
irm's credit rating.=20
The insurer was unable to estimate the actual amount, if any, that they may=
 be required to pay or the timing of those payments because of contingencie=
s, including the actions of others, possible judicial rulings or the amount=
s that Chubb may recover under surety bond documents. No claims have yet be=
en filed under the surety bonds.=20
Jay Cohen, a Merrill Lynch analyst, said Chubb's surety bond obligations in=
 regards to Enron generally guaranteed the delivery of natural gas to energ=
y producers, such as utilities. Each bond could have different defined even=
ts that would trigger a claim, such as a bankruptcy, Cohen said.=20
"The Enron loss will likely be a very sizable one in the surety line, a lin=
e that was not particularly effected by the Trade Center attack," Cohen sai=
d. "The loss will likely exceed $1 billion and we note that the industry wr=
ote surety premiums totaling $3.5 billion in 2000. We would expect this los=
s to have an effect on insurers' risk appetite pertaining to surety obligat=
ions."=20
Cohen said Chubb likely has reinsurance for its losses and that its gross e=
xposure is "above the $220 million maximum net exposure."=20
Ron Frank, a Salomon Smith Barney analyst, said, while the Enron situation =
is clearly "unusual," the loss should be viewed relative to Chubb's overall=
 financial condition, which is quite solid. He said Chubb's historical prof=
itability in surety is "very good even including Enron."=20
Frank noted the Chubb announcement didn't address any other exposure to Enr=
on, such as directors and officers liability. "Management did comment to us=
 that if they saw another exposure material to earnings per share, it would=
 have been released," Frank said. "We infer from this that reinsurance and =
reserves will meaningfully mitigate such exposures."=20
Large surety writers include St. Paul Cos. (SPC), American International Gr=
oup (AIG), CNA Financial (CNA), Act Ltd. (ACE), Safeco Corp. (SAFC) and the=
 Travelers unit of Citigroup Inc. (C). However, not all large writers of su=
rety obligations necessarily have an exposure to Enron.=20
At the same time, a major Enron loss could inhibit some traditional propert=
y-casualty insurers from writing financial guarantee-related risk in the fu=
ture, said Schroeder, the Morgan Stanley analyst.=20
Schroeder noted that could be a positive for traditional financial guaranto=
rs in terms of less competition, but could also be a concern.=20
For example, Ambac Financial Group Inc. (ABK) and MBIA Inc. (MBI), both tra=
ditional financial guarantors, have been able to "wrap" lower levels of ris=
k on certain collateralized debt obligation deals with traditional P&C insu=
rers, while taking the higher, or less risk prone, layers for themselves. B=
eing conservative in nature, they might not be willing to take on the more =
risky layers in the future. -By Chad Bray, Dow Jones Newswires, 201-938-529=

US Physical Gas Prices End Down Ahead Of Weekend

11/30/2001

HOUSTON (Dow Jones))--U.S. natural gas physical prices violently swerved ba=
ck and forth Friday in a 65 cents-to-85-cents range, as some traders scramb=
led to find gas for first-of-the-month delivery, traders said.=20
"It was an unusual secondary market for various reasons," a trader said.
Some marketers were dumping gas early on a low-demand weekend, but utilitie=
s with questionable suppliers came out bidding, and prices went north, he s=
aid.=20
Much of the problems came after several trading companies said they had sus=
pended trading with Enron Corp., which teetered on the brink of bankruptcy.=
=20
First-of-month dynamics - including balancing, storage and moderate weather=
 - played as much of a role in the bidding, however, traders said.=20
Behind-the-scenes, as credit managers discussed how to limit exposure to En=
ron, gas set for December and weekend delivery had to be rescheduled, trade=
rs said.=20
"You had marketers (Thursday) pushing the spreads to the Nymex so prices we=
re out of whack on Friday," said one Gulf Coast trader.=20
One trader said the confusion seen in the market is the result of "cutting =
people who are cutting Enron, the end result is the same. Someone might hav=
e just cut Enron's credit, so that gas has to go somewhere."=20
"There's five to 10 reasons why the market did what it did," he said. "Enro=
n's been a factor in our market for the last three weeks - it's on everyone=
's mind."=20
"It's just chaos more than anything," said Allen Rather, a funds analyst in=
 Houston.=20
At the benchmark Henry Hub in south Louisiana at midday, traders paid $1.45=
-$2.25 per million British thermal units, down 2 cents-65 cents.=20
Deals at Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Station No. 65 were done in a $1.27=
-$2.15/MMBtu range, down 25 cents-85 cents.=20
At the Katy hub in East Texas, buyers paid $1.75-$2.20/MMBtu, down 15 cents=
 to 56 cents. At the Houston Ship Channel, prices were in a $1.80-$2.30/MMB=
tu range, down 8 cents-53 cents.=20
In California at the Ehrlenberg border station, prices fell 15 cents-55 cen=
ts to a $1.90-$2.60/MMBtu range.=20
At Waha in West Texas, buyers paid $1.65-$2.05/MMBtu, down 33 cents-65 cent=
s.=20

USA: Enron directors' side deals raise eyebrows.

11/30/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

HOUSTON, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Directors of Enron Corp., already under fire fo=
r failing to identify and correct problems that brought the energy trading =
giant to the brink of collapse, had lucrative side deals with the company t=
hat drew added criticism from corporate governance experts on Friday.=20
The deals ranged from consulting jobs to purchases of goods and services fr=
om affiliated companies. They raised doubts about the board's independence =
from the senior managers they were supposed to supervise on behalf of the s=
tockholders, the experts said.
"Directors who have side consulting arrangements are not considered, under =
governance guidelines, to have the necessary independence from management,"=
 said Charles Elson, director of the Center for Corporate Governance at the=
 University of Delaware.=20
In contrast to the murky off-balance-sheet financing deals that played a ke=
y role in Enron's demise, the company made detailed disclosures of its deal=
s with members of its board of directors in a proxy statement published ear=
lier this year.=20
The document shows that in addition to his supervisory duties as an Enron d=
irector, John Urquhart was paid $493,914 last year for providing consulting=
 services to Enron.=20
"That's a huge amount of money. Best practice is no consulting fees to any =
directors," said Nell Minnow, an editor at business research group The Corp=
orate Library, which does extensive work on corporate governance issues.=20
Another Enron director, Lord John Wakeham, received $72,000 last year for a=
dvice on Enron's European operations.=20
Enron director Herbert Winokur was affiliated with the privately owned Nati=
onal Tank Co. that made sales to Enron worth $370,294 last year, the proxy =
statement said.=20
The document also shows that Enron paid $517,200 last year for travel servi=
ces provided to Enron employees. The travel agency business that provided t=
he services is 50 percent-owned by Sharon Lay, sister of Enron chairman and=
 chief executive Ken Lay.=20
"Most major companies do not engage in that dodge because it is such an obv=
ious one," Minnow said.

USA: Basic accounting tripped Enron, experts say.
By Deepa Babington

11/30/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Nov 29 (Reuters) - As experts look through the remains of Enron C=
orp. for someone to blame, eyes are turning toward the auditors who allowed=
 it to break accounting rules, rather than on the rules themselves.=20
Once the biggest trader in the newly deregulated power market, Enron is now=
 near collapse. The auditing profession, which gives financial statements t=
he stamp of approval, needs to be more vigilant to prevent similar future d=
isasters, the experts said.
"The auditors - the Big Five auditing firms - have got to look at themselve=
s and say, how can this sort of thing happen?" said David Hawkins, an accou=
nting consultant with Merrill Lynch and a professor at Harvard University.=
=20
"The rules are there. Have we lost our way, so to speak? Do we need a new c=
ompass direction?"=20
Enron, once a Wall Street darling with a share price that hit more than $90=
, started coming apart after it reported losses from transactions that were=
 led by its former chief financial officer and kept off its balance sheet.=
=20
Experts said it failed to apply generally accepted accounting principles an=
d failed to disclose sufficient information to explain its dealings.=20
Andersen, the accountancy firm that audited Enron's books, said such judgme=
nts are premature.=20
"The best idea is to gather information, as the Securities and Exchange Com=
mission and Enron board are doing, and then decide what lessons we can lear=
n," Andersen spokesman David Tabolt said. "Instant judgments often are base=
d on presumptions ... that often turn out later to be incorrect."=20
ACCOUNTING 101=20
But the rules that Enron appears to have violated are quite straightforward=
, according to some experts.=20
For example, recording the note Enron received in return for selling equity=
 to its limited partnerships as an asset is contrary to an accounting rule =
that bans such treatment unless the note is to be paid off in a few days, H=
awkins said.=20
Ultimately, those transactions turned sour, causing a $1.2 billion reductio=
n in shareholder equity and losses that contributed to a $1 billion third-q=
uarter charge.=20
"This is Accounting 101 here," said Paul Brown, chairman of the accounting =
department at New York University's Stern School of Business. "It may be th=
at the way it was dressed up was so complicated that it was hard for the au=
ditors to ferret it out but, then again, that's their job."=20
The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), which sets accounting rule=
s, said firms must disclose extensive information about related-party trans=
actions. Enron may well have violated the spirit of that law by inadequatel=
y explaining its transactions, the experts said.=20
When Enron began to unravel, analysts criticized Andersen for failing to ex=
plain the firm's dealings in its financial statements. Enron reported its t=
ransactions in cryptic footnotes that many said were almost incomprehensibl=
e.=20
Andersen has also come under fire for failing to consolidate those partners=
hips into Enron's books, which would have given a truer picture of Enron's =
debt.=20
Enron later restated its results to reflect those transactions in its books=
, cutting earnings by almost $600 million since 1997, effectively admitting=
 it made a mistake, but not before its credibility had been shattered.=20
On Thursday, Harvey Pitt, chairman of the SEC, which is investigating Enron=
 and Andersen, said that the agency is looking at whether accounting princi=
ples were applied "appropriately," and what may need changing.=20
PATCHING UP LOOPHOLES=20
To be sure, critics have long called for better accounting rules, particula=
rly those regarding the type of off-the-balance-sheet financing that Enron =
engaged in.=20
Tim Lucas, who heads a FASB task force on emerging issues, said FASB was tr=
ying to complete big projects on business combinations and asset retirement=
 obligations this year, before tackling the issue.=20
Lucas said the Enron saga may also hold some implications for rules on fina=
ncial instruments such as derivatives and recording them at fair value.=20
"We will certainly be aware of this (Enron situation) and if it sheds some =
light on an area where we can improve the rules we will try and do that," h=
e said. "But it's not obvious to me yet that it does."=20
But apart from raising questions about Andersen's role, the implications of=
 Enron's near collapse may well force the entire auditing community to do s=
ome serious soul searching to prevent future disasters. "This is a wake up =
call," New York University's Brown said.

CANADA: UPDATE 1-Enron collapse likely kills planned Ontario plant.

11/30/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

(Recasts with comments from area legislator in paragraph 3, adds Ontario Po=
wer Generation's Enron exposure paragraph 13)=20
TORONTO, Nov 30 (Reuters) - The collapse of U.S. energy trader Enron Corp. =
likely spells the end of plans by its Canadian subsidiary to build a C$200 =
million ($130 million) generating plant in southwestern Ontario.
But government officials said on Friday that shelving the plant would have =
little effect on the province's plans to open the electricity market to com=
petition next year.=20
"Enron had an option to purchase a parcel of land in St. Clair Township to =
build a peaker plant to generate electricity during peak periods," said Car=
oline DiCocco, the member of the provincial legislator for Sarnia-Lampton.=
=20
"The feeling in the community is that this is not going to happen because o=
f severe financial difficulties," she said.=20
Enron, North America's largest energy trader, now on the verge of collapse,=
 planned through Enron Canada Corp. to build a 400 megawatt generating plan=
t near Sarnia, Ontario. It recently renewed an option on the land in St. Cl=
air Township and was seeking various regulatory approvals.=20
However, Enron's Canadian president Rob Milnthorp told Reuters earlier this=
 year, that the firm had delayed construction of the plant until a clear da=
te was set for the province to open up the market to competition.=20
The company was not available for comment on Friday.=20
"We were aware that Enron had considered a plant and those plans have been =
on hold for some time now," said Mike Krizanc, a spokesman for Ontario's En=
ergy Ministry.=20
"The latest events affecting the company have no impact on what's happening=
 in Ontario in terms of competition and supply that we're anticipating," he=
 said.=20
Ontario, Canada's most populous province and the nation's industrial and ec=
onomic heartland, is set to unveil plans within the next two months for the=
 deregulated power market. The province has already pushed back its origina=
l November 2000 deadline by 18 months.=20
Earlier this year, it said it would open the market by May 2002.=20
Although the planned Enron plant will likely never be built, market experts=
 said the company could sell what infrastructure and development it had com=
pleted.=20
"That is potentially an attractive asset. But any time you're selling a hal=
f-built house, you know it's just not the best way to get value," said Tom =
Adams, executive director at industry watchdog Energy Probe in Toronto.=20
Meanwhile, Ontario Power Generation, the province's biggest electricity pro=
ducer, said in a release that its exposure to Enron was less than C$100,000=
 and therefore it "does not anticipate any adverse earnings impact" related=
 to its trading activities with the U.S. firm.=20

S&P: Credit Derivative Exposure to Enron is $6.3 Billion

11/30/2001
PR Newswire
(Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire)

NEW YORK, Nov. 30 /PRNewswire/ -- Standard & Poor's has reviewed a number o=
f credit derivative transactions in which Enron appears and found exposure =
to the company in three different types of these transactions. Divided amon=
g these deals, direct Enron credit exposure potentially could total $3.3 bi=
llion.=20
"Although much attention has been focused on Enron in relation to loan expo=
sures, the energy sector, and the commodities markets, it is also a named s=
ource of credit risk in many credit derivatives transactions," said Nik Kha=
kee, director of Standard & Poor's Structured Finance Derivatives group.
"In addition, Enron had an overall derivatives market strategy that include=
d credit derivatives. Thus Enron is not only a source of credit risk in der=
ivatives transactions, it is a source of risk to derivatives transactions a=
s it could possibly cause termination events in swaps that Enron has contra=
cted," Mr. Khakee continued.=20
On a global basis, Enron appears in 50 transactions as a reference entity o=
r reference obligation in pooled credit derivative transactions, meaning th=
at Enron is a credit exposure. Two counterparties transact a swap in which =
the default of Enron, as defined by specified credit event language defined=
 in the swap documentation, would lead to potential loss to one counterpart=
y, the floating-rate payer.=20
This loss is defined by a valuation process whereby a settlement value for =
the potential Enron exposure is determined. This value can often be the res=
ult of a bidding process in the market where dealers are solicited. This bi=
dding process is commonly referred to as cash settlement. Alternatively, ph=
ysical settlement may be selected as the settlement mechanism whereby an En=
ron fixed income instrument is exchanged for the notional value of the Enro=
n exposure in the overall pool.=20
These transactions total $79 billion in total notional amount. The potentia=
l Enron exposure in the deals in aggregate totals $3.3 billion or 0.75% of =
total notional exposure. It is important to note that these transactions ar=
e primarily investment grade credit derivative collateralized debt obligati=
ons in which credit support to rated noteholders typically averages 2%-4%. =
Therefore, a default of Enron and low recovery on Enron post- default would=
 significantly erode this credit support.=20
"Standard & Poor's is currently reviewing all transactions in which Enron i=
s a named reference entity for possible rating actions," Mr. Khakee said.=
=20
Enron may also appear in this same type of credit derivative transaction bu=
t as part of a small pool, rather than a large pool of overall credit expos=
ure. In this case, Enron may potentially be the single reference source of =
credit risk in a credit derivative transaction, irrespective of the credit =
risk posed by the actual counterparty risk in these transactions (which is =
not addressed in the estimated exposures identified above).=20
Enron appears as a reference credit in six transactions with potential tota=
l notional exposure to Enron of $2.7 billion in these single-name risk or s=
mall basket credit derivative transactions.=20
In addition, in December 2000, Enron began acting as the counterparty in sw=
ap transactions without also being the reference entity. As such, its count=
erparties are vulnerable to potential default by Enron as counterparty, eve=
n if it is not a reference source of credit exposure in a transaction.=20
In these transactions, any default by Enron as counterparty under the swap =
contract would initiate a process whereby termination of the swap contract =
is possible. The nondefaulting counterparty would have the option to replac=
e Enron with a new counterparty in the swaps. This could be done on the who=
le swap notional amount of credit exposure or the portfolio could be carved=
 up into pieces in order to distribute the risk across various counterparti=
es.=20
Whether transferred to one counterparty or many, this process, called assig=
nment, leads to a mark-to-market valuation. That mark is either in favor of=
 Enron or the counterparty Enron faces. Thus, after an Enron default, the c=
ounterparty could be exposed to a liquidity risk because it would have to m=
ake a mark-to-market payment to Enron. Conversely, if Enron has to make a m=
ark-to market payment to the counterparty, the counterparty may not be rece=
iving the payment, especially if insolvency proceedings commence.=20
Enron has secured ratings on three such credit derivative transactions in w=
hich a total notional amount of $3 billion of credit derivative exposure wa=
s traded.=20
To give some perspective on this number, Mr. Khakee explained that Standard=
 & Poor's credit derivatives analysts in New York who review pools of credi=
t exposure have reviewed transactions with a total notional amount of $23 b=
illion in the year to date. "The notional amount of $3 billion relative to =
Enron represents a larger percentage of overall rated credit derivative tra=
nsactions than would be expected of an entity that is not a traditional bro=
ker-dealer, investment bank, or insurer," he said.

Scope of Peer Review of Andersen Audit Practice to Be Expanded

11/30/2001
PR Newswire
(Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire)

CHICAGO, Nov. 30 /PRNewswire/ -- Andersen today announced Deloitte & Touche=
 will expand the scope of its peer review of Andersen's US accounting and a=
udit practice. The expanded procedures, which have been under consideration=
 for over two weeks, will include, among other things, review procedures in=
 Andersen's Houston office. Andersen asked for additional work in light of =
financial reporting issues at Enron Corp. Deloitte & Touche had independent=
ly determined it wanted to conduct additional procedures.=20
"Maintaining the trust and confidence of investors is a central tenet of ou=
r firm," said Joseph F. Berardino, managing partner and chief executive off=
icer. "We invest hundreds of millions of dollars each year to improve our a=
uditing tools and skills so that investors can rely on the Andersen signatu=
re as a sign of quality financial reporting. We are confident that our syst=
em of quality is strong. We are pleased with Deloitte & Touche's decision t=
o undertake additional review procedures."
The Public Oversight Board (POB) is charged with oversight of the accountin=
g profession's self-regulatory peer review process in the United States. Ev=
ery three years since 1978, major accounting firms, under the oversight of =
the POB, have been engaged to conduct comprehensive reviews of the accounti=
ng and audit practices of member firms in the American Institute of Certifi=
ed Public Accountant's (AICPA) SEC Practice Section (SECPS).=20
Peer reviews involve an assessment of a firm's system of quality control fo=
r its accounting and auditing practice under standards established by the S=
ECPS. This includes, among many other quality measures, an evaluation of a =
firm's audit methodology and tools as well as a review of certain audits in=
 select offices. Deloitte & Touche's work on the 2001 Andersen review was n=
earing completion when Enron announced certain financial reporting issues.=
=20
The 2001 peer review has been planned and under way for more than eight mon=
ths. To date, Deloitte & Touche reviewers and Andersen practice review team=
s have reviewed the system of quality, including audit work, in 30 offices =
involving more than 40 percent of Andersen's U.S. audit partners. The revie=
ws conducted by Andersen review teams were tested by Deloitte & Touche, as =
is customary, and were subject to the oversight of the POB.=20
"In light of recent developments, we believe that extending the peer review=
 to include work done in other offices, including Houston, and other proced=
ures that Deloitte & Touche deems appropriate and necessary is the right th=
ing to do," said Berardino. He noted that Andersen was the first major firm=
 to engage another firm to review its system of quality globally -- in 1977=
.=20
Andersen is a global leader in professional services. It provides integrate=
d solutions that draw on diverse and deep competencies in assurance, tax, c=
onsulting, corporate finance, and in some countries, legal services. Anders=
en employs 85,000 people in 84 countries. Andersen is frequently rated amon=
g the best places to work by leading publications around the world. It is a=
lso consistently ranked first in client satisfaction in independent surveys=
. Andersen has enjoyed uninterrupted growth since its founding in 1913. Its=
 2001 revenues totaled US$9.3 billion. Andersen refers to the brand identit=
y adopted by member firms of the Andersen global client service network. Le=

Fitch on Enron: The Coming Creditor Battle Over Enron's Assets

11/30/2001
Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 30, 2001--With total assets of $62.8 billio=
n at Sept. 30, 2001, Enron would become the biggest bankruptcy in United St=
ates history if it files for bankruptcy as expected. Fitch anticipates a le=
ngthy and contentious battle over Enron's assets. Some of the key issues fo=
r creditors are:=20

What is the Enterprise Value?
There are several issues that cloud an enterprise valuation of Enron. First=
 and foremost is the uncertain value remaining in Enron's wholesale trading=
 business. Approximately 75% of Enron's total 2000 Income before interest, =
minority interests and taxes was generated by the wholesale services segmen=
t, which consists primarily of the energy trading business. Based on recent=
 refusals of Enron's energy trading partners to accept the company as a cou=
nter-party and exacerbated by implementation of trading restrictions on the=
 company by the New York Mercantile Exchange, Fitch believes significant do=
ubt has been cast upon Enron's ability to continue to operate this business=
 at its previous scale. Further, previous valuations of bankrupt trading bu=
sinesses have been quite low. Therefore, Fitch believes it would be prudent=
 to assign a very conservative valuation to this segment in a recovery anal=
ysis. Secondly, due to the ongoing Securities and Exchange Commission inves=
tigation of Enron's accounting, and previous restatements of earnings, ther=
e exists uncertainty over the accuracy of historical earnings reports. Fina=
lly, Enron's retail energy segment is closely integrated with the company's=
 wholesale operations for energy supply. If the wholesale operations remain=
 shutdown, the future cash flow generation ability of the retail segment ma=
y be materially impaired.=20

How will the value of Enron's assets be allocated in a bankruptcy?=20

Fitch has conducted a preliminary analysis of recovery prospects for variou=
s creditor classes. Enron's pipeline business has historically been a stead=
y source of cash flow generation. A market comparable method of valuation f=
or the transportation segment results in strong recovery prospects for secu=
red creditors at Northern Natural and Transwestern. Fitch estimates there w=
ould be roughly $1 billion of residual value from the pipelines following t=
he satisfaction of their secured and unsecured claims and Dynegy's claim. A=
s part of the merger agreement with Enron, Dynegy injected $1.5 billion int=
o Enron in exchange for preferred stock in Enron's largest pipeline, Northe=
rn Natural Gas, which can be converted into ownership of the pipeline. Dyne=
gy has exercised this option. It is noted that as part of its investment in=
 the preferred stock, Dynegy negotiated the right to block a bankruptcy fil=
ing at this subsidiary.=20
Enron has various other assets that could be monetized to satisfy unsecured=
 creditor claims. Enron has an agreement to sell its Portland General Elect=
ric subsidiary for anticipated net proceeds of about $1.8 billion in cash o=
r cash equivalents in 2002. In addition, Enron has contracted to sell $800 =
million of merchant assets which is expected to close before year end, subj=
ect to execution risks including regulatory and transfer risks. The net pro=
ceeds that could be realized from cash on hand, inventories, and various ot=
her monetizable assets are difficult to estimate. Moreover, the full extent=
 to which the company's assets have been pledged is uncertain.=20
The outstanding amount of senior unsecured debt is currently estimated to b=
e about $11 billion, excluding possible liabilities arising from trust stru=
ctures such as Marlin and Osprey. Additionally, other general unsecured cla=
ims in a bankruptcy would include customer deposits, minority interests, pr=
oject and structured finance make whole obligations, as well as an unknown =
amount of amount of exposure to is shareholders, employees and others relat=
ing to the spate of recent litigation against Enron. The amount of these ot=
her general unsecured claims can not be determined at this time.=20
Despite the fluidity of the situation, Fitch's preliminary view is that uns=
ecured creditors would realize recoveries in the 20-40% range. This opinion=
 considers the deterioration in the value of the wholesale trading business=
, the pledge of flagship assets to secured creditors, the uncertain cashflo=
w generation prospects of the retail segment in light of the wholesale busi=
ness situation, the opaque and uncertain accounting and off balance sheet l=
iability issues, and other unexpected liabilities.=20

Will Enron be able to continue to operate as a going concern or seek to liq=
uidate assets?=20

Enron would require a sizable debtor in possession facility to fund ongoing=
 operations and induce counter-parties to resume business with Enron. Fitch=
 believes it is uncertain whether Enron has adequate unencumbered or over- =
collateralized assets to obtain a DIP large enough to enable the resumption=
 of wholesale operations.=20

What is the situation for secured creditors to Marlin Water Trust II and Os=
prey Trust?=20

The ratings of Marlin's $915 million senior secured notes and Osprey's $2.4=
 billion senior secured notes rely on support of Enron. A liquidation of th=
e underlying assets is the primary source of repayment. A shortfall in liqu=
idation proceeds would become a claim against Enron, which may be subject t=
o subordination to the claims of other creditors in a bankruptcy.

S&P Places Sutton Bridge Power's 'BBB' Ratings on CreditWatch Negative

NEW YORK, Nov. 30 /PRNewswire/ -- Standard & Poor's today placed its triple=
-'B' rating on Sutton Bridge Power's (SBP) guaranteed GBP195 million (US$31=
0 million) and US$150 million secured bonds, issued by Sutton Bridge Power =

 debt-service payments if the existing 25-year swap with Enron Corp. is not=
 fundamentally restructured.=20
The rating action results from the downgrade of Enron Corp.'s corporate cre=
dit rating to single-'B'-minus by Standard & Poor's. Enron, through Enron C=
apital & Trade Resources Corp., is a counterparty in the 25-year (until 202=
2) U.K. pound/U.S. dollar swap with Sutton Bridge Financing. A possible res=
tructuring or cancellation of the swap may expose bondholders to currency e=
xchange risk.
Standard & Poor's will be shortly meeting with London Electricity PLC's (LE=
) management (which owns the Sutton Bridge Power plant) to discuss, among o=
ther things, LE's options for hedging the currency exposure at SBP that wil=
l preserve SBP's credit strength.
