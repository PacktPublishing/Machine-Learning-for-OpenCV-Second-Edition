With its principal business in peril, Enron agreed to be acquired by Dynegy=
 for $9 billion -- one-ninth what it was worth last year. Enron, of Houston=
, used political muscle and trading-floor savvy to create new markets for e=
lectricity and gas and become the nation's dominant energy trader. Yet its =
refusal to explain its finances caught up to it last month, when investors =
fled after disclosure of an S.E.C. probe and an unusual $1.2 billion reduct=
ion in shareholder equity. After it admitted overstating profits by $600 mi=
llion, other energy companies began to shun Enron, putting its trading busi=
ness in jeopardy. Finally, a humbled Enron, out of options, threw itself in=
to the arms of Dynegy, its much smaller crosstown rival. Richard A. Oppel J=

Stocks posted big gains this past week, pushing the Dow Jones industrial av=
erage to its highest close since the Sept. 11 attacks.=20
The Federal Reserve's half-point reduction of short-term interest rates on =
Tuesday, to 2 percent -- the 10th cut this year -- was a big reason for the=
 advance. Investors bought stocks on optimism that the latest cut would fin=
ally help stimulate the economy.
Equities got a further lift when reports emerged on Friday that seemed to r=
un counter to the Fed's prediction that the economy would worsen, suggestin=
g an economic turnaround had already started. The University of Michigan's =
monthly index of consumer sentiment, a widely followed barometer, showed a =
November improvement in attitudes about finances and the economy.=20
For the week, the Dow Jones industrials rose 284.46, or 3.05 percent, to 9,=
608.00, the first time since the Sept. 11 attacks that the average had clos=
ed above its Sept. 10 finish of 9,605.51. The Nasdaq composite index rose 8=
2.75, or 4.74 percent, to 1,828.48. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index r=
ose 36.21, or 3.34 percent, to 1,120.31. Both the Nasdaq and S.& P. indexes=
 regained their pre-attack levels in October. MICHAEL BRICK

Dealings of Enron emerging

The Enron name may soon fade away, but the federal securities investigation=
 that helped erode the energy giant's foundation is not over yet.=20
The 3 1/2-week-old Securities and Exchange Commission probe into Enron Corp=
.'s finances is likely drawing closer to answering questions about complex =
partnerships that wiped out more than $1 billion in shareholder value and a=
lmost $600 million in profits.
SEC officials don't discuss their works in progress, but already the result=
s are becoming clear.=20
The company admitted that massive accounting errors over the past four year=
s led it to overstate its profits and understate its debts, an admission th=
at no doubt saved the company from some SEC penalties, say observers.=20
And the company has gradually distanced itself from its former chief financ=
ial officer - considered the architect behind some of the deals - and indic=
ated that other employees were personally involved in the partnerships with=
out its knowledge. But the culpability of Enron's current or former employe=
es, if any, won't be clear for some time.=20
On Oct. 17, the day after Enron reported an unexpected third- quarter loss,=
 the SEC began asking Enron questions about two off- balance-sheet partners=
hips, called LJM1 and LJM2. They were formed to help the company grow witho=
ut adding additional debt or diluting stock valuations, and were also used =
to help hedge against the risks in some of Enron's newer lines of business.=
=20
Former CFO Andy Fastow formed the partnerships with the approval of the com=
pany's board of directors, attorneys and auditors. His dual role as CFO and=
 managing partner of those two partnerships had the appearance of a conflic=
t of interest, even though Enron insisted that measures were taken to preve=
nt any illegal or unethical behavior.=20
The SEC's role in looking at the partnerships isn't to prevent company exec=
utives from having conflicts of interest in their dealings, however, but ra=
ther to make sure the companies fully disclose those conflicts or any situa=
tions that may appear to be conflicts, said John Coates, a professor at Har=
vard Law school.=20
"So although they have a role in determining that all the information in En=
ron's proxy was correct and that all transactions were reported, they were =
not responsible for determining whether or not the transactions were done o=
n fair terms," Coates said.=20
Item 404 of SEC Regulation S-K requires companies to disclose any transacti=
ons where executive officers personally benefit by $60,000 or more. That di=
sclosure should include their direct and indirect interests in the deal, th=
e amount of money or assets they receive through it and other information.=
=20
As in all rules, however, there are certain exceptions.=20
If an executive's compensation from a deal is less than 10 percent of the v=
alue of the overall transaction, they may not need to disclose all of those=
 details, Coates said. That stipulation could possible give Enron cover for=
 not having previously disclosed the $30 million Fastow earned through the =
partnerships.=20
"But there are times when the companies may have followed the letter of the=
 rules and the SEC still pushes them to fully disclose the details," he sai=
d.=20
Whether or not Enron needed to disclose previously the investments or profi=
ts that a number of other employees made in some of the partnerships is als=
o hard to discern.=20
The company said this week that in addition to Fastow, five other employees=
 invested in the deals. Two of those employees - Ben Glisan, a managing dir=
ector and treasurer of Enron Corp., and Kristina Mordaunt, a managing direc=
tor and general counsel of an Enron division - were terminated by Enron thi=
s week. The other employees, including Fastow and executives Michael Kopper=
, Kathy Lynn and Anne Yeager, no longer work for Enron.=20
The company didn't mention how much those individuals invested or how much =
benefit, if any, they reaped from the deals. Some of the employees may not =
even fall under the disclosure rule since it doesn't give a clear definitio=
n of what positions are "executive officers."=20
The company has gradually distanced itself from Fastow and the partnerships=
 since the problems arose. Shortly after the earnings report last month Lay=
 said he and the board stood by Fastow, but a day later replaced him.=20
On Oct. 31, the day Enron said the SEC had upgraded its review of the finan=
ces from a simple inquiry to a formal investigation, the company announced =
that its board of directors had created a special investigation committee o=
f its own. A company spokeswoman stressed that the committee had the power =
to take disciplinary action against any Enron employee, officer or director=
 who it determines "improperly participated in the transactions."=20
In its SEC filing that outlined the partnerships on Thursday, the company s=
aid it was aware of the partnerships but required that certain safeguards b=
e put in place and that the transactions be approved and reviewed regularly=
.=20
"Whether these controls and procedures were properly implemented is a subje=
ct of the Special Committee's investigation," the statement said.=20
At a Friday news conference, Lay said the board was aware of the formation =
of one of the partnerships but that he was not aware that Glisan and Mordau=
nt were investing in the partnerships. Lay deflected many of the questions =
regarding the investigation, saying a conference call would be held next we=
ek.=20
Shareholders have lined up behind lawsuits against the company, the partner=
ships, and even the company's law firm, Vinson & Elkins.=20
"Disclosure cases and state corporate law cases are all but assured in situ=
ations like this," Coates said. "Even if the SEC does very little, the shar=
eholders will still line up."

Demise of Enron a blow to city / As local business pillars crumble, Dynegy =
a bright spot

It seems like only days ago that Enron Corp. was being held up as an exampl=
e of a company that could see the future.=20
The wizards of Wall Street were marveling at the corporation's bold, innova=
tive strategies.
In Houston, high-flying Enron was erecting its new headquarters downtown, a=
 tall and shiny skyscraper, the city's first in more than a decade.=20
And now, almost suddenly, Enron is vanishing.=20
In the past few months, three pillars of Houston's economy and business lea=
dership have fallen on hard times. Compaq Computer Corp., the centerpiece o=
f Houston's technology image, may be sold. Continental Airlines has laid of=
f thousands as it adjusts to a slowing economy and the aftermath of Sept. 1=
1 in the travel business.=20
And only months ago, Houston lost the headquarters of American General as t=
he company was sold to American International Group.=20
Now Enron will disappear as it is absorbed by one of its rivals.=20
What impact does all of this negative business news have on Houston's image=
?=20
The recent wave of corporate downturns has some experts concerned, but othe=
rs say that when they look at the big picture they are still optimistic.=20
"The fact we have had multiple blows has certainly had a negative effect in=
 the short run," said Barton Smith, director of the Institute for Regional =
Forecasting at the University of Houston.=20
But in the long run, Smith said, a city's future has more to do with its qu=
ality of life and the quality of its infrastructure than whether the city h=
as lost or attracted a major headquarters.=20
"When Boeing left Seattle, we said, `Poor Seattle,' " Smith said. "(Three m=
onths later) Seattle is still growing and still known as a good place to li=
ve."=20
What is more important in terms of Houston's corporate image and its image =
in general, Smith said, is "whether it's easy to get around and get to work=
 and how smoothly a businessman can get to Tokyo or London."=20
Smith believes Houstonians should be more concerned about other local probl=
ems such as getting the city's pollution problem "under control in a ration=
al way." If Houston continues to be known as one of the most polluted citie=
s in America, Smith said, "that will continue to haunt us."=20
The demise of Enron is "certainly not good news, nor was Compaq good news,"=
 said Steve Klineberg, a Rice University professor of sociology.=20
The two companies enhanced the city's image and stature, Klineberg said, in=
 that they signified that Houston was moving out of a 20th- century oil-bas=
ed economy into a 21st-century economy based on information and technology.=
=20
In terms of image, the Enron news is more damaging within the business comm=
unity than to the perception of Houston by the world at large, said Steve C=
urrall, associate professor of management psychology and statistics at the =
Jesse H. Jones Graduate School of Management at Rice University.=20
"Enron has very little business-to-consumer activity, and for the average p=
erson on the street" it doesn't mean much, he said.=20
But it is significant to the business community, Currall said. Enron has be=
en a Fortune 10 company and consistently ranked as one of the most innovati=
ve companies in America. "And I think the struggles of Enron (have) a negat=
ive impact" in the business community, he said.=20
"Houston has benefited from a company like Enron, which has made the city a=
 world headquarters for energy trading," Currall said. "It made us a hub fo=
r the development of financial management innovations.=20
"It's part of the reason why Enron and Dynegy resonate with the Wall Street=
 gang. They say, `That trading stuff down there is cool.' It's the converge=
nce of highly sophisticated finance and the energy industry."=20
Currall said he is delighted that Dynegy is Enron's "suitor" because it kee=
ps the people and operations in Houston.=20
"That's great news for Houston," he said.=20
Others agreed that the presence of Dynegy in Houston will soften the blow.=
=20
Enron being bought by Dynegy, another Houston firm, is "like a couple of co=
usins getting together," said Barry Silverman, a marketing and management c=
onsultant.=20
"In a sense, there is no loss for Houston," said David Crossley, president =
of the Gulf Coast Institute, a nonprofit group that promotes quality-of-lif=
e issues in the area.=20
"Who would have thought that a company in Houston was capable of buying Enr=
on?" Crossley said. It makes Dynegy a bigger company and, he said, creates =
a certain mystique about Houston since both cutting- edge businesses are he=
re.=20
David Morris, the managing partner of the Houston office of Heidrick & Stru=
ggles, an executive recruiting firm, believes that Houston has been unfairl=
y stereotyped as having a "gunslinger" style of business environment, and h=
e is concerned that "what's perceived as a gunslinging type of accounting a=
t Enron will be underscored once again."=20
But what should really be emphasized, Morris said, is Houston's creativity.=
=20
"That Enron took an old-line industry of gas transmission and re- created i=
t into the marketing of gas and trading of gas and hedging of the price for=
 gas - creating different value streams in the same industry - and did it b=
efore the rest of the world could grasp it all is pretty amazing, and none =
of that is going away," he said.=20
That point was echoed by Don Henderson, vice president and managing directo=
r of Hyatt Regency, Houston, and the recent chairman of the Greater Houston=
 Convention and Visitors Bureau.=20
"When you think of New York, you think of the stock market," he said, "and =
when you think of Chicago, you think of agribusiness.=20
"And more and more when you think of Houston, it's energy as a commodity. A=
nd it's only going to be stronger with all the mergers and acquisitions bec=
ause the business of trading energy as a commodity is only going to grow."=
=20
Henderson maintained that Houston is still the envy of much of the country.=
=20
Houston has always been one of the continuously booming economies, he said,=
 and "has bounced back quicker and stronger than any region."=20
To offer an example of the city's resilience and appeal, Henderson noted th=
at Hewlett-Packard Chief Executive Officer Carly Fiorina recently stated th=
at the work force of Compaq's Houston campus might increase in size in part=
 because of the city's business-friendly environment compared to what she d=
escribed as a less friendly business climate in California.=20
Silverman maintained that the recent experiences of various local businesse=
s "won't hurt our image at all."=20
"In this global economy, you often see companies changing names and headqua=
rters," he said. "It's like a Monopoly game.=20
"I bet if I asked 100 people where Microsoft is headquartered, 50 of them c=
ouldn't tell me."

FLYING BLIND / By keeping investors in the dark, Enron lost its way

Last spring, Enron Chairman Ken Lay told a leadership forum at the Universi=
ty of Houston that his goal was to make Enron the No. 1 company in the worl=
d. Six months later, Enron was fighting for its life. In a $7.8 billion sto=
ck deal struck Friday, Enron will cease to exist as its operations are fold=
ed into rival Houston energy firm Dynegy.=20
Enron, in recent years one of Houston's most important corporations, did no=
t reach this pass because its ambitions were too high. Unlike the mythical =
Icarus, Enron did not fly too near the sun, melting the wax of its wings.
Enron's troubles came because some of its top executives chose to do much o=
f their piloting under cover of darkness. In the process, they lost their w=
ay.=20
By using several mysterious partnerships to finance projects and shield ris=
k and debt from public scrutiny, Enron's leaders set the stage for the vici=
ous circle in which drops in earnings and investor confidence and creditwor=
thiness followed and exacerbated one another. The deals became so complicat=
ed and impenetrable that Enron's directors, who approved them, no longer kn=
ew whether the company's revenues and assets were coming or going.=20
The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Enron's financial a=
rrangements and questionable bookkeeping, and an Enron spokesman says the c=
ompany now finds it difficult to know the state of the partnerships it owne=
d or controlled. Following months during which Enron's announcements regard=
ing departing executives lacked both accuracy and candor, the company this =
past week restated its finances back to 1997, subtracting $586 million from=
 its net income and adding $2.5 billion to its debt. Regardless of what the=
 SEC inquiry finds, Enron's revised accounting makes a good case for congre=
ssional or regulatory elimination of whatever loopholes allowed Enron to in=
flate its income and obscure its debt.=20
Enron officials say a special board committee is investigating the financia=
l arrangements between former Enron executives and the obscure investment p=
artnerships they managed or controlled. An Enron spokesman said the committ=
ee would make public its findings "at an appropriate time." The appropriate=
ness of that time diminishes the further it gets from the present.=20
Neither Enron officials nor investors need to wait for the committee's repo=
rt to conclude that letting executives profit on the side from the partners=
hips while sticking stockholders with the liabilities was inappropriate. Fo=
r the sake of Enron, its stockholders and the citizens of Houston, who depe=
nd on Enron's contribution to the economy and the civic life of the city, t=
hat arrangement must not be repeated.=20
Much of Enron's problems stem from straightforward but imprudent or ill-tim=
ed investments: a power plant in India, broadband capacity not needed in a =
collapsing telecommunications market, and a doomed venture into the water b=
usiness - Azurix Corp.=20
Those losses might have been survivable, had Enron not denied its own trans=
actions the transparency it sought for global energy markets.

Deregulation Not Derailed by California's Meltdown Power: Though many energ=
y firms were scarred in the state's free-market stumble, analysts say they =
are likely to rebound.

Branded as lawless cowboys by California politicians and consumer advocates=
, energy merchants rode skyrocketing electricity and natural gas prices to =
new stock highs during the worst of California's energy crisis.=20
But in recent months these energy companies--names such as Duke, Dynegy, Re=
liant, AES, Mirant, Williams and El Paso Corp.--have seen their fortunes di=
m as California's electricity meltdown has slowed the pace of deregulation =
nationwide, power prices have tumbled and the economy has faltered.
Even power plant owners and energy trading operations that have maintained =
healthy earnings growth have watched their stock performance fade.=20
And then there's the Enron Effect.=20
Enron Corp., cast as the heavy by California politicians, has suffered the =
biggest fall of all and has helped to drag down stocks of other energy prod=
ucers and traders.=20
Enron's woes appear to be a special case in that they flow less from its en=
ergy businesses than from a loss of investor confidence in the company's co=
mplex and shadowy financial structure, with a resulting cash crunch.=20
Nonetheless, Enron's detractors are crowing at the rapid decline of the tru=
est believer in electricity deregulation, the movement to take businesses c=
ontrolled for decades by monopoly utilities and throw open the generation, =
trading and retail sale of electricity to new competitors.=20
But just as Enron is not dead, neither is electricity deregulation, energy =
experts contend. Though several states have delayed their deregulation plan=
s and some major corporate players are tempering their enthusiasm, other st=
ates and corporations press ahead.=20
It's a tough new world for energy companies that will bring profit opportun=
ities for some and acquisitions of low-priced players, analysts say. Enron,=
 once the most brash of the energy peddlers, has agreed to be acquired by a=
rchrival Dynegy Inc. in a $7.7-billion stock deal.=20
Yet when the economy and power prices improve, energy companies will see th=
eir prospects gleam again, analysts say.=20
"Deregulation is a train that's not going to be derailed. It may be delayed=
, but it's coming," said Jon Kyle Cartwright, senior energy analyst with br=
okerage firm Raymond James & Associates.=20
"When the economy rebounds, we're going to see higher energy prices again,"=
 Cartwright said. "That means that the guys who sell power, the guys who ma=
nufacture power--they're going to have very bright futures."=20
Less than a year ago, when energy prices were headed for record territory i=
n California and a winter of electricity shortages plagued the state, the f=
avorite whipping boys of Gov. Gray Davis and other politicians were such en=
ergy sellers as Enron, AES Corp., Dynegy, Duke Energy Corp., Reliant Energy=
 Inc., Mirant Corp., Williams Cos. and El Paso Corp.=20
All are energy companies that own power plants in California or sell electr=
icity or natural gas in the state at prices deemed by state officials to be=
 higher than those a truly competitive market would have produced. The ener=
gy companies have denied that they overcharged Californians, and federal re=
gulators investigating the matter have so far ordered only limited refunds =
of electricity revenues.=20
Nonetheless, Southern California Edison Co. and Pacific Gas & Electric Co. =
lost so much money paying for electricity--costs they could not pass on to =
customers because of a rate freeze--that they became insolvent. PG&E filed =
for bankruptcy protection.=20
California's near-death experience in electricity markets brought state gov=
ernment into the power business in unanticipated ways when lawmakers passed=
 the landmark deregulation bill in 1996.=20
The state became the primary electricity buyer for the big utilities' custo=
mers and formed a power authority to build power plants and transmission li=
nes, becoming potential competition to generation companies. State regulato=
rs blocked electricity sellers from signing up new retail customers, a prog=
ram known as "direct access" that is one of the key components of electrici=
ty deregulation.=20
Players Refocusing on Other Operations=20
The energy spectacle in California caused several states to short-circuit d=
eregulation plans or to take a much slower approach that could delay for ye=
ars the opening of those markets to competition.=20
Energy companies also are now contending with lower electricity prices, whi=
ch have plummeted since the beginning of the year, thanks to lower natural =
gas prices and temperate weather. And volatility has nearly disappeared, th=
ereby cutting profit potential for energy trading firms.=20
The economic downturn will reduce demand for electricity, analysts said, wh=
ich also will hurt earnings at a range of companies.=20
The pain was apparent in third-quarter results.=20
"After several quarters of across-the-board strong results, we are now in m=
ore of a winners-and-losers environment, as low commodity prices and a weak=
 economy make conditions more difficult," Merrill Lynch energy analyst Stev=
en Fleishman said in a recent note to clients.=20
Some big and mid-size players have stumbled, and a few have slowed their he=
adlong rush into unregulated businesses that had until recently held promis=
e for these companies, many of them utilities that branched out.=20
A prime example is AES, which generates electricity in California, across t=
he nation and in 26 other countries. AES said third-quarter net income fell=
 98% because of a sharp drop in profit from its operations in Brazil and Br=
itain. AES reduced its earnings estimates for the year and said it will ref=
ocus on its core energy business, look for divestiture opportunities and no=
t invest in any more telecommunications businesses, dropping its hostile $1=
.37-billion bid last week to take over a Venezuelan telecom firm.=20
Reliant Energy said its wholesale energy operation had a 15% drop in third-=
quarter operating income, blaming lower gas and power prices, plus legal an=
d other costs related to the California electricity crisis. The company's E=
uropean operations lost $5 million because of lower profit brought about by=
 deregulation in the Netherlands, and Reliant now is considering selling it=
s European businesses.=20
Constellation Energy Group, which owns the utility in Baltimore and is buil=
ding power plants in California and around the country, abandoned plans to =
spin off its trading operation after it said earnings for the year will com=
e in at the low end of estimates.=20
One California firm that appeared poised to benefit from electricity shorta=
ges was Chatsworth-based Capstone Turbine Corp., which manufactures micro-t=
urbines that supply power to a small business or a cluster of homes.=20
But struggling Capstone said third-quarter revenue dropped by nearly half a=
nd its net loss widened by 54% to $12.5 million as California dodged a summ=
er of blackouts and the economy slowed.=20
Energy Giant Takes an Unexpected Loss=20
The company hired a new chief operating officer and said it would restructu=
re and lay off an undisclosed number of employees.=20
The biggest surprise came from Enron, which broke a run of 16 profitable qu=
arters, reporting a $635-million net loss for the third quarter because of =
a $1-billion charge from failed investments in water and telecommunications=
. The Houston-based energy giant also revealed that two of its off-balance-=
sheet investment partnerships, headed until July by its chief financial off=
icer, led to $35million of the losses and chipped $1.2billion off sharehold=
er equity in the third quarter.=20
Investors began this month to dump the stock, and Enron's credit rating ero=
ded amid lawsuits, news of a probe by the Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n into conflicts of interest and attempts by management to soothe fears.=20
Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, who ran the two partnerships, =
was pushed out and the firm lined up new financing and went looking for new=
 investors.=20
Enron has used an opaque grid of off-balance-sheet partnerships to shelter =
assets and debt to help the company's push into a variety of deregulated ma=
rkets in recent years. But analysts and investors fear that Enron is hiding=
 money-losing assets in the partnerships; management has been tight-lipped =
about the purpose and holdings of the investment vehicles.=20
Takeover rumors swirled last week around Enron before Dynegy announced the =
deal Friday, underscoring predictions of general industry consolidation bec=
ause of low stock prices.=20
Some Firms Thriving, but Not Their Stocks=20
Some companies are still going strong, although their stocks remain depress=
ed.=20
That includes companies on the receiving end of potshots from California's =
politicians and utility regulators such as Duke Energy, Dynegy, Mirant, NRG=
 Corp. and Williams, as well as San Jose-based Calpine Corp., which was rep=
eatedly praised by Davis for playing a constructive role during the crisis.=
=20
Calpine, for instance, said third-quarter profit and revenue doubled becaus=
e the electricity producer increased sales by adding power plants. And yet =
its stock is down 55% from a 52-week high of $58 reached in March.=20
"These are the energy merchants that seem to have the best grasp on the mar=
ket and on risk management," said Chris Ellinghaus, power and natural gas a=
nalyst with Williams Capital in New York. Many of these companies are diver=
sified geographically and by the fuel they use to generate electricity and =
had locked in favorable contracts that protected them when power prices fel=
l this summer, he said.=20
ABN Amro utility analyst Paul Patterson said investors have turned away fro=
m these companies, even the healthy ones, because the business "isn't as ex=
citing as it used to be."=20
"People go on earnings momentum. It's kind of like having your dessert firs=
t," Patterson said. "Once the best is over, you lose your appetite."=20
One company trying to adapt to deregulation's devolution in California is C=
ommonwealth Energy Corp., which has survived a run-in with the California P=
ublic Utilities Commission and the suspension in California of direct acces=
s, Commonwealth's primary business of selling electricity directly to consu=
mers and businesses.=20
Commonwealth Energy was one of the more than 300 companies that flocked to =
California to sell retail electricity to the customers of Southern Californ=
ia Edison, PG&E and San Diego Gas & Electric Co. All but about a dozen of t=
he electricity sellers failed, and Commonwealth enjoyed initial success ped=
dling low-priced power from renewable sources.=20
But the Tustin-based company and its founder, Fred Bloom, ran afoul of the =
PUC for faulty billing practices and Bloom's failure to disclose that he ha=
d been ordered to stop selling unregistered securities by five states.=20
Commonwealth Energy settled the matter by paying about $350,000 and reimbur=
sing customers. Bloom was banished from the firm as part of the settlement,=
 and an all-new management team set about diversifying away from deregulate=
d businesses, said Ian Carter, the company's chairman and chief executive.=
=20
The firm, which recently became registered as a public company but can't se=
ll stock until January, is earning a profit, largely because it has been ab=
le to resell contracted energy for more than it paid.=20
To maintain its growth, the company is turning away from deregulation and t=
oward providing back-office services for regulated companies, generators an=
d municipalities, Carter said.=20
For the fiscal year ended July 31, Commonwealth Energy posted revenue of $1=
83 million, up 84%, and income of $60.5 million, compared with a loss of $8=
.6 million in the previous fiscal year.=20
"We certainly don't consider ourselves a casualty of deregulation or direct=
 access," Carter said, noting that the company still sells electricity to 5=
5,000 California business and residential customers and to cities, includin=
g Santa Monica and Palmdale.=20
"We realized that we needed to diversify and we needed to do that fairly qu=
ickly," Carter said. The company has nearly 40,000 retail customers in Penn=
sylvania and will be entering Texas, Michigan, New Jersey and Ohio, he said=
.=20
Seven states have delayed their push toward open markets, and some of those=
 that remain on track, such as Texas, have run into unforeseen glitches tha=
t delay the process of giving electricity customers choices beyond their tr=
aditional utilities.=20
Deregulation marches on in power trading and generation.=20
The Electric Power Supply Assn., a Washington-based trade group, said last =
week that competitive power supplies account for slightly more than a third=
 of the nation's generation capacity, up from 8.5% in 1997. Wholesale power=
 trading could approach 7 billion megawatt-hours this year, up from 2.6 bil=
lion in 1999, the group said.=20
Federal regulators are in the middle of determining how to reallocate contr=
ol of electricity transmission lines into only a few regional operators, pe=
rhaps owned by new for-profit companies other than utilities.=20
This process shows that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission remains de=
termined to open electricity markets despite the problems in California, sa=
id Lawrence J. Makovich, senior director of the North American power practi=
ce at Cambridge Energy Research Associates.=20
"We've got major parts of the electricity business moving backward, and Cal=
ifornia is the prime example," Makovich said. "But when you look at other p=
laces in the country, what you see is a continuing evolution to a much more=
 market-based power situation."=20
David Jermain, a principal in the national utility practice of Andersen LLP=
, said California will remain on the sidelines for years, paying higher pri=
ces than those produced by competitive markets. It also must contend with a=
 number of pending lawsuits.=20
"California is in for a long-term state of chaotic confusion," Jermain said=
. "It's such a complicated mess that you're going to have to let the court =
system play through."

Business
The Thing Is: Enron

11/11/2001
The Independent - London
FINAL

(Copyright 2001 Independent Newspapers (UK) Limited)

To investors who thought utilities were a slow but steady way to watch thei=
r money grow, Enron tells a particularly chilling tale of horror.=20
Even Friday's news that Enron's much smaller Houston neighbour, Dynergy, ma=
y be preparing to mount a $7bn (pounds 5bn) cash and stock bid did not mask=
 the grisly truth. As far as US fund managers are concerned, this is a comp=
any that let Wall Street down spectacularly. Dynergy is thought to have wai=
ted until then to be sure Moody's did not downgrade Enron's investment grad=
e to junk status.
The misery is doubled by the tempting image of what Enron could have been. =
At their peak almost a year ago, the shares gave the company a market value=
 of $69bn; on Friday they were worth a tenth of that.=20
The market felt there was good reason to push the stock to those heights. H=
ere was a company that had, for many years, appeared to make all the right =
moves. As the group transformed itself from a dull utility into an exciting=
 mix of energy trading, communications and services, it seemed never to put=
 a foot wrong. "You had such an outstanding and arrogant company," said Rog=
er Hamilton, a senior fund manager at John Hancock, "They were the giant. E=
verything in the energy industry touched Enron."=20
The company even managed to persuade investors its convoluted management st=
ructure, which some believe is the root cause of its demise, was a positive=
 thing. "You can't kiss the ass of 24 people," said former Enron chairman J=
effrey Skilling. "And together those 24 people are more likely to have the =
interests of the shareholders at heart than any one person."=20
Unfortunately, behind the scenes, all hell was breaking loose. The last cou=
ple of months have given the market a long, embarrassing string of revelati=
ons about the company it once cherished. The company has $13bn of outstandi=
ng debt, and has found its access to funds extremely limited. Two weeks ago=
, as a measure of its desperation, Enron had to secure a rescue loan agains=
t its 25,000- mile network of gas pipelines. Along the way, details of the =
group's botched expansion into India have made for supremely depressing ref=
lections on management. Crowning the whole sorry tale, and driving the shar=
es down 80 per cent, was the opening last month of a Securities and Exchang=
e Commission probe into the accounting for some of Enron's partnerships. La=
st week came the sacking of the group's treasurer and corporate lawyer, and=
 a revision of earnings for the last four years to the tune of half-a-billi=
on dollars.=20
Despite it all, Dynergy's bid could be the steal of the century. Until all =
its troubles are out in the open, Enron may be just a little too grimy for =
many potential buyers. But even the most bearish analysts can see there are=
 rich pickings from the old Enron empire. Dynergy's big problem is snapping=
 them up before the big boys, including Chevron or Shell, poach the good st=
uff.=20

USA: Wall Street takes aim at accounting tricks.
By Deepa Babington

11/11/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Nov 11 (Reuters) - Wall Street is starting to refuse to bite the =
bait on dubious earnings numbers highlighted by corporations in press relea=
ses.=20
Companies tout profit figures, frequently called pro forma results, that st=
rip out unseemly one-time charges and expenses at record levels - more than=
 $200 billion this year alone. Investors, analysts, and accountants are rev=
olting, and pressure is building to do away with the medley of different pr=
ofit numbers or at least cut down on it.
Standard & Poor's, a major compiler of earnings and other financial data, n=
ow will treat restructuring charges, stock option expenses, and write-downs=
 from ongoing operations as part of a company's operating earnings - items =
that many companies exclude from their version of operating earnings.=20
"In the past, S&P would take a company's special charges at their word," sa=
id S&P analyst Robert Friedman, who was involved in the project. "But now w=
e're going to say, 'Hey, wait a minute.'"=20
The decision underscores the momentum building on Wall Street to scrutinize=
 corporate accounting. One recent high-profile victim of this movement was =
Enron Corp. The energy trading company faced a crisis in investor confidenc=
e after it became clear it had boosted profits and racked up debt through c=
omplex financial transactions known as off-balance sheet deals.=20
The deals, which were structured so they wouldn't show up on Enron's balanc=
e sheet, caused Enron to chop almost $600 million off earnings for the last=
 four years. The once-mighty company lost $20 billion in market value, and =
on Friday agreed to be bought by smaller rival Dynegy Inc.=20
Investors are scared of such stock market casualties. That's partly why the=
y want to crack down on pro-forma numbers, which often present a much rosie=
r picture of a company's performance because they exclude a whole bevy of c=
osts that drag down the bottom line.=20
"Hopefully, this will put pressure on companies to think twice when they pu=
t out their financials," said Friedman.=20
Tech companies, in particular, conveniently have stripped out everything fr=
om inventory write-downs to severance costs from their bottom-line figures =
and pressured analysts to do the same with their earnings estimates.=20
Mobile phone maker Motorola Inc. , for example, reported a third-quarter pr=
o forma loss of $153 million early last month. After including charges for =
investment impairments, cost reduction activities and additional reserves f=
or its financing of a Turkish cellular operator, however, the company poste=
d a whopping $1.4 billion loss.=20
A Motorola spokesman was not available for comment.=20
The practice has also made it difficult for analysts and investors to compa=
re the results of one company against its peers as each comes up with its o=
wn ideas of what should be included in pro forma earnings.=20
"There are so many variants of pro forma that it can cloud comparisons," sa=
id David Zion, an accounting analyst at Bear Stearns.=20
The proliferation of these reports has also caught the attention of the nat=
ion's accounting rule makers, even though they don't have the authority to =
police press releases.=20
The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) two weeks ago said it is pr=
essing ahead with a project that will look at how some closely watched item=
s such as pension fund income should be classified and presented in financi=
al statements.=20
Corporate America was not enthused by the idea and several corporations wro=
te to the accounting body urging it not to go ahead with the plan, said the=
 project's senior manager, Ronald Bossio.=20
But fund managers and investors are applauding.=20
In a survey of 223 portfolio managers by capital markets firm Broadgate Con=
sultants, nine out of 10 stock pickers said companies need to improve how t=
hey report results. FASB needs to come up with one key indicator of financi=
al performance, and companies should abide by it, they basically said.=20
If the accounting rule-making body accepted EBITDA, or earnings before inte=
rest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as a key measure, companies oug=
ht to calculate it in a consistent manner and display it as a separate item=
 on their statements, almost all managers agreed.=20
"I think that pro forma thing is just a way to get around Generally Accepte=
d Accounting Principles," said Debra McNeill, a portfolio manager at Fremon=
t Investment Advisors. "I think there needs to be some guidelines to be set=
 out on pro forma numbers, but it does not necessarily need to be banned.

NEWS
Senate stimulus bill slammed as grab bag of special interests
JANET HOOK
Los Angeles Times

11/11/2001
Houston Chronicle

WASHINGTON - Watermelon growers. Filmmakers. Owners of electric cars. Commu=
ters in northern New Jersey. Those are among the people who would benefit f=
rom the fine print of a bill, in the Senate on Friday, to boost the languis=
hing U.S. economy.=20
The bill, on which a vote is expected this week, would pour about $70 billi=
on into the economy next year, mostly for extended unemployment benefits, h=
ealth insurance subsidies and tax breaks for individuals and businesses.
But it also includes a panoply of provisions less obviously connected to st=
imulating the economy - and more clearly designed to win support from speci=
fic senators.=20
In a last-minute concession to Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., the bill inc=
ludes bonding authority for Amtrak to develop high-speed railroads and for =
a new New York-New Jersey tunnel. More than $5 billion in agriculture subsi=
dies were grafted on to help shore up support of farm-state members.=20
The Senate Finance Committee approved the bill Thursday night on a party-li=
ne vote, but only after Republicans spent hours slamming it as a hodgepodge=
 of special-interest favors that will do little to strengthen the economy.=
=20
"This is a collage of political giveaways," said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas.=
=20
Sound familiar? That's because Democrats mounted a similar critique of the =
bill approved by the Republican-controlled House two weeks ago. Democrats a=
rgued that the House's $100 billion tax cut bill primarily would benefit so=
me of the biggest corporations in America, including Houston-based Enron Co=
rp. Rep. Martin Frost, D- Dallas, called it a "grab bag of special-interest=
 goodies."=20
The mudslinging on both sides illustrates a new line of argument that crops=
 up in debates all over Capitol Hill these days: The best way to attack you=
r opponents is to accuse them of trying to capitalize on the post-Sept. 11 =
sense of crisis to advance a parochial political agenda.=20
Sometimes the critique boomerangs. Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., a member of th=
e House Republican leadership, issued a statement Thursday attacking the Se=
nate Democrats' bill, saying, "The Senate's economic proposal focuses more =
on the excise tax for rum and other special-interest breaks than creating j=
obs."=20
He was referring to a Senate provision that would extend for one year an ex=
isting provision affecting rum imports. The problem with his argument, howe=
ver, is that the same provision is in the House Republican bill - which Wat=
ts supported.=20
That's just one of many provisions in both the House Republican and Senate =
Democratic bills that have little connection to economic stimulus; instead,=
 they extend a slew of tax breaks, routinely approved by Congress, which ar=
e about to expire.=20
At the White House, spokesman Ari Fleischer said the Senate bill contained =
"too much spending and not enough stimulus." He lambasted the $220 million =
in the bill for bison meat, eggplant, cauliflower and pumpkin growers - in =
essence, a government subsidy for commodities that have "experienced low pr=
ices during the 2000 or 2001 crop years." Thirty-four commodities would qua=
lify.=20
But Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus, D-Mont., said aid for the=
 ailing agricultural sector is an appropriate element of a recovery plan.=
=20
"When our national economy declines, rural areas are often among the areas =
that are hit the hardest and that recover slowest," Baucus said.=20
Another industry that could benefit from the Senate bill is the motion pict=
ure industry. Like the House bill, the Senate bill allows businesses more q=
uickly to write off their investments in assets whose value depreciates ove=
r a number of years. But unlike the House legislation, the Senate bill incl=
udes a provision specifying that films are a depreciable asset qualifying f=
or the tax break.
