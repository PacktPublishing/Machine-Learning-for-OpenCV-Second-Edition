There is no suitor-in-waiting for Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) .=20
Despite a speculation-filled week, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK=
A:NYSE - news - commentary) probably isn't waiting in the wings to gobble u=
p the troubled energy giant. The risk profile doesn't fit Royal Dutch Shell=
 (RD:NYSE - news - commentary) , and it's unlikely General Electric (GE:NYS=
E - news - commentary) is ready to jump at the chance to rescue the Houston=
 energy firm from its troubles with the SEC and disgruntled investors. ?And=
 while the recent slide in Enron's stock price might seem to make it an att=
ractive target, it's implausible that an Enron competitor would step up to =
the plate and make an offer to acquire its troubled peer. ?"We do not belie=
ve there is a high probability of a bailout offer at a price significantly =
above the current price, as there is too much uncertainty about the capital=
 structure and shareholder lawsuits," says Jeff Dietert, independent power =
analyst at Simmons & Co., a Houston energy investment firm and a member of =
the TSC Energy Roundtable. ?Many metrics suggest the stock is inexpensive. =
Merrill Lynch analyst Donato Eassey recently calculated Enron's asset value=
 to be between $16 and $24 per share, which may make Enron's current price =
of less than $12 look cheap. But in nearly the same breath, Eassey downgrad=
ed Enron stock to neutral from "accumulate." Merrill Lynch has provided ban=
king services for Enron. ?"While we have not altered our view of Enron's fu=
ndamentals or its ability to weather this long-term storm, from a practical=
 standpoint we believe noise surrounding the SEC's move to a formal investi=
gation will outweigh any [earnings] analysis or net asset value calculation=
," Eassey told clients in a report Thursday. ?For Buffett: Intriguing But .=
..?Reports that famed value investor Warren Buffett is looking at Enron may=
 be correct. He is an opportunistic investor and has an interest in the pow=
er business. And, Berkshire's ownership of Mid-American Energy provides a p=
latform for an Enron deal. ?However, interest and action are two different =
things. While Buffett has said he wants additional power holdings, he seems=
 more focused on the traditional, regulated utilities rather than the more =
aggressive opportunities represented by Enron. Buffett's track record shows=
 he craves certainty and that is something Enron can't provide, especially =
now. ?There are also pragmatic issues. If Enron considered a deal, it would=
 have to be one that was both rich and immediate, something Buffett can't o=
ffer. Constrained by the Public Utility Holding Company Act, or PUHCA, Berk=
shire might not be able to purchase Enron until the sale of Portland Genera=
l, the Oregon utility, is completed sometime next year. ?The Enron culture =
could also keep Buffett away. Enron is well known for its employee stock op=
tion program that made millions of dollars for people like ex-CEO Jeffrey S=
killing while creating little value for shareholders. Buffett is a tireless=
 critic of such shenanigans. Buffett also generally looks for companies wit=
h a management team committed to remaining in place, and Ken Lay has no des=
ire to remain at the helm of Enron for the long haul, and future leadership=
 is uncertain. ?And while Buffett still may take a look, price could be the=
 ultimate stumbling block. "I think he understands the derivative trading b=
usiness better than most," says Robert Hagstrom, portfolio manager of the L=
egg Mason Focus Trust and author of The Essential Buffett: Timeless Princip=
les for the New Economy. "I wouldn't be surprised if it's caught his eye, b=
ut I don't think he would get his price. He won't pay a premium for Enron."=
 ?As for Buffett, he won't comment on anything, let alone rumors like this.=
 ?Shell: Burned Out on Gas??Another rumored suitor is Royal Dutch Shell (RD=
:NYSE - news - commentary) . Speculation has escalated to the point of sugg=
esting that Shell and Enron have signed a confidentiality agreement to allo=
w for exchange of privileged financial data. ?A Shell spokeswoman in London=
 would not comment on the speculation. An Enron spokesman also declined to =
comment. ?Shell wants to expand its gas business and in its bid for Barrett=
 Resources, showed it will pay a premium for the right assets. ?But Enron i=
s more an energy trading company than an exploration and production company=
. Shell's problems growing both its Coral trading subsidiary and its Tejas =
Gas unit -- a costly acquisition -- probably would make it shy away from go=
ing there again, Dietert says. ?Shell and Enron are very different companie=
s, he adds. "Culturally, it's a tough deal to imagine." ?GE Capital: Enligh=
tened Investor??The final name bandied about is GE Capital. This one is mor=
e difficult to figure, but an investment in Enron by the finance unit of Ge=
neral Electric isn't out of the question. However, sources tell me an outri=
ght bid is unlikely. ?"They are a potential investor," says Dietert. "If pu=
sh comes to shove, Enron would be willing to issue 30% to 40% more equity r=
ather than face bankruptcy. And, GE Capital could participate in such a dea=
l." ?However, any move is just speculation at this point. And General Elect=
ric won't comment on speculation. ?Even if an offer for Enron emerged, pric=
e would clearly be an issue. Current uncertainty suggests any offer would b=
e well below a price Enron would consider reasonable. Hence, while a bid fo=
r Enron isn't out of the question, it's likely Enron will stand to fight it=
s current battles alone. ???BANDWIDTH BEAT: Playing '20 Questions' With Enr=
on Execs?By Michael Rieke??11/02/2001?Dow Jones Energy Service?(Copyright (=
c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)??A Dow Jones Newswires Column ??HOUSTON=
 -(Dow Jones)- Since Enron Corp. (ENE) is such a hot topic these days, here=
's a suggestion for a new game.?If you worked for the Securities and Exchan=
ge Commission, with its subpoena powers, what questions would you ask in yo=
ur current investigation of Enron? ?You could even break it down into categ=
ories, like the game show "Jeopardy." ?The first category is Enron trading =
counterparties run by Enron executives. ?How many of those counterparties w=
ere run by Enron employees such as former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fa=
stow and Michael Kopper, a former managing director of Enron's Global Equit=
y Markets Group? ?We know that Fastow ran two private investment companies =
that Enron traded with - LJM Cayman and LJM2 Cayman. Kopper ran one called =
Chewco Investments ?What does LJM stand for? (If you know that answer to th=
at one, you're ahead of an Enron spokeswoman who told Bandwidth Beat that s=
he didn't know what the letters stood for.) ?Sometimes companies use letter=
s that are actually initials of investors names. Are any of the investors i=
n the LJM partnerships an Enron executive whose last name starts with L, J =
or M? (The Enron spokeswoman hasn't called back with an answer to that one =
either.) ?Who was meant to profit and who was meant to lose in Enron's comp=
licated financial transactions with the LJM partnerships and others? ?If th=
e partnerships were meant to profit, what will Enron's shareholders (and th=
eir class-action lawsuit attorneys) have to say about it? ?If Enron was mea=
nt to profit from the transactions, was it because the deals allowed the co=
mpany to hide underperforming assets, making its quarterly reports look bet=
ter? If the answer to that question is yes, what will Enron's shareholders =
(and their class-action lawsuit attorneys) have to say about it? ?A related=
 category might be geography. Start with an easy one: In what body of water=
 are the Cayman Islands located? ?Then move to more interesting questions. =
Why were the two LJM private investment partnerships located in the Caymans=
? Does it have anything to do with the fact that the Caymans are a tax-free=
 jurisdiction even for non-residents? Does it have anything to do with the =
strict confidentiality laws governing business transactions there? ?The nex=
t category is politics. Again, start with an easy one: How much money did E=
nron Chairman Ken Lay give to George W. Bush's presidential campaign fund? =
(That one is easy because, by law, the limit is $1,000 per person for hard =
money contributions.) ?How much soft money did Lay and Enron each give to t=
he Republican Party during the 1999-2000 campaign cycle? ?How much did Lay =
give to Bush's presidential primary campaign fund? (That one is more diffic=
ult. Bush decided not to accept government matching funds for his primary c=
ampaign, so there wasn't any limit on individual contributions.) ?How much =
money did Ken Lay help raise for Bush's presidential primary campaign? (Her=
e's a hint: He was a member of the Bush Pioneers, each of whom pledged to r=
aise at least $100,000 for the fund.) ?Still in the politics category, how =
much will those campaign contributions affect the current SEC investigation=
 of Enron? (That's another easy one. All contributors to political campaign=
s will tell you that they expect nothing in return.) ?Now for the history c=
ategory. In an April conference call with analysts, who was the analyst who=
 criticized Enron for not disclosing enough information about its finances?=
 ?What expletive did Enron's former Chief Executive Jeff Skilling call the =
analyst? (Here's a hint: In reporting the name-calling incident, a radio ne=
wsman said Skilling had "called the analyst a type of hole.") ?At the time,=
 Skilling said the analyst was a "short-seller." That means the analyst had=
 borrowed Enron stock and sold it, expecting the share price to decline ove=
r time. He then would buy it back at a lower price and make a profit. ?If t=
hat investment strategy qualified the analyst to be called a particular typ=
e of hole, what do you call the Enron executives who have sold more than $5=
00 million in company shares since Jan. 1, 2000? ?In answering that questio=
n, remember that short-sellers have to buy the stock back at some point in =
order to make money. Also remember that the Enron executives didn't have to=
 buy back any of the stock they sold. ?Join in the fun. If you want to play=
 and have questions to add to the list, refer to the e-mail address and pho=
ne number below. ?-By Michael Rieke, Dow Jones Newswires; 713-547-9207; mic=

?By Leonard Anderson??11/02/2001?Reuters English News Service?(C) Reuters L=
imited 2001.??SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 2 (Reuters) - If there's one market that m=
ight applaud the mounting financial woes facing energy giant Enron Corp., i=
t's California, whose power sector was shattered by the market deregulation=
 that Enron tirelessly champions. ?Last summer, angry Californians tossed a=
 pie at Enron ex-Chief Executive Jeff Skilling during a speech here in whic=
h he blamed state regulators for causing the energy crisis.?California offi=
cials, led by Governor Gray Davis, blasted Houston-based Enron and other ou=
t-of-state power companies for creating the emergency, accusing them of man=
ipulating the market and jacking up prices. ?But with Enron now facing a cr=
edit crunch and a full-scale probe by U.S. regulators into questionable fin=
ancial dealings, California officials are holding back their harshest criti=
cism, saying instead there are lessons to be learned from Enron's predicame=
nt. ?And some of Enron's toughest critics, among them Davis and Loretta Lyn=
ch, president of the state's Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), would not =
discuss the company's woes. ?"You reap what you sow, but I don't think anyo=
ne wants to pile on them right now," said a state government source. ?Many =
Californians cited ongoing business and creditor links with Enron as reason=
s not to hurl stones at the energy giant. ?Enron is by far the nation's lar=
gest trader of electricity and natural gas, with energy analysts estimating=
 it is involved in some 25 percent of daily trade in those markets. ?Transa=
ctions on the company's widely watched Internet-based EnronOnline trading s=
ystem are estimated currently to average $3 billion to $4 billion a day. ?'=
BUSINESS CYCLES' ?"Business cycles come and go," said Greg Pruett, spokesma=
n for San Francisco-based energy company PG&E Corp. , whose Pacific Gas & E=
lectric unit, California's biggest utility, filed for federal bankruptcy pr=
otection in April in the wake of the energy mess. ?"We are wrestling with o=
ur own situation, and you can appreciate what Enron is going through. We ha=
ve done business with Enron for a long time and will continue to do busines=
s with them in the future," Pruett said. ?California's power agencies, forc=
ed into buying emergency electricity for the state earlier this year when t=
he state's investor-owned utilities ran out of credit and cash, said they h=
ave financial ties with Enron. ?"Their situation is not ringing alarm bells=
 for us," said Gregg Fishman, a spokesman for the Independent System Operat=
or (ISO), which manages the state power grid. ?The ISO owes Enron money for=
 purchases of daily power supplies but Fishman declined to say how much. ?A=
side from a 30-day supply contract earlier this year, Enron does not have a=
ny current power deals with the state's Department of Water Resources, said=
 Oscar Hidalgo, spokesman for the agency which negotiates long-term agreeme=
nts. ?One top California energy regulator, however, said Enron's troubles o=
ffer an important lesson for energy markets. ?Carl Wood, a CPUC commissione=
r, said the deregulation of markets for basic services like electricity "th=
reatens as much financial volatility and instability as we have seen in the=
 telecommunications and the dot-com industries." ?Wood said, "Enron is the =
flagship for deregulation, but there are definite dangers of venturing into=
 unregulated market behavior. Enron itself apparently is becoming a victim =
of sorts. Our largest utility is in bankruptcy. One obvious conclusion is t=
o keep the energy industry on a pretty short regulatory leash." ?"The unreg=
ulated energy industry rises faster, but it also falls further," said Doug =
Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayers and Consumer Rights, an advocacy gro=
up in Santa Monica, California. ?"It's okay for a free market to operate fo=
r things like computers and other goods but energy is different. Regulatory=
 structures are needed to protect customers," he said.??Copyright ? 2000 Do=

Seen Going Smoothly This Time?By Jessica Berthold?Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES??1=
1/02/2001?Dow Jones Energy Service?(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company=
, Inc.)??LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp's (ENE) current troubles won'=
t jeopardize its $1.8 billion sale of utility Portland General Electric to =
Northwest Natural Gas Co. (NWN), analysts and the companies said. ?In contr=
ast to Enron's previous attempt to sell the utility to Sierra Pacific Resou=
rces (SRP), which foundered earlier this year on regulatory issues, the sal=
e to the Portland, Ore.-based gas utility is expected to go smoothly.?It wi=
ll need to, as Enron has said it is counting on sales of assets, including =
Portland General, to pay off $3.3 billion in notes coming due during the ne=
xt 20 months. ?"Enron has wanted out of this asset for a very long time," s=
aid Susan Abbott, an analyst with Moody's Investor Services. "Right now, th=
ey need to sell some assets, and this would be a larger one that would give=
 them some cash." ?The energy giant's shares have lost about two-thirds of =
their value in the past three weeks and its credit ratings have been downgr=
aded to within two steps of noninvestment grade levels due to uncertainties=
 about its extremely complex financial structure. ?Those uncertainties were=
 sparked Enron's $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity related to tr=
ansactions with entities headed by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fa=
stow. The notes coming due are also related to those entities. Enron's deal=
ings with those entities are the subject of an investigation by the Securit=
ies and Exchange Commission, and have raised investor hackles over a percei=
ved lack of transparency. ?Analysts said none of this will change plans for=
 the Portland General sale - which will bring Enron $1.55 billion in cash, =
$200 million in Northwest Natural Gas preferred stock, and $50 million in c=
ommon stock. ?Earlier Problems Not Seen Repeated ??In April, a two-year old=
 deal to sell the utility to Nevada company Sierra Pacific Resources (SRP) =
for $2 billion collapsed due to changes in that state's laws that would hav=
e forbidden the utility's recovery of power costs if the sale went through.=
 The deal had already been doomed for months due to Sierra Pacific's tenuou=
s financial position. ?But Northwest Natural's financial house is in order,=
 and there is no apparent law or regulation that threatens to block the dea=
l in Oregon or Washington, the two states where approval is needed, analyst=
s said. ?"Northwest Natural is very well-regarded by regulators in both sta=
tes, and I think there's quite a bit of interest on the part of regulators =
to have the utility in local hands as opposed to somewhere down in Texas," =
said Gerald Keenan, utility analyst for PricewaterhouseCoopers. ?Concerns a=
bout the quality of Enron's credit may encourage state regulators to act mo=
re quickly on the sale, an analyst said. ?"If I were a regulator, I'd be mu=
ch more interested in having Portland General out from under Enron," the an=
alyst said. ?The Oregon Public Utilities Commission hopes to expedite its r=
eview of the sale so that it is complete in six months, rather than the usu=
al 10, commission spokesman Bob Valdez said. ?"Given the fact that we are f=
amiliar with the management and regulatory affairs of both companies and ha=
ve dealt with them extensively, we hope it will take no longer than six mon=
ths," said Valdez, adding that the commission expected to receive a filing =
on the sale Nov. 7. ?The Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission=
 hasn't received a filing, but once it does there is no statutory time limi=
t on review, a spokeswoman said. ?Federal Review Seen Uneventful ??In addit=
ion to Oregon and Washington utilities regulators, the sale must be approve=
d by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the U.S. Securities and Exch=
ange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of Justi=
ce and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. ?None has received filings y=
et on the sale, which is slated for completion in the fourth quarter of 200=
2. ?"We are shooting for mid-November as far as submitting our request to t=
he state commissions," Northwest Natural Gas spokesman Steve Sechrist said.=
 "Those will be the first major hurdle, then we'll move on to the federal f=
ilings." ?Shareholders must also approve the acquisition. They will likely =
vote in spring of 2002, Sechrist said. ?Northwest Natural, Enron and analys=
ts said they don't expect hangups at the federal level. ?The only thing tha=
t might create a problem for the sale, Keenan said, would be a "significant=
 deterioration" of the natural gas or electricity markets harming the compa=
nies. Right now, however, things look good on that front. ?"The market is m=
uch more stable than it was when Sierra Pacific tried to buy the utility. A=
nd the deal is much more practical this time: the price is lower and the te=
rms are better," he said. "Clearly it's important for Enron to be able to g=
et this done, and I think they will." ?-By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones News=

York Mercantile Exchange, the world's largest energy futures marketplace, s=
aid Friday it lowered the cost of exchange-of-futures-for-swaps transaction=
s retroactive to Thursday, when the new instruments were introduced. ?In a =
press release Friday, Nymex said it cut the cost of EFS transactions to $2.=
50 a contract per side from $10 a contract per side.?The exchange introduce=
d the contracts in its natural gas futures market Thursday, in a move the t=
rading community saw as an attempt by Nymex to grab market share from Enron=
 Corp. (ENE) by extending its clearing services to the over-the-counter mar=
ket for natural gas derivatives. ?Enron, which accounts for about 25% of th=
e trade in U.S. power and gas markets, has seen its creditworthiness questi=
oned as a result of complicated financial dealings that led to a $1.2 billi=
on writedown of shareholder equity, a 65% drop in the company's stock in tw=
o weeks and an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. ?In=
 the first full day of trading on Nymex, 11,000 EFS contracts changed hands=
, Nymex said. ?EFS transactions are similar to exchange-of-futures-for-phys=
icals, or EFP, transactions. Two parties will privately negotiate integrate=
d over-the-counter swaps and a related futures transaction. The transaction=
 must involve approximately equal, but opposite, side-of-market quantities =
of futures and swap exposures in commodities that are similar or related. ?=
The EFS transactions will be allowed to liquidate, initiate and transfer ma=
rket positions between the two parties involved in the transaction. ?-By An=
