Is Enron ready for this?  I think it is a good suggestion for the most significant deals.  It is really positive in that it would force dealmakers to pay more attention to what the contracts provide.  I am not sure it makes sense to follow this procedure for every deal that is dashed.  Let's talk about what are the objectives.  Great question!

We have spoken about this before, the issue is that Enron Americas has no approval mechanism for contracts. Neither does any other group but that is not my problem.  I have spent too much time reading DASH forms which really do not provide full authorization.

There are two suggestions that I would like to be implemented:

(i) DASH forms need to include all of the contracts which are to be signed under the deal.  So if a DASH is signed then this authorizes all of the contracts to be signed in the deal.  Any contracts which are not included need to go through the process outlined below.

(ii) All contracts need a Contract Approval Form attached and Enron's legal team cannot initial any contract until this form has been completed (ie signed) by the following Enron staff.

Trader/Originator ________________________________
Head of Group (VP or above)______________________
Credit__________________________________________
Legal__________________________________________
Tech Services (where applicable)__________________
Commercial Support (where applicable)_____________

A database of all completed contracts on behalf of Enron Americas needs to be maintained by Legal.

Thoughts please?
