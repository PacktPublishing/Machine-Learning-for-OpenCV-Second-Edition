I don't suppose you have any interest in meeting them - but I thought I would offer.

Marcus and Louise

How are you?  I hope all is well and I wanted to let you know that I will be
in Houston at the end of next week with, probably, a couple of my colleagues
and I wondered if you might have any time to get together.

Depending on schedules, I should be with Alan Jowett who is head of our
energy practice, Stephane Brabant who heads our civil law energy practice in
Paris and Ralf Thaeter who leads the energy practice of Gleiss Lutz, the
German firm with whom we have a formal relationship.

We should be around from late on Wednesday 4th April until late afternoon on
Friday 6th April and it would be splendid if we were able to get some time
with you and, if you thought it appropriate, any of your colleagues who
would be interested to meet us.

Could I trouble you to let me know if there are any times that would suit?

Best wishes

Paul

PS We finished a NETA-related deal opposite an Enron team led by Ali Lloyd
and Paul Simons at about 1.30 am on Tuesday!

Paul
