Louise, attached is the draft resolution. As you can see, there are some missing blanks that need to be filled in. Please let me know if you can handle for us. Thanks, Kelly

Hi Rebecca.  My commercial team says the special EC mtg. has been set for Monday a.m., March 12.  Is that correct?  They are finalizing the DASH and presentation today, and will be sending those to you.  Are the below form of resolutions ok?  I'm at (503)464-8692 if you need to reach me. Thanks.  --  Karen

Rebecca,
Attached for your review and input are draft resolutions.  The DASH and presentation are still in process by our commercial team, but we will forward those along to you just as soon as they are ready.

I don't set a date for the meeting until someone has a deadline.  All the current deals are still pending but no one has specified a deadline.

Hi Rebecca.  Is it possible yet to pin down a more certain time frame for our upcoming special mtg?  We've got a lot of moving pieces (I'm sure you've heard that one before!), so it would greatly help in our planning.

I'll be in my office tomorrow (Wed) - (503)464-8692.  Thanks.
