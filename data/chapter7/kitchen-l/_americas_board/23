The next BOD and Committee meetings will be held on April 30-May 1.

Rebecca Carter has set the deadline for commercial groups to submit agenda items to her office and to Rick Buy as Wednesday, April 18.  I will forward her notification memo sent to the commercial teams once it is distributed.

Please contact me as soon as possible if you know of anything that has a possibility to be added to the Finance Committee Agenda.  All presentations as approved by Rebecca Carter, fully executed DASHes and Legal Resolutions should be turned in to us by Friday, April 20.  The mailout date and final cutoff is Tuesday, April 24.
