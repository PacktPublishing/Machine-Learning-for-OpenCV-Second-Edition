Louise,

As discussed, the Austin project  shows as a negative because the project was positive cash until mid-June. The City of Austin paid ENA in advance of the project costs actually being incurred.  By the end of this quarter, the Austin Project will have a positive asset balance of $750K to $1million.

The "Global Assets (Cuiaba & BBPL)on EA's books" line relates to development and reimbursable costs that were not moved over with the MTM piece.  While these costs were being transferred to G.A., a reimbursement was actually received for part of the BBPL costs.  Since we had moved the costs, the payment caused us to have a negative balance at May 31.  This is currently being reconciled and the balance will be $0 at quarter-end.

Call if you need more information.
Regards
Jody
