Yes. $300mm will be used on Sept 29th to repay the $300mm principal amount due associated with the financing executed last year to purchase the Alberta PPA. It was already figured in the plan.

Rob in Canada is sitting in $300mm in his bank account. Does this count towards our cash targets - did you know it existed?

Have a good week-end
