I am NOT taking the P/L swings or funding this investment.  If there is confusion, let's get together with Dave.

We have the AIG Highstar Fund in ENA.  As I understand it ENA committed to $12.5M on this with the other 50% coming from EE&CC.  I understand from Dave that you are taking the P&L swings on this fund.  As they are about to pull further on this money (<1m to date), I wondered how you wanted it treating.

Let's discuss
