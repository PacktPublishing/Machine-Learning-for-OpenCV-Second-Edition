I will follow up with Wes to see if it is already in the plan. I also have a call into Rob to inquire if he has any needs for the excess cash either in the short or long term. Depending on the response, I will get with Steve Douglas to look at ways of getting the cash back to the US for debt repayment in the most tax efficient manner. Thanks for the heads up.
