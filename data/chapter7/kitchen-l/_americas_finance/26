Market Update

The market has opened with a weak tone this morning given the collapse in
equity futures - Dow futures down 408, S&P down 29 and NASDAQ down 40 - and
the collapse of some recent new issues in the secondary market.  IBM printed
a $1.5bn five year yesterday at T+117 that just traded at T+130.  What is
leading the collapse in spreads?  BAS has several observations:

* The absolute level of Treasury yields will continue to result in new issue
supply that is priced at ever widening new issue premiums.  Most issuers are
more coupon sensitive than spread sensitive and, as a result, will be
willing to pay a large new issue concession given the attractive level of
overall coupons.

* Although we have not seen it yet in the corporate bond market, an inverted
credit curve is not out of the question given the steepness of the Treasury
curve.  Two and three year securities in particular, almost need to be
priced on a coupon basis.

* The technicals of the market are beginning to deteriorate.  Insurance
companies, traditionally the largest buyer of long assets, appetite for new
product may begin fade as claim estimates climb.  Balanced funds, may need
to begin selling to rebalance portfolios given the meltdown in the equity
market.  The dealer community and the buyside is trying to hold on to market
gains for the year.

Despite the negative tone, BAS feels that issuers in the energy sector will
continue to have access to the primary market in the near-term (albeit at
wider spreads) due to the defensive nature of the sector and the absolute
implosion of other sectors (autos, media, lodging, retail, airlines, etc).  

Please do not hesitate to call should you have any questions on the state of
the current marketplace.
