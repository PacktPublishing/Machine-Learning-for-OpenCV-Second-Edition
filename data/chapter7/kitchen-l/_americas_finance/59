Please read and focus on the Seller (ENA) Representations and Warranties contained in Section 4.1 [especially those that pertain to your area of expertise/involvement in the various Alamac/Cogentrix/NCPH/AIG transactions] and review the corresponding Schedules of disclosed exceptions, in preparation for this afternoon's meeting.

Because Enron North America Corp. will be signing the Securities Purchase Agreement tomorrow, Friday, May 11, 2001, IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE RECEIVE YOUR INPUT AT TODAY'S 3:00 MEETING.  If you are out of town or will be unable to attend the meeting for any other reason, please conference in per the instructions contained below, or call me before 3:00 today at 3-7238 with you input.
