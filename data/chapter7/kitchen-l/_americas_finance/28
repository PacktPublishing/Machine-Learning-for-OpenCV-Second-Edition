Re canada: rob is predicting $462mm canadian cash balance for year end. Approx half is due to organic cash flow. The rest is a byproduct of slapshot. I've got a call into wes to see if these numbers were in the 2nd current estimate or not. I've talked with stephen douglas about getting the cash back early through a repurchase of the preferred shares ecc issued to corp earlier this year. I should have more info by our mtg this afternoon.
