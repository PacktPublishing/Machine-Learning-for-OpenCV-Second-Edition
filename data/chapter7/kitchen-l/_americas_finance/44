Ranabir Dutt, a VP in my group, will not be attending the offsite. Ranabir is currently in Bombay working Dabhol from the finance side and is not expected back until the 23rd at the earliest. Just wanted to give a heads up for rooming/activities scheduling purposes. Thanks.

Please find attached details for the forthcoming Enron Americas Management Offsite. There are group actions which need to be completed before arriving in Beaver Creek. 
The Offsite will involve meetings, mountain biking and white water rafting (grade 3), so please bring appropriate clothing. For those who have not been rafting before appropriate clothing would be swimwear, sports shoes, hat, shorts and T-shirt. Life jackets will be provided. The accommodation will be in condominiums in Beaver Creek and room assignments are also attached below. 
Transportation 
The attached agenda outlines the transportation requirements for those departing from Houston. It is assumed that all members of the ESA team will also travel to and from Houston with the Houston based employees. Dorie Hitchcock will be contacting those of you separately who are not traveling to and from Houston. 
Video 
You each have been assigned to a group for the sole purpose of completing a video prior to attending the Offsite. The video filming should be completed and on a VHS tape prior to departure for Beaver Creek. The purpose of this video is to provide a comic interlude to the proceedings. The videos will be seen prior to dinner on Friday night at Saddleridge. The video should be about  5 minutes in length, on a VHS tape and there is a zero budget assigned to the production of the video. Each team has been given a title which is open to interpretation (see attached spreadsheet).
Please find attached the following information: 
(i) Attendees and Teams for Video 
(ii) Draft Agenda 
Any questions or concerns should be addressed to Dorie Hitchcock (Ext 36978) 
We look forward to seeing you in Beaver Creek. 
John & Louise
