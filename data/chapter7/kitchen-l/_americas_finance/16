Joe,
We are looking at this again. There seem to be even bigger issues than accounting with the regional ERC's, such as limited liquidity and trading volumes, extremely long transfer times for the local issuing authority to change title, etc. Then, of course, Barclay's has to agree to take them. We will push hard internally to get them in; then start working on Barclays when we have a strong story. I am not optimistic, but I do feel the pressure that you are under. Shankman and McConnell called me in to tell me what you told me last week - get all inventory off ASAP. I recommend that we nail down the SO2 extension before pushing Barclays on other products. Is that OK with you?
Jim
