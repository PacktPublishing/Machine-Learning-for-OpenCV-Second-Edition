Louise & John:
We have just recently completed a three year storage transaction with Centana Stg.  The demand charge is around $108,00 each month.  We are currently filling the storage with plans to inject 500,000 MMbtu in September and October.  This would mean cash payments for gas of around $1,250,000 in October and the same in November.

	Jim

Subject:	End of quarter Funds Flow Targets

As we approach the end of the quarter we are closely monitoring our funds flow targets for Enron Americas.  We would like you to let us know if you are planning to enter into any transactions within your groups which will impact those targets, either positively or negatively.  We would like information on all deals which impact significantly our funds flow targets prior to you entering into them.  Please note that this is not just structured transactions but even a storage transaction where we would be injecting would involve cash going out of Enron.

Enron's cash liquidity position is very strong and there is not an issue of whether or not we enter into a transaction but we must ensure we correctly price any transactions and indeed send clear signals to the orginators and traders with regards to our funds flow targets.

Please let John or Louise know if you have any transactions which may occur with funds flow implications.  Should you need any indications of pricing, please contact Joe Deffner.

Louise & John
