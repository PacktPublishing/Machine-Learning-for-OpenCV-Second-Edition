Joe:

We have got the OPIC board approval for a $190 mm project finance loan to Eletrobolt.  Attached is a press release that OPIC would like to release related to the project.  Our's in one of three projects.  This press release has been reviewed by the PR group (Keith Miceli).  OPIC expects to release it later today or tomorrow.
