Had conf calls with godfrey, lamb and mitchell on indian mesa 2. I have a quick meeting with legal on interpreting the contract ambiguity re curtailment this morning and can fill you in on all those discussions shortly. BBB+/BBB- issue needs another followup today and hopefully can be put away. Also, re the cashflow from canada. Suspicion is approx 40% is due from ena to ecc so it might get washed out in the consolidated ea reporting. Wes's team comparing ecc's proj financials to what was included for ecc in the current estimate.
