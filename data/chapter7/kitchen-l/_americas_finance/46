Investment in AIG on balance sheet:

EEOS   $914,107   
ENA       914,107
          ------------------
          $1,828,214  (fundings made in 12\00 and 2\01)

Fair Value of Alamac investment on ENA's books: $22,000,000

Origination taken on original FV mark = $14,522,411 (50\50 ENA and EIM)*

*Issue: In the 1Q origination we built up the "basis" for certain capital improvements and the expected net operating loss of the plant through APRIL, which was the anticipated sale date to AIG.  We now have the actual losses through 6\30 to deal with.  I will send you a separate schedule with the details but basically we are looking @ $1.2 Million that needs to be shared with EIM.  These losses do not automatically flow there as NCPH is an unconsolidated entity.

Estimated upside on power option $1.7 Million (on hotlist for 3Q)  Premium coming to us is around $3.5 Million. (?)

PV of coal supply deal on EGM's books is $4,325,000 asset.
