Louise, given the number of declines, is there any latitude in moving up the Canadian Headcount. I believe we cut very deep on the 1st go round. Specifically, there is  a couple of analysts and one manager on the commercial side and on the non-commercial side we'd like to have at least one if not two admins for answering the phones (Admins are roughly U.S. $15K/annum and ours are extremely good). We still might come in under our initial headcount given the decline probabilities, but I would like to offer additional jobs asap as opposed to waiting for responses.
