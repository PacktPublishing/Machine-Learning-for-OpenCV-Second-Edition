Louise,

1) Has there been any resolution on whether we focus on marketing UBSenergy vs. UBSWenergy?

2) Is our launch date confirmed for Jan 29? (did you find out the actual date of filing for Hart-Scott?)

3) I am chasing the final, punctuation-correct name for the contracting party for GTC, ETA and PA purposes, but as yet do not have a definitive answer. 

4) I am also chasing Articles of Incorporation so we can proceed with the Verisign application.

Dave
