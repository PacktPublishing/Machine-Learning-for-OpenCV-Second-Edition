Louise -- The spin for the [Netco] press announcement(s) can take many different directions.  As a start, Dave and I have taken a stab at writing the attached draft of the press release for the buyer to revise, approve and issue.  The release promotes the buyer's purchase of [Netco] and the launch of [NetcoOnline].  Please review and let me or Dave know if you'd like to discuss.  I have not shown this to Enron Corp.'s PR or legal groups yet.  Thanks.

Kal
