I sent revisions to the FAQ's and the cover letter to Kal Shah and
Leslie Hansen last night.  Kal assures me that all of the changes I
suggested (including the deletion of any mention of ubswenergy other
than as part of a web address) were being made.  Accordingly, I think
the message is getting through.  Also, in conversations with Mark
Taylor, I stressed that no trademark registration was to be made,
pointing out that the use of the url was intended to be temporary.
Mark had not had anything to do with a possible registration of the
mark, other than receiving a phone mail message.

We will see how things go, however, I believe the message has gotten
through for now.

The broader issue perhaps is that they appear to be naming/branding
the
on-line trading system UBSWenergy and using that as a marketing name
for their business.  For example, I had heard they wanted to
trademark
the term.  Even if they have approval to use the website name
temporarily, does it make sense to go out with a marketing name that
might be killed in 6 months - and for which we may not have approval
to
trademark?  Maybe not a popular position if Costas is behind this -
but
we should be sure everyone is clear on the possible ramifications.

Just so you know, there are some intellectual property considerations
behind this.  In order to best protect the UBS and UBS Warburg names,
group does not like us to weaken them by using UBSW.

this is the response that we have just received from group marketing.
all relaunch efforts have now had to be put on hold as switzerland
control the naming of the DNS servers.  pls could John or Mike put in
an urgent call to Heidi Baumann to square this one away.

fyi - the individual in UBSW Comms & Marketing who originally signed
off this request (Stuart Hepburn) has since left the bank.

thx
Ursula

Hi Isabelle,

On behalf of group marketing (Heidi Baumann) I have to reject this
request:

- www.ubswenergy.com must not be visible (but may be used as a hidden
technical
url).
- e.g. "www.ubw-w.com/energy" would be OK or old-style:
"www.ubsw.com/energy.

Hi Judit, hi Robert

We set the DNS servers temporarily on what the customer ordered as it
seems to
be very time critical. It should be seen on the internet by tomorrow
at
latest.

Nevertheless this activation needs to be signed-off. Please do so
asap.
and
reply to hostmaster@ubs.com

Thanks, Rgds,

Subject: ubswenergy.com: Changing authoritative servers



It is crucial that the DNS servers for ubswenergy.com be set as
follows (as soon as possible):

 dns0-ext.ubswenergy.com        192.216.57.100
 dns1-ext.ubswenergy.com        192.216.57.101

It is entirely possible that the names dns0-ext.ubswenergy.com
and dns1-ext.ubswenergy.com will be rejected because the
IP addresses associated with those names are already associated with
dns0-ext.enrononline.com and dns1-ext.enrononline.com.  If this is
the case, it will be necessary to use the enrononline.com domain
names
for the DNS servers and then change the server names later, once
ubswenergy is on-line and ready.  As long as the servers provide
information about both domains, this should be possible.
