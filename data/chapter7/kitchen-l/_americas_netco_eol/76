We are getting ready for the launch of "NetcoOnline".

We have been preparing new documentation, a refreshed site design and cleaned products to reflect our Gas and Power focus.

Our planned Re-Launch timetable is as follows:


Week of Jan 14:

Upon approval by the new buyer of the PA and ETA formats, we will contact our Top 50 customers and send them copies of the final PA and ETA forms with the new Buyer's name filled in. During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have an approved PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch "NetCoOnline".

A Splash page will be available within two business days of knowing our new company name, on a web page reached via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of "NetCoOnline" and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Subusers.

A Press Release will be issued which will include the planned launch date of "NetcoOnline"

Week of Jan. 21:

If all goes well, "NetcoOnline" will be launched on Tuesday, January 22, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues).

We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for NetcoOnline. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
		
Trading/Origination Coordination

We will shortly be sending you an invitation to join a meeting in which we will be discussing launch plans in more detail and looking for people to help in contacting customers on our Top 50 list. Although we have a dedicated EnronOnline marketing team, we would appreciate assistance from traders and originators who have strong relationships with our customers and can assist in getting signed PA's returned to us.

If you have any questions please contact Bob Shults (30397) or Dave Forster (31861).
