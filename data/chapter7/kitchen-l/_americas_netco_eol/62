Louise,

I think I may have made an error in selecting Heather over Erica for UBS. It has become apparant that, though she has kept a lower profile, Erica has made a larger contribution to the system and has a broader skillset than Heather's.

Accordingly, I would like to exchange these two for receiving an offer letter. If I am able to do this on the UBS side, do you object?

Please advise as soon as you can.

Thanks,

Dave
