Louise -- FYI.  I received the following e-mail from UBS.  I think their IT group is putting together some recommendations for the domain name.  It seems UBS has registered 1)ubswenergy.com 2) ubswarburgenergyonline.com 3)ubswarburgenergy.com and 4) ubswenergyonline.com.  I know you registered UBSENERGY.COM.  I like that over the ones UBS registered.  As we get closer, I'll assume I'll find out which domain name is approved for the launch.  

Thanks

Kal

I agree that we need to have some options ready for the domain name and any corporate guidelines on this would be helpful. I also have some ideas and a plan for driving traffic to the new site in the first few weeks.   Please feel free to call me if you need my help or if I can clarify anything.  My contact numbers are:

Hey Penny

Need your help urgently to pull together a short one or two pager for 
us to present to the business first thing tomorrow.  The one urgent 
issue that has not yet been resolved in regards to migration of enron 
systems is the domain name and how we direct traffic to the site.  Jim 
has registered the domain names below, in the absence of any direction 
from the business.  

To give a bit of context, the site will contain power & gas trading and 
third party feeds.  It will not have any intermingled content with the 
rest of client portal.  It will have its own electronic client 
contracts and disclaimers.  It will have a distinct team responsible 
for allocating client passwords, assigning entitlements, ehelp, etc.  
So in summary the whole site will be run and managed completely 
separately from rest of corp & institutional content.

I have copied Kal Shah on this email, who is the business person 
responsible for rebranding EOL.

So I guess the paper needs to cover the following:

1.	Branding decision (need to provide a high level summary of 
corporate center guidelines to tell the business what they should and 
shouldn't do in terms of domain names etc).  Need to refer to the names 
already registered below, but indicate that we can register any name we 
like.

2.	Options for client access to NetCo web site (ubswarburg.com or 
ubswarburg.com\domain_name or client portal\domain_name or 
ubswarburg.com\clientportal\domain_name or whatever

3.	Similar options we need to consider for internal access by 
traders

4.	What else????


any chance i can have a first draft by 2pm UK on Tuesday????

Thx honey
Ursula
