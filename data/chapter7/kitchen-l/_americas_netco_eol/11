Just a quick heads-up:

UBS is intending to give everyone in Houston an email address in the format: firstname.lastname.ubswenergy.com.

Obviously, this conflicts a bit in that we are promoting the online system as ubswenergy.com.

I don't see this as a huge issue, but wanted you to know before it happens.
