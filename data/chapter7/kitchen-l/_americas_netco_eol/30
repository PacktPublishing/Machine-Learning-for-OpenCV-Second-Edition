Louise,

1) I just received a call from Pat O'Donnell asking us to hold off on marketing to the Top 50 customers until he is able to address an email he just received from UBS corporate marketing folks, instructing us not to use the url: www.ubswenergy.com. It seems they want us to use www.ubswarburg.com/energy. Pat is going to argue on behalf of ubswenergy.com tomorrow. He anticipates having resolution by noon. I personally don't care much what URL we use: the brand name and achieving concensus to get this off the ground is more important. Of course, a change in URL now means we have to go back through the site and change all the references again. . .

2) UBS (in the form of Matt Meinel, who feels Mike Hutchins will be in agreement with him) do not want us to redirect traffic from www.enrononline.com to the new site, as they feel that promotes too much of an association with Enron. I disagree with their position, but don't think this is too big a deal - we will just need to more heavily promote the new website name. Also, the execution version of the contract apparantly dropped the redirect requirement.

Please let me know if you have any issues with the above and how you want to proceed. We are ready to put the Splash page out and start marketing as of noon tomorrow, but these 11th hour changes are making me feel skittish about pulling the trigger and I feel a real lack of comfort about our ability to market a system with no name.

Dave
