Louise,

As you know, we were told during today's Integration Committee call that Marketing's and Legal's text changes for the
website would be accepted any time today. Following the call, however, I was told that the noon deadline was firm, but
we could make minor text changes on Thursday. Based on that information, we forwarded partial comments to Kal Shah by
noon. In a late afternoon email, I found out that we will not be able to complete our changes until perhaps five days
after the site goes live.

We appreciate the pressure and long hours people in Houston are putting into getting the site up and running. We applaud
their efforts and do not wish to add to their burden. I tell you this only to make you aware of our situation, should
any problems arise because of the unedited text. Hopefully, if anything does arise, problems can be easily and quickly
corrected.

Please call me at 212-713-8508 if you have any questions or if I can help you in any way.

Thank you,

Claudia Robinson
Director, Employee Communications, UBS Americas Inc.

Fine by me.  The site will go live this week-end in preparation for Monday
morning.

   Kal,

   Below are preliminary comments from Communications and Marketing on the
   Web content. We will be making more minor
   changes on Thursday, during the final review process, and review the
   site once it goes live next week.

   I sent comments from Legal to you earlier today.

   Please let me know if you have questions.

   Claudia
