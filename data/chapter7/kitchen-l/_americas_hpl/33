AEP and the HPL transaction

There is a remote possibility that AEP may be slow in fitting out their offices  in time for the acquisition of HPL to reach closure sooner rather than later (essentially all of the wiring in between offices).  If so Brian is putting together a back up plan where they could be sited in our building.  This would mean that a link has to be made between their office and here - that's where you guys come in.  Brian will give you a ring to discuss using the direct connection EOL is putting in place as an intermediate step.

It might work?

Thanks

Louise
