Louise, - Hello=20

I have attached the draft of the indemnity Anne sent to AEP last week.  Thi=
s is still under discussion as  AEP  has not yet commented on this draft.  =
We expect to get their initial comments tomorrow after AEP arrives and meet=
s with their counsel.

The A/S line resolution is now the critical path item and the note below is=
 a discussion of the current status of the A/S Line and where we want to en=
d up with AEP   =20

Anne:

Thanks for the prompt response.

I have some concerns about the Performance Guaranty.  The guaranty document=
 covers three specific contracts (referred to as "Transaction Agreements"),=
 but those contracts are not identified in the performance guaranty by cont=
ract number.  I have reviewed Schedule 4.13 and think I have identified the=
 three contracts as #96019120, #9604582 and #96002879, and I note that all =
of these contracts are also listed as "Newco Contracts on Schedule 4.13.  H=
owever, the parties to these three contracts as listed in Schedule 4.13 doe=
sn't match the designation of the parties in the performance guaranty.  Obv=
iously the three contracts have "changed hands" on both sides, i.e., seller=
 and buyer.   Since the performance agreement is an existing obligation of =
HPL, there must be a set of records that clearly traces and memorializes th=
e changes in the guaranteed obligations, and we must see that set of record=
s before AEP can finally determine how to address the performance agreement=
.  Obviously AEP doesn't want to create any unnecessary problems with Entex=
 as the beneficiary of the guaranty, but I want to be sure that this arrang=
ement doesn't need some attention in connection with the closing.  If you c=
an make the relevant records available I'll very promptly review them and w=
e can then decide if anything needs to be done before the closing.

Thanks for your help.

Mike
