Thanks for the update. 

Barbara/Anne:
Once we get DoJ's 2nd request, lets meet with AEP (Mon) to integrate Lara into our meeting with DoJ on Tuesday.

Steve,

Thanks for forwarding.  Actually, Brian sent it to me on Monday, and I followed up with Ann and Barbara.  I have not spoken with Brian yet because I am waiting for a green/red light from Barbara as far as Jade Eaton is concerned.  Barbara and I spoke at length yesterday and she is concerned about the counterparty's reaction to a meeting with DOJ (even an informal one).  She plans to get back to me though with regard to whether they want me to get involved at this stage.  I spoke to Rick as well so he is up-to-date with the current status.  

I'll let you know if anything further develops.  Thanks again.

Lara
