Anne and I talked  with Neil Imus (our V&E HSR lawyer) after our meeting this afternoon.  We relayed to him the substance of our discussions.  He reiterated his earlier position that there is "no harm" is requesting a shorter extension in a non-offensive fashion.   He had talked with one of AEP's lawyers earlier and AEP is considering requesting a meeting with Jade to discuss our need for a June 1 closing. We also believe that this would a good approach; however, the three of us concurred that timing is more important than the method of communication and that if a meeting cannot be arranged in the next day or two, we should go ahead and present our request over the phone, with a letter to follow perhaps.  We attempted to reconnect with AEP's lawyers but were unsuccessful.  We will continue to try to press AEP for a decision on how to proceed.  

Please call me or Anne if you have any questions.  We will keep you posted.
