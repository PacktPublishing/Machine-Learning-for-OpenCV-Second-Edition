Thanks for the note.  I opposed the numbers issue, as well.  AEP is adamant about them being in there and Whalley, Redmond, and Colwell were fine with it.

First of all, congratulations.  I was afraid you were going to have your baby in the office.  My wife and I are getting some sleep, but as I'm sure you're experiencing, it comes in short doses.  I hope all is well for you.  Thanks for the flowers.  They were incredible!

Eric

Eric,

Fine with this (although I do not like having the actual numbers in them as you know).

Hope you are getting some sleep - I know I'm not.


Louise

Attached is a draft press release regarding the completion of AEP's purchase of HPL.  This transaction is expected to close today (Friday, June 1) and the release would follow the completion of the deal.  Please review and return any comments to me at your earliest convenience.

Eric
