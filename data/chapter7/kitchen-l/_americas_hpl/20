FYI - 

Sally - Bob and/or I will keep you posted on how we get on.  It may be a better outcome if we can sell our imbalances to AEP as we will have a hard time resolving them after the Close.

Team,
During out meeting on Thursday, we decided that we would meet once a week in Brian Redmond's conference room.  Everyone with outstanding  receivables is invited (that is a nice way of saying Mandatory).  Brian would like for us to 
meet every week until the receivables balance is at zero.

Thanks

Next meeting time is:
	Wednesday the 18th
	4:00
	Conference room 3567

Ed, below are the outstanding transportation receivables.
	Mitchell Gas Services, LP		96,960
	Dynegy Marketing 7 Trade		118,892
	Exxon Company USA			73,892
	Entex Gas Marketing			58,127
	PG&E Texas Industrial Energy. LP	200,456
