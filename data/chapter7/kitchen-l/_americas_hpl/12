Louise:

Not sure if you want me to send you updates or not?  I sent you a copy of the latest HPL status report and I have been keeping John L. up to speed.  The critical path is the Texas AG's request that AEP execute a protocol describing how they will comply with existing regulations governing intrastate pipelines in Texas.   AEP is currently in discussion with the Texas AG and we will meet with AEP on Wed/Thursday.  Our gain/loss on sale picture for HPL is the same as when you left (e.g. we will meet plan).

I have also attached a summary of the key Tech Services deals.

Hope things are going well at home.

Brian
