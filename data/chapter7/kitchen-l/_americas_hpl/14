Congrats!  Parenthood makes you realize what a luxury sleep is.  

As mentioned in your last email I confirmed with Brian that he is ok with sending out the EPC Negotiation Team memo.  This group has already been meeting for several weeks and is helping in integrate TurboPark and RAC requirements into our development process.

Regards,
Brian
