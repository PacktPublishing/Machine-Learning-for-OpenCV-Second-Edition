AEP agrees with the idea that once we Close they would begin paying us "rent" for the space and furniture, but this would not recover all our costs.  I estimate a cost of $200k, but it is worth it to close early and save $6MM per month in labor, overhead and capital costs.

Do we get any recompense for this expenditure from AEP?

Russell,
Thanks for the update.  Can you provide a rough quote/schedule to kit out the Louisiana space for 130 people - please contact Lillian Carroll to get an exact count.   We don't need recorded phones.  Also please lay out a schematic of the  hardware configuration between Enron, Louisiana and AEP's offices for this solution.

Deborah,
Can you provide Lillian with a floor plan so that she can start locating the HPL staff by function.  Also, what do you recommend regarding furniture?  We should be able to come up with an interim solution based on the space coming available in 3 Allen or any additional furniture we have in warehouses or in the Louisiana bldg.  Your thoughts on cost for this?

Once we have a plan/schedule I will follow up with AEP to let them know of our plans.  They already know we are headed in this direction, given their delay in leasing space.

Regards,
Brian

Subject:	Possible Temporary Move of HPL to 1201 Louisiana

I finished the walk through of the 15th floor space located at 1201 Louisiana this afternoon.  On the walk through with me were Paul Foust (facilities), Robert Humlicek, Jeffrey Vincent and Andrew Hawthorn.  I previously talked with Deborah Bubenko and Vincent Fox about this space.  Comments from the review are as follows:

Most of the floor is composed of offices with some large group areas (conference rooms etc.) included.  The floor can accommodate up to 150 people.  However, with this amount of people in the area, space will be VERY tight. Almost all offices will need to hold at least two people.  Large offices will need to hold three or four.  The larger areas will need to have cubicles installed to make complete use of the space.  With maximum doubling up in the offices, you might fit a couple of conference rooms on the floor with one kitchen area.  There are nooks just off some of the hallways that would accommodate several network printers.

As Tommy stated in his earlier e-mail on the Allen center space, the fire code will require us to put a strobe in each office with multiple occupants. 

One area of concern is the amount of furniture currently on the floor.  The floor plan shows approximately 90 desks on the floor.  Some offices were locked so we could not verify the total.  However,  this number appears correct.  Also, for the most part, there were only desks in the offices unless they were occupied.  Chairs, filing cabinets, credenzas, etc. would needed to be added to this space.  We need to determine where the additional furniture will come from. 

There is one large area with 11 cubicles forming a circle.  According to Paul, this was the area where telephones were answered for the previous tenant.  This might work for the trading area.  The room appears to have the most telephone connectivity, is open, and would accommodate up to 11.

If we decide trader telephones are necessary (record conversations etc.), the cost associated with the purchase of the equipment and the necessary installation time will need to be factored into our schedule.  

The floor has two data closets.  At least one of the closets has 24 hour air conditioning according to Vincent.  

This floor has the same server connectivity at the Three Allen Center space.  A 100 meg single mode fiber connection serves this space. 

Robert has informed me that the floor currently has switches to support up to 200 ports.  However, this does not mean that the drops to all offices are complete.  Probably some cabling will need to be added.  It appears that the space can accommodate up to 150 users even with the extra ports needed for network printers, laptops, etc.  However, if we need to accommodate more than 200 ports, additional switches can be added. 

In summary, the floor space at 1201 Louisiana looks as good or better than the space that was being considered at Three Allen Center.
