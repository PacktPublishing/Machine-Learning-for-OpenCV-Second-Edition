Louise,
 
Per our conversation yesterday, I am hoping that the email from Bob Superty is sufficient correspondence to enable John to hire Cindy Franklin into the Wellhead desk.  Please confirm this is correct by sending me or Jeanie Slone an email with your approval.  
 
By the way, Applied Terravision is up again today ( +.10) and has traded as high as 1.50.  The last trade was at 1.40.  In addition, I spoke with Wes about having eight seats on the floor for the Wellhead/Ecommerce effort under John Grass.  I will have to meet with Arnold today, because to individuals will have to move in order for me to have access to two vacant seats.
 
The need for eight seats is broken out as follows :
 
Kathy Kelly - Wellhead
Cindy Franklin - Wellhead
Dayem Khandker - Wellhead / Ecommerce
Judy Thorne -Wellhead
John Grass- Wellhead / Ecommerce
 
Jean Mrha
Vacant -  Expected Ecommerce originator need after expected closing of outsourcing deals 
Vacant -  Ecommerce Associate / Analyst
 
I am conflicted about having a seat on six and on five, but I think it is necessary from a Management/business perspective.  Do you concur?
 
Regards, Mrha

Louise, attached is a short note from Cindy Franklin's manager in Logisitics, Victor Lamadrid, and a more detailed progress report which was also written by him. I completely agree with Victor's assessment and have no doubt that Cindy will continue to improve and become an even more valuable and productive employee. I believe she is well suited for the new position in the Upstream Services group. 
 
Please let me know if you have any additonal concerns, questions - Bob Superty

Kathy, Per your request, below is the letter updating you on Cyndi's progress.  I think, she will be a very good addition to your team.  Her experience and familiarity with our systems/procedures as well as her  industry contacts should make your operations more effective and efficient.  If you have any questions, please let me know. Please forward this to all necessary personnel.  Once this move is approved, let's get together soon afterward and discuss a transition plan.

THANKS

Victor
