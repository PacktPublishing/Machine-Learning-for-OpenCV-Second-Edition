Please find attached the following items :
?	Memorandum outlining immediate tasks to prepare for the sale of ENA's forty percent interest in the Bridgeline Holdings Limited Partnership with Chevron/Texaco.
?	Worksheet demarcating the composition of all investments associated with Bridgeline. Currently, capital investments associated with Enron No. 1 have not been included with the rest of Bridgeline investments.  ENA is contributing this strorage facility to satisfy our capital contribution as outlined in Schedule 3, Volume I (Project Hurricane).
?	Draft outline of initial strategy for "Project Sugarcane."  This outline authored by Brian Redmond identifies the following :

i.  Deal strategy
ii. Potential structure and counter-parties
ii. Pre-Sale conditions

In addition, Brian and I met with Don Miller this past week and gave him an overview of the partnership, its inherent assets and deal history.
