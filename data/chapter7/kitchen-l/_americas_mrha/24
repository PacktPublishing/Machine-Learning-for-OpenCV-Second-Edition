Per Louise's request, listed below are the personnel who support the wellhead desk:

Logistics

George Smith
Jesse Villareal 
Lisa Trofholz
Margie Straight
Terry Franklin (part-time)


Volume Management

Nina Nguyen

Risk

Kulvinder Fowler

Settlements

Mary Ellenberger
Michael Mousteiko

Settlements and Logistics also have three additional people that support the Appalachian pool deals
that came with the CES contracts and the Denver deals.  These individuals were in the 2001 budget
but would also be charged to the wellhead desk, if the deals move into the wellhead book. 

Let me know if you need any further information.

thanks
