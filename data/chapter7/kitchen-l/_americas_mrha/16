I spoke with Tad Herz today.  Tad stated that Cordillera is waiting on one other proposal.  However, Tad informed me that Enron's bid was currently in first place.  Cordillera should make a decision within a week.  Any suggestions or ideas to possibly influence Cordillera decision.


Thanks  ... Kevin
