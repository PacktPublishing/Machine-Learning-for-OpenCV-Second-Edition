Scott,
It is my understanding that you will be taking the Mariner/Burlington Pluto transaction into your portfolio in the 3Q01.  I am available next week to train the appropriate person in your group on the deal background, current status, deal valuation, accounting, etc.  

Please advise.

Thanks, 
Lisa A. Druzbik
