Melissa,

As delineated below, I spoke to Louise and you will be her contact.  I plan on delivering weekly updates to Louise every Tuesday from each of the business units.
Thank you.

Regards, 

Jean

Can you get someone in your group to take responsibility for getting me the deal status report you gave me earlier this week to me on a weekly basis with updates on each deal.

(I am trying to get my life sorted out - prior to disappearing)..

I will be picking up emails after the initial pain is over.
