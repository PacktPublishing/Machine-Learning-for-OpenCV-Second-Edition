Louise,

I spoke with John and at most, he believes that 6.5 employees should be currently staffed under logistics, scheduling and risk management.  In addition, overall, the Wellhead desk should create a net cost savings across the scheduling and logistics natural gas organization for the following reasons:

1. The number of schedulers needed on the regional firm desks should be less - 
	a. Scheduling between pooling points is relatively easy
	b. The Wellhead support is responsible for all the scheduling and logistics duties between Wellhead and pooling point - which comprise most of the deliverability risk
2. The Wellhead desk has currently, at most, four schedulers for the whole country - 
	a. How many schedulers are associated with the firm desks?  

In addition, if the Wellhead desk is being straddled with these fixed costs, then all outsourcing deals brought in should be pure margin, no?

I am having Judy Thorne and Kevin Miller dig into the details to verify these points.
