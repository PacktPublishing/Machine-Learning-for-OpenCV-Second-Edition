Jean,  We have appointed three new directors for LRCI, Inc.  They are yourself, Mark Haedicke, and Brian Redmond.  The records show the current directors as Mark Haedicke and Louise Kitchen, but we were unable to find any resolutions supporting this.  We will clean the records up to reflect the new directors.  Since you and Brian are on the management of Bridgeline, it is a more logical fit for you to be directors.  The resolutions for the Napoleonville Land Sale with the new directors are being circulated for signature.  You may have already seen it.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.
