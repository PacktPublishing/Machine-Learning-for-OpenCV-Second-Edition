Louise,

I think that Shelley Corman would be best suited to run the sub-committee during your maternity leave.  I think that I am perceived as too commercial focused (with emphasis on the Associate/Analyst program) and in addition, her representation of ET & S would balance the leadership of the other sub-committees.  

Besides, I think you know I will be active participant regardless of my assigned role.

Regards, Jean
