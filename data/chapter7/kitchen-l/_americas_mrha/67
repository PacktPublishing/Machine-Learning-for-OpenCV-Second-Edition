Congratulations on closing the deal with Formosa, TEPPCO, et al.  It sounds like it was a very complex negotiation with a number of different players.  

Clean Fuels is certainly pleased with the new long term storage arrangement with Formosa.  We will begin working with them to better define the operating parameters (timing, pressures, volumes, etc) so we can develop the specific facility plans and cost estimates as necessary. 

You had also mentioned that you might be willing to share the management presentation that was put together for this deal?  That would be very interesting reading and I would appreciate a copy if possible. 

Thanks again,  John Goodpasture
