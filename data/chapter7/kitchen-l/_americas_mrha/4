Here's the deal:
=20
There is some P&L that needs to be taken whether we sell or not: (1) a depr=
eciation catchup (impairment) that has not been taken of approx $647,000 (r=
emember approx $4 million was taken in the 3rd qtr, but upon calculation, n=
ot enough) and (2) a depreciation catchup for the 4th qtr (thru November, a=
ssuming a quick sale) based on a units-of production depreciation method (t=
o avoid impairment problems going forward) of approx $2.2 million.  These t=
ogether are approx $2.8 million of loss, but again, I have suggested that t=
hese need to be taken whether we sell or not.  The sell/hold decision re: t=
he Duke deal is a loss of $1.95 million (adjusted NBV after impairments/dep=
r catchup of $16 million, less the $14.1 of sales proceeds) in exchange for=
 the $14.1 million in cash.  So, sale is proposed at below book.  Jean/Lisa=
 would think of the Duke deal as Mariner/Burlington cash flows being discou=
nted at 12%, plus a premium of $1.3 million. Evidently they have found some=
 reserves upside, thus the premium above the base cash flow annuity. Any qu=
estions, pls call me - x 37665.

Louise,
=20
Please see the attached correspondence below between ENA, Duke and Mariner.=
  Via facsmille, ENA has received a non-binding offer of $14.1 MM with a pr=
oposed effective date as of December 1, 2001, but the transaction would mos=
t likely close mid-December.  A meeting has been set up between ENA and Mar=
iner to discuss data needed to address remaining due dilgence items on 11/2=
7/01.  A follow-up meeting with Duke is scheduled for 11/28/01.
=20
If you have any further questions, please contact me at my father's house (=
1-716-667-0107) or Ms. Lisa Druzbik (713-853-9620).  Lisa has been working =
with Kevin Miller to divest of the MEGS flowline and will be working tomorr=
ow.

Thanks for the message.  Duke's non-binding offer made today is $14.1MM in =
cash with a proposed effective date of December 1, 2001 and includes an acc=
eptable premium over the minimum cash flow stream (Duke faxed the offer let=
ter, therefore, I cannot forward it electronically). =20

Duke e-mailed their outstanding due diligence items (see attached e-mail); =
we need Mariner's assistance to answer many of the questions listed and to =
provide appropriate documentation.  As mentioned earlier, Kevin Miller and =
I would like to meet with you and others at Mariner to discuss the due dili=
gence list and action plan; we plan to come to your offices on Monday, Nove=
mber 26th at 1:30.=20

Let me know if you have any questions or comments.=20

Thanks,=20
