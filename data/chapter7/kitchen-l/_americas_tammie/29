Did you ever receive a refund check from ADT Security?

Expenses:
They have informed me your $5,000 payment was issued on 1/4/01 and it takes 10 business days to arrive.  It was mailed here so I will keep an eye out for it.  They also said all of you expense reports have been processed but they can not pay the remaining balances until they get approval from Enron.  I will keep on top of it.  Have you heard anything else about us getting paid our remaining balances?
