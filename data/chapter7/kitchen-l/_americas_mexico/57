I just received the information to prepare DESC's proposal. I am sending a copy to Steve to Houston,
and the original to Marc to Monterrey, first thing tomorrow morning.
As you will see, the information is very detailed, and was prepared by Protego ( Aspe & Souza) for
DESC (they paid for the study), and Luis Tellez has asked us to keep it confidential.

Dr. Tellez main concerns, which should be reflected in our proposal, are:
	1) 10 & 15 years schemes.
	2) He wants to enjoy the benefits of price changes in the Texas Market.
	3) He does not want to be attached to a single technology (i.e. inside the fence power plant)
	    but rather enjoy the benefits (and risks) of being part of a Market.
