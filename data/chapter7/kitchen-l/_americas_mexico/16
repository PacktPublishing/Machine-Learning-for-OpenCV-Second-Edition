Louise, I know last thursday and friday we had difficulty buying options from customers. 
Since Friday, I have a customer (Tamsa), that wants to sell back to ENA, some South Texas Index options, for an amount close to $4.8 Million in premiums.
When do you think we can get back to normal trading ? Please advice so we can act accordingly. Best regards.
