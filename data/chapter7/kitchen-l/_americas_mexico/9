Can you talk with Jaime and figure out a plan of support for Mexico (if we still need one)? You might also want to check with John and/or Louise.

Rick

Thanks for your encouraging words during the last few days. I have to say that despite all the difficulties we have had to endure over the past few months, Enron remains the best place I have ever worked.This is due, in no small part, to the great people I share this place with. 

I also owe you an overdue e-mail on the Mexico matter. As I had indicated, I have decided not to take the offer. I have spoken to a number of friends and associates who live in Monterrey and their views are pretty unanimous: Monterrey is a great place to live if one is already settled with a family, but it is altogther different and more difficult for a  single man. Therefore, despite the professional opportunity to work with a great team, I have decided not accept the offer. 

Many thanks for keeping me  in mind, being patient, and moving things along. I will be in touch in the next couple of days. Enjoy your holiday. 

Best regards, 
Paul
