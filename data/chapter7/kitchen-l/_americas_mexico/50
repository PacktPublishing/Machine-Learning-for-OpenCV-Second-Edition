Louise,

Attached is an excel file that contains the following:

1. Summary - a table of what we believe DeAcero could expect to save at different gas prices.
2. A list of advantages and risks of entering into the import deal.

If you have any questions please do not hesitate to give me a call.

Thanks,
Marc.

I would like to see the information you set out to David on why he should sign the PPA.  This is purely for me to gain a better understanding of the thought process in Mexico.  Please could you email it to me.
Thanks
Louise
