There is a note for you to be in Monterrey on Wednesday but I can't see any definite travel plans.  Shall we cancel?

Conference for next week: I guess it doesn't make sense for you to travel, after all that happened this week.
Numbers are great, we have 140 people confirmed already.  I'll do the welcome Speech, and Steve's part as well.
I'll try to get some pictures, and send them out to you.
Best regards.
