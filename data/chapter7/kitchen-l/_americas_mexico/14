Thanks to you, Louise...I Would love to hear from you some general criteria for the type of transactions that we don't feel comfortable doing now, and what needs to happen to get back to 100% business as usual.
Best regards.

If we make 1 ct. of orig, we would do $44,000. The $4.796 MM is the quote from the Trader. The position would then be closed.

If you unwind - what's the mtm for you and closing the position?
