Louise,

I heard your speech at the all employee meeting and was interested in more information regarding you efforts to recruit people for the Mexican market.  I joined the Continental Power Trading Group in '98 and before that in Houston for a year and a half on the power night shift and on the risk management side.  I would like to find out more about what you are planning in Mexico and see if I my background can add any value.  I lived in Mexico many years and have a deep understanding of the culture and language.  I have a keen interest in Latin America and would enjoy exploring opportunities in the Mexican market. 

Best of luck,

Adrian Mancebo
