Title: Mexican Power Sector: On the Road to Reform--Can't Get There From Here?

REFORM DELAYS MAY STRAIN THE GRID AND INVESTOR CONFIDENCE
Substantial and definitive electricity sector reform is needed to ensure that
Mexico?s economic engine continues to run smoothly.  The stalled power reform
process is putting investor confidence in Mexico at risk, however, affecting
planning strategies and new projects as investors await a clearer understanding
of the energy playing field.  Key factors include

* waning interest in Mexico?s independent power producer program

* continued strong demand growth expected

* lack of details on the proposed reforms, which have not been made public
