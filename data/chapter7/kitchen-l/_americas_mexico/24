We are at 196.5 Bcfs, and Origination of $4.3 MIllion.  We don't have "mini-books" to calculate our mark to market, but we'll have it ready this morning for you. 
By the way, we closed a Financial Zinc Deal, with Galvak (Alfa Group), in which we made around $75k. The customer bought a fixed price and a tunnel, for a total of 45,600 tons. We negotiated it with Enron Metals (London Group), and it was back - to - backed with ENA. 

Best regards.
