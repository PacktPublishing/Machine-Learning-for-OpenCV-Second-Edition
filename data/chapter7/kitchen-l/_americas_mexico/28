Louise, 

Great news that you are coming to the Monterrey Conference!  
FYI, conferences in both cities are pretty full already.  We have almost 100 people confirmed for the Monterrey event, and 85 for MExico City. 
The audience is basically Finance Directors, Treasurers and Purchasing Managers of the top industries in Mexico.  We covered pretty much the whole country, so in Monterrey there are people coming from all the northern states, such as Tamaulipas, Nuevo Leon, Coahuila, Chihuahua, Sonora, Durango, Zacatecas, Etc. 

The agenda is attached, and I'll Jump-start the conference, talk about the agenda, introduce the members of the Enron de Mexico Team that will be present, including you and then,  Suggestion: I think we should dedicate a minute of silence, in respect to the victims of last week's events.  After that, I will introduce you, and then pass you the microphone. There will be simultaneous translation so you can feel free to talk in English.

Steve sent you a breifing on the Vitro Plant, in case the topic comes up:  

The following is a brief bullet point description of the Monterrey Cogeneration Plant to incorporate intom the information you are send Louise in preparation for the conference tomorrow.

*  245 MW Cogeneration Facility located in Garcia, Nuevo Leon (about 20 miles west of Monterrey).
* Natural Gas fired GE 7FA gas turbine is the anchor piece of equipment used at the facility.
* Commercial Operations set for October 31, 2002.
* Power Purchasers are Vitro (110 MW), Imsa (90 MW), and Apasco (40 MW) under 15 year PPAs.
* Vitro subsidiary Alcali to be supplied 210 tons per hour of steam under a 15 year SPA.
* Transmission and Distribution of the electricity to be provided by the CFE.
* Natural Gas to be provided by PGPB (Pemex).
* Financing provided by the Inter-American Development Bank.
* Major Equipment Foundations have been completed at the Construction Site, and equipment is beginning to be placed on the foundations.
* The offtakers of energy from this plant are expected to save over US$ 400 MM over the term of the 15 year agreements

A couple of other things to note are to the extent the project comes up, all Enron people should refer to the project as the Monterrey Cogeneration Plant and not the Vitro plant so as not to diminish Imsa and Apasco, and to the extent we are questioned on the sell-down of the equity the response there is that initiative, while not finalized, is being pursued to manage Enron's balance sheet and that Enron will continue to maintain a significant equity interest in the facility.
