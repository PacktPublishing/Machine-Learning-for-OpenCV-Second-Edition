Louise, 

Great news that you are coming to the Monterrey Conference!  
FYI, conferences in both cities are pretty full already.  We have almost 100 people confirmed for the Monterrey event, and 85 for MExico City. 
The audience is basically Finance Directors, Treasurers and Purchasing Managers of the top industries in Mexico.  We covered pretty much the whole country, so in Monterrey there are people coming from all the northern states, such as Tamaulipas, Nuevo Leon, Coahuila, Chihuahua, Sonora, Durango, Zacatecas, Etc. 

The agenda is attached, and I'll Jump-start the conference, talk about the agenda, introduce the members of the Enron de Mexico Team that will be present, including you and then,  Suggestion: I think we should dedicate a minute of silence, in respect to the victims of last week's events.  After that, I will introduce you, and then pass you the microphone. There will be simultaneous translation so you can feel free to talk in English. 

 


Suggested talking points: 

- Review Enron's Primary Achievements in Mexico: 
	- Providing Risk Management Products for the Mexican Industry 
		- Leveraging Enron's Major Strengths and Capabilities
		- Leading provider of Natural Gas and Fuel Oil Derivatives
		- Serving the Top-200 energy-intensive private companies in Mexico
		- Providing specific products for the Mexican market
		- Helping businesses to increase thier optionality in a regulated environment
				
	- Monterrey Cogeneration Plant
		-  245 MW Cogeneration Facility located in Garcia, Nuevo Leon (about 20 miles west of Monterrey).
		- Natural Gas fired GE 7FA gas turbine is the anchor piece of equipment used at the facility.
		- Commercial Operations set for October 31, 2002.

- Expand our Business in the Future:
		- Derived from the Integration of Mexico - US Energy Markets
		- Provide Transparency and Optionality to markets (Power and Gas) 
			U.S. - Sourced Power
			Cogeneration or Combined Cycle facilities
		
I will coordinate with Tammy for picking you up at the Monterrey Airport. Let me know if you want to have lunch or if you plan to eat during your flight. 

Best Regards, 
Jaime Williams

			
Steve sent you a breifing on the Vitro Plant, in case the topic it comes up:  

The following is a brief bullet point description of the Monterrey Cogeneration Plant to incorporate intom the information you are send Louise in preparation for the conference tomorrow.

*  245 MW Cogeneration Facility located in Garcia, Nuevo Leon (about 20 miles west of Monterrey).
* Natural Gas fired GE 7FA gas turbine is the anchor piece of equipment used at the facility.
* Commercial Operations set for October 31, 2002.
* Power Purchasers are Vitro (110 MW), Imsa (90 MW), and Apasco (40 MW) under 15 year PPAs.
* Vitro subsidiary Alcali to be supplied 210 tons per hour of steam under a 15 year SPA.
* Transmission and Distribution of the electricity to be provided by the CFE.
* Natural Gas to be provided by PGPB (Pemex).
* Financing provided by the Inter-American Development Bank.
* Major Equipment Foundations have been completed at the Construction Site, and equipment is beginning to be placed on the foundations.
* The offtakers of energy from this plant are expected to save over US$ 400 MM over the term of the 15 year agreements

A couple of other things to note are to the extent the project comes up, all Enron people should refer to the project as the Monterrey Cogeneration Plant and not the Vitro plant so as not to diminish Imsa and Apasco, and to the extent we are questioned on the sell-down of the equity the response there is that initiative, while not finalized, is being pursued to manage Enron's balance sheet and that Enron will continue to maintain a significant equity interest in the facility.
