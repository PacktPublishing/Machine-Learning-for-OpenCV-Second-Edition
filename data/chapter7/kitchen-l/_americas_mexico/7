Brian,

It looks like we should be able to cover Vitro with the people in Virgo's group.  Robert Rimbau is currently very involved, and can stay involved and we can bring Dave Kristich if needed.  

As we discussed, pursuant to the terms of the Transition Services Agreement, we need to contact Tractebel as soon as anyone listed on the schedule is unavailable.  Do you have the contact info for Tractebel?

Thanks,

Don
