Schedule 7.1 list the "Sundance B Power Purchase Agreement" as an asset that Enron can sell.  However, to quote the document, "provided that the party proposing to take such action has provided the other party with advance notice of the proposed action to the extent practicable". The net result is that they can't stop you since it is listed, but we do need to notify them.  Sorry for any confusion.
