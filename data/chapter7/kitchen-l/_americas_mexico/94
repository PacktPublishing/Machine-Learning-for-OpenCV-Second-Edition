That is good news.  In Mexico and probably elsewhere in Latin America, we can use this unit for information gathering purposes in return for a quantifiable risk since O&M agreements are typically capped in terms of overall exposure.  It may be tough to break into third-party projects (assuming we would want to strategically), but at least on projects that we initiate, we can keep a handhold even after we sell down our equity stake.

Best regards - Max

Good news - it will report into Brian eventually - obviously this is still confidential.

Louise - 

OEC will come along with EECC & NEPCO.  Brian Stanley and Keith Dodson will run that group.

Speak with you soon.  Hope you are feeling well.

Regards - Dan

What happens to the OEC group - does that currently report to you and will it going forward or does that move too?
