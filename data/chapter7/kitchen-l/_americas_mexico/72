I am back in the office this morning after a week's vacation. I will get the facts and get back with you.  Confirmations have been prepared in Houston all along for the Monterrey office.  After the Doorstep review, we designated a specific point person here in Houston to be the primary liasion with the Monterrey office.  That individual is bilingual, a key factor in choosing him for the role.  I will get back with you later today.  

Who should be our primary contact in Monterrey now that Max has joined the PUC?  --Sally

Can you do me a favour and check into the back office work done in Houston for Mexico, it appears that there are some delays on execution of agreements which I believe the confirms group is supposed to do.  They only have 53 deals this year so its not many.  Is Houston the best place to do this bearing in mind language and cultural issues.  I realize it was moved from Mexico following a doorstop but the Monterrey office is very concerned about the back log.

Thanks

Louise
