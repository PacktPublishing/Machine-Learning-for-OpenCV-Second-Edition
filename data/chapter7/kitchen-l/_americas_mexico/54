Jaime Williams telephoned today to follow up on a variety of issues. He inquired about the results of the PRC for his employees which I can provide given you concur and he would like to have a copy of the analysis that was done on the contractors we had working in Mexico that he originally was interested in considering employment.  He appears to have some questions on the analysis.  Are you comfortable with me providing a copy to him?
