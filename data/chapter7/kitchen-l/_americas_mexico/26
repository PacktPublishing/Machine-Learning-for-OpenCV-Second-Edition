Guys, I just want to thank all of you who participated in putting together the Risk Management Conference.  We had a great response from our customers, reaching 140 attendants to the 2 events. We have seen the Comment - Sheets and the customers are very pleased with the quality of the event. They loved the material, the place and the service.  As a consequence of that, we got a lot interest in our business, not only for gas derivatives, but also for supplying power, which we are already following up.

We event got resumes from people that wanted to join our team, which speaks very well about the image we convey. 

Over the last 3 years, this Conference has set a standard in the Mexican gas derivatives business; and my special thanks go to the Risk Management Team. I urge you to keep on showing this kind of excellence in performing your job.

Best regards.

Jaime Williams.
