	I met yesterday with Guillermo Vogel, CEO of Tamsa.( 110 MW).
He was interested in receiving a proposal from Enron, based on an import of power scheme.
He offered me to give us a quick response, on whether they are seriously interested.
He will be out of the country for two weeks, and told me he will be ready to review our deal then.
The steps are as follows:
			1) Mr Gustavo Rosas (from their Veracruz site) will provide all the information we require.
		                He called me today, and is preparing the information. (Mr Rosas phone no. 2989-1100 x 4006)
			2) Marc should call Mr Rosas next Monday 9, confirm all the information that I requested,
	                           and schedule a visit to Veracruz next week, since Mr Rosas wants to meet us there.
			3) Prepare a proposal with 10 and 15 years prices, that we should deliver in two weeks time. 
So far, it looks promising.
	Regards,	jaime____
