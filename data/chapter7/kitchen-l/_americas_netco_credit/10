Louise,

Attached is the initial list of counterparty names for the Launch Date.  If a name was on the original list you provided we have added all major counterparties in the Group.  As we will need to get Credit Limits approved on an expedited basis, please provide any adjustments to this list you deem necessary as soon as possible.

Thanks,
Bill
