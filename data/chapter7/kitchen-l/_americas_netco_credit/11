Here is a start on the list.  We have a meeting with UBS in the AM to review as well.  Obviously, I am putting limits that we would be willing to extend from a Credit Perspective only.  Taking into account liquidity and commercial drivers may adjust these numbers.  Let me know if you would like to discuss.

Regards,
Bill
