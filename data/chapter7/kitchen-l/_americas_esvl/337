Subject:	Proposed Employee Letter on Retention Program

Attached is a proposed letter to employees, which has been prepared in cooperation with Mary Joyce and Weil, Gotshal &  Manges.  We believe it is important to get this letter out Friday morning.  If you have any comments, please send them to me by 9:00 a.m. on Friday.  If you have an objection to sending the letter, please call Steve Kean, Mark Palmer or me (ext. 66423).
