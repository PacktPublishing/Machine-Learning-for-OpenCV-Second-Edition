Gus is in the environmental group.  Most of his time is spent on ENA  activities.  I think he is probably needed if you guys plan to have any asset activity or for orderly wind down.  Someone needs to pick him up.


Also, of the reg. people you picked up I don't think you picked up gas people who have supported you in the past.  Call me or have someone call me to identify your needs there.

Thanks.

Steve,

 these are the individuals in ENA  that Gus works for on projects.  Don Miller is the person that has asked Gus to talk to him in a few days after things settle down, and has indicated a strong interest to Gus  in having Gus continue to perform work on his projects.  Mike T
