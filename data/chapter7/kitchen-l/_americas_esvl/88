Tammy,

I have approx. 100+ people principally on 5, but some remain on 6.  I believe it will tough, if not impossible to move everyone by Tuesday (I have no idea where Jim Fallon is planning on putting his wholesale group).  I have forwarded this email to Jim, and anticipate that he will deal with it.

Thanks,

Don

Don, 
I am working on the space plan for NETCO.  I need a bit of assistance to identify the estate folks that are currently seated on either 5 or 6. Due to the short lead time I am on a rather tight leash.  Phase one of the project would require moving the estate people either to another ECS floor or perhaps to ECN.  We would potentially schedule these moves for Tuesday evening.  

Please advise as soon as possible the names and preferred location (ECS or ECN) for your estate team.

Thanks in advance for your help!
Tammy

Just when you thought it was safe............................

We need to start working on getting everyone together who is in Netco in time for the sale of the company.  The ideal move time would be either this week-end or the next.  The idea is that everyone (856) resides on 5 and 6 in the new building.  HR has the most up to date list of who all of the people are.  But essentially the organisation is just a smaller version of what we have today.

All commercial people on 6, non-commerical on 5.  We would need to plan for an office to be created in the room next to mine (but hold off on implementing that piece).

As the credit group is already here (in the room next to mine) - it would be really good to move them first so they do not have to move back to the old building and then back.

Thanks
