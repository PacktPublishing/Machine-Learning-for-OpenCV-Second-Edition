It is a touching message in the midst of all this bad stuff.  Matt is expressing what almost everyone who has been associated with EnronOnline feels, both those remaining and those who are no longer here: we were all a part of something special, and I think that compounds the loss we all feel.

This got to me tonight - If we come back, or when we come back we need to remember this guy.  I have no idea who he is but please can we hire him back if/when we get EnronOnline back on top.  We need to remember him next year.

A great reflection on you guys too.

I was part of the greatest team I have ever seen or heard of. We had unmatched talent and skill. We had a seemingly bottomless pool of experience to draw upon. We consistently diplayed unyielding determination and unwavering resolve. But, above all, an unbreakable commitment to help make Enron Online great. Throughout the decline we did what we had always done -- we did our best.

They took away my boss and my co-workers, whom I considered a family. I loved my job, and in the end they took that, too."  Matt Hommel,  former Enron employee * * * * * 	
We have all read the news and we all know the things that happened at Enron and we all know the names of those to blame. At the end of it all, the truth is that bad things happen. For myself I humbly asked for only one thing: The chance to rebuild Enron Online. I waited all day praying that I would get a call to tell me that my wish had been granted. Around 9 p.m. I got the call from the senior director that I hoped was good news. In the utmost professional manner, I was informed that there was no good news. 
Now it's over. I still get a bit choked up when I think about it. I don't work at Enron, and the team that I was a part of has been scattered in the streets. I made some good friends at Enron, but I know I won't see many of them again. Enron took those friendships, Enron took my 401(k), they took my stock options, they took away the day-old pastries that were always on the desk outside my office, they took the free sodas and the big screen TVs and the foosball table. They took away the free dinners we got on Friday nights during the new releases to the Web site. They took away the admin who always teased me because I ate like a pig and never gained weight. They took away the guy that beat me in foosball 5-1, despite the fact that he played with one hand and was carrying on a conversation on his cell phone while he played. They took away my boss and my co-workers, whom I considered a family. I loved my job, and in the end they took that, too. 
But let me say this. I have my memories. I am not going to ruin them with feelings of resentment or betrayal. I am going to keep my memories. They belong to me.
