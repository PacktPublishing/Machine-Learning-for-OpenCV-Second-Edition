What does margin based on average of MTM?  If we have agreed an average mark - what is their number?  Are these just the counterparties we margin/have a collateral threshold with?
Thanks

Louise

Louise,

We highlighted the counterparties that we are currently working to reconcile margin amounts.  Other counterparties are listed for whom we might have differences, however in normal business practice we have established a mutual agreement on how to manage their account.  We will be in early in the morning, call us if you have any questions.

Debbie and the "Onicas"
