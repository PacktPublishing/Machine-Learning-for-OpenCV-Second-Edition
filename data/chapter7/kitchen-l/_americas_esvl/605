Hi Louise,

We are having a typical trading pace so far today.  It is too early to tell if any counterparty is really cutting back.  Like yesterday, however, Aquila is buying longer dated physical gas and selling spot gas; so once again they are a big net buyer.

Trade counts, by 8:30 am, since October 1:
