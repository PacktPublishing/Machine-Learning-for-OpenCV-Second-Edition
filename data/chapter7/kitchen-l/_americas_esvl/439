Subject:	Total deal


We have a capesized vessel of 150,000 mt plus or minus ten percent of south African steamcoal that we asbolutely need to ship to keep the business going.  We are delivering the coal to Rotterdam against contracts with our long term German customers and  have a purchase price of 28.50 usd per metric tonne basis 6000 kcal/kg nar and an average sales price of net back equivalent of 2.50 usd per metric tonne profit margin. so the pnl on the deal would be 375,000 usd pnl positive. The vessel is loading approx 20 the December 2001.

Due to credit issues we have agreed the following subject our approval.

pre-pay 300,000 usd to Parent company TotalFina Elf- needs to be paid in the next 1-2 days.
then either pre-pay the full value of the cargo ca 4.272 million usd, or set-up standby letter of credit, both 3 days prior to loading. (i.e. 17th Dec)

This week Peter Abdo and I have met three banks and are working with them to give L/c capacity specifically based around our international coal flows. We have Absa
 bank looking at raising the l/c on this deal specifically and are confident that they will do so, such that the pre-pay on full value will not be required

Please can we get approval for the initial prepay of 300,000 usd in the next 1-2 days. We have in place a total fina elf parent company guarantee for good measure.

thanks in advance

Peter
