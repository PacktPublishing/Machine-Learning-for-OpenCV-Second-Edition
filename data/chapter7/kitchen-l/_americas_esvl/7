I spoke with berney this AM.  As you mentioned, I believe he needs some more $ (a risk premium in his words).  I told him that the intent is not to simply be a block-trading spec shop, but we do have a genuine interest in structured customer deals.  Also, the size of his group is irrelevant because the marketers will be asked to structure on their own and I will want Berney to have some oversight to ensure quality and consistency, as well as helping out on all of the big deals.
