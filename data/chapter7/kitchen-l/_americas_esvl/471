fyi... we can expect a number of calls Friday about our trading levels.  We need to be honest about counterparties and volumes without being alarmist.  I'll be in the office at 8:30 a.m. so will check with both of you in the morning. thx. kd

There will be a story in tomorrow's Financial Times about our trading position in Europe. Myself and John Sherriff spoke with London-based FT reporter Andy Taylor.

Andy is a long-standing contact and an Enron supporter. He spoke with various players in the European market and although they were supportive, they were also giving the impression that business with Enron had dropped 90%. 

This is not the case and it was therefore important to refute this. I'm comfortable with how the interview went. John made a point of saying how supportive counterparties had been and we did not discuss anything beyond our European trading position.

Will forward the coverage tomorrow.

Hope all is well and that you had an enjoyable Thanksgiving.

Cheers

Alex
