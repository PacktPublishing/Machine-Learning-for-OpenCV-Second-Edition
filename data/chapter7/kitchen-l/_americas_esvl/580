I just confirmed the cash funds were transferred this afternoon to ENA in the amount of $9 MM.  The total cash account for enovate was approximately $21 MM, with PEC 50% and ENA 50%.  Due to PEC request, we kept $3 MM in the account to cover cash sweeps required in the next few weeks.  

Just an FYI...
