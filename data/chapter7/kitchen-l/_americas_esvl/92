Hi Louise / Jay

If you can help shed any light on your vendor relationship with Legato
and Rational, and whether you believe there is scope for reviewing
these licenses with a view to changing the relevant license agreements,
that would be extremely helpful.  We understand that both these
products would be critical components to running the Netco systems.

Thx
Ursula

Thanks Bert.  As promised, I am following up with E Company on the
various
assigned agreements that prohibit providing service to a third party.
Feel
free to have Ursula pursue the question simultaneously.  I am also
looking
into what services the parties intend Fire to provide for transition as
this is not a part of the transaction that I have been following
closely to
date.

Roger

     The two licenses are:

     1.  Enterprise Software License Agreement between Legato
Systems, Inc. and [E] Corp, dated as of Sept. 27, 2001, respecting
numerous software products generally branded with the names
NetWorker, GEMS, Celestra, Octopus and others.  Section 2.2
provides:  "Restrictions on Use.  Licensee shall not, and shall
not aid, abet or permit any third party to: . . . (iii) . . . use
for timesharing or service bureau purposes or otherwise use . . .
the Software . . . for the benefit of third parties . . . ."

     2.  Products License Agreement #3185 Modified for [E]
Corp, issued by Ration Software Corp., dated as of Feb. 17, 1998,
respecting various software products branded Clearcase, Rational,
Purify, and Quantify and others.  Section 1.1 provides:  "General
Grant of License. . . . You may not rent, lease or use the Product
in a service bureau capacity. . . . ."

     We continue to review the agreements for the Service
Bureau issue as it is the most pressing from a time perspective.
We have already found several ambiguous licenses and will bring
those to your attention as a group later.

     If other express provisions such as the above turn up, I
will let you know on a case by case basis as this issue is one our
IT personnel are taking seriously.

     Bert
