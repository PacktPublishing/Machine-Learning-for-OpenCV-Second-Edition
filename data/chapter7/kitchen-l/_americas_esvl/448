Entergy has joined the SE Trans RTO (Southern, etal).  I will review the FERC filing; however, an Entergy rep called me today to ask for Enron's support stating that the new RTO proposal includes:
 
-- Independent Market Operator (he said such as PJM)
-- No Day Ahead Balanced Schedules
-- LMP
-- One OASIS and one Tariff (no separate tariff for Entergy's ITC)
-- One Security Coordinator
-- Initial license plate rate within Entergy area
-- local planning in Entergy footprint
 
He also said that they are trying to have the GridSouth group agree to use the same Independent Market Operator so there would be one market structure for the Southeast.
 
Hopefully, the filing reflects this -- more later.  Christi

Subject: SeTrans Update


Attached is an announcement on SeTrans adding Entergy as a member and setting dates for meeting in Atlanta in Jan. 2002 to form stakeholder group.  I haven't seen the update they provided to FERC.  I'll find it and get you a copy.
