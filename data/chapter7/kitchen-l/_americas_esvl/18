Hi Louise,

I don't have any corporate allocation number yet. I'll check into it and also work to redo the plan. Thanks!

We are clearly close to completing the new numbers - could you work with Jeanie and Amy to put a new plan together.

Do we have any corporate allocation number from UBS?

Thanks
