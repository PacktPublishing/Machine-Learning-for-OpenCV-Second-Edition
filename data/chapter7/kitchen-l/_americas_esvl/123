The information I provided to all of you is NOT exaggerated, thank you very=
 much.  You obviously don't have a clue as to what is happening with these =
employees, how far would $4,500 go for you if you lost your job today and a=
ll of your retirement and were a single mother?  That response to Louise ju=
st shows your obvious lack of compassion and to think you are the head of H=
R disturbs me.

Louise,

I think the information below is a little exaggerated, but there is truth i=
n our suppliers having difficulty dealing with all the requests they have b=
een inundated with. I will ask Robert and Cynthia to take a look and perhap=
s they can give summarise better than I what the actual position is.

Happy New Year all,

I have been with Enron for over 16 years and I have made some very good fri=
ends during my time here and right now I am feeling their pain and panic.  =
I talk to several of my terminated friends (and sister) each week and get u=
pdates from them on what is going on outside of Enron.  I just want to do w=
hatever I can to help them get through these hard times, this is the reason=
 for my weekly reminders to you all who have the power to do something for =
them.

I passed on the phone numbers for Towers Perrin and other numbers that they=
 need to get their money from the Cash Balance Plan or to find out more abo=
ut the COBRA benefits, etc. but there is a major stumbling block in their w=
ay right now.  They keep being told that no one can do anything for them, n=
ot even send them the necessary forms to get the ball rolling on these bene=
fits, because Enron has not changed their status from active to terminated =
(or inactive).  How can it possibly take a month to get this status changed=
?  Please realize that a lot of these people have nothing:  no paycheck com=
ing in, no unemployment checks YET, no retirement, no cash balance money, n=
o medical benefits....they are feeling scared and panicked....PLEASE lets d=
o something to help them.  I have no clue what all it takes to get 4,500+ e=
mployees status changed but surely it cannot take a month to accomplish thi=
s.  Whomever is in charge of getting this done, are we sure they have a sen=
se of urgency about the situation?  People could lose their homes, cars, et=
c. while they are waiting on all this red tape....this is very important.

Please advise.
