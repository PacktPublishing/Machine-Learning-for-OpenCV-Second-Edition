do you still want the multiple (so that it will be 47.5 instead of 39.6)

Kim mentioned that you're on the phone. Jenny designated the Disaster Recovery piece ($10M) and some other items as Capital Expenses, and we neglected to include this in our schedule. The total capital budget is $14.7M. I presume that you'll want to include this amount? 

What we currently have is expense plan of 24.9M with a 1.2 multiple equals 30.2m.

I think we'll want to amend it :

24.9M 	expense
14.7M	capital

39.6M	total (would you still want a multiple to increase to 47.5M?)

We have a call in for En Ops as well to make sure that there isn't any potential capital plan we might need to include.

Please let me know!
