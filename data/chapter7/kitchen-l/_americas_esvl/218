The New York 780 3rd Ave office is closed and has been inventoried. I am now working on the removal of the IT equipment. The 520 Madison office is leased under MG Metals and only a few ENA employees remain at that location. Chicago, Montreal and Toronto include some MG people and I am hoping to have some clarity on these locations early in the new year.

I appreciate your assistance

Paula Corey

What about Toronto and New York?

OK 

Please check with Don Miller too.  Netco does not want San Francisco going forward and probably not Chicago.

We have asked EPSC to pay the following leases for the month of January based on feedback from ENA commercial leadership.  My understanding is that we may still reject these leases under the bankruptcy if we do so by Feb 2.  I will revisit the status of these leases with you before February rents are to be paid.  

Calgary
Portland
San Francisco
Chicago
Denver

I have also been contacted by Paula Corey,  who is working on the enterprise strategy for the retrieval and disposition of remote office contents in the event any of these offices are closed.  I will keep you posted on the recommendations.

Regards,
Tammy
