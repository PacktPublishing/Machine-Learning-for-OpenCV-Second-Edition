Thank you for the presentations.  I forwarded your FERC question to Andy
Alter of our Legal Department, since he is handling the licensing issues for
this project.  He will get back to Jim Steffes.

On an unrelated note, what (if any) tech support obligations do you believe
Newco will have to the Bridgeline Holdings and AEP Energy Services joint
ventures?
