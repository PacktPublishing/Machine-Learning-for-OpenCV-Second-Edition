Paul,

As noted below, Tomorrow we will be receiving $19,046,751.96 related to the sale of COPEL.  

We should receive the amount on Friday, November 2, 2001 shortly after noon in the EPI cash inflow account (BOA account# 375-182603-5).  	

Theresa Brogan will be handling the wire to the EPI account. 

Incoming wires		Bank of America		375-182-6035		111-000-012	


This will be the remaining cash related to the sale of the COPEL shares.

Please call with any questions.  Thank you everyone for your help.

	Theresa,

	Do we know the amount of COPEL cash that we will be receiving tomorrow that we can expect to be forwarded to the EPI bank account.  

	I believe the amount should be $19,046,751.97. 

	Please verify as soon as possible so we can pass the information on to Treasury.  Please let us know what time we can expect the money also.


	Thank you,
