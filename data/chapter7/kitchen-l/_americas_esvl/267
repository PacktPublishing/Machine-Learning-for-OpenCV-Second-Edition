I was responding to Louise's request. I understood her request as one of id=
entifying what we used and then deciding whether it made sense to bring the=
m. If I can't have any of below systems we will be ok, but I will probably =
need one or two more people and a budget to buy a personnel database of som=
e nature.

It is my understanding that SAP is not being transferred and I don't think =
the other systems are going either.  Please find out from a commercial pers=
on what is contemplated on the HR side. =20

Anne,

Depending on who may bid, I would at least in the first instance expect we =
would be interested (for HR) in:

SAP
EHROnline
GIS
Expertfinder
Peoplefinder
PEP
GCS
Personic
Referral platform

Anything I missed team?

As we move forward in the planning stages for NETCO we need to identify all=
 systems which need to be moved or copied into the entity.  We have identif=
ied the great majority of the systems to be moved but we may not be able to=
 identify particular tools used by your group or you individually.  This wo=
uld include spreadsheets etc.

Please send lists of systems and software required to Anne Koehler by close=
 of business today.

To be clear we can (subject to the negotiation) move/copy systems and some =
data however, we CANNOT move either transaction data if counterparty specif=
ic or data obtained from a counterparty under a confidentiality agreement.

For Houston traders, Geof Storey is compiling your lists.

Thanks

Louise
