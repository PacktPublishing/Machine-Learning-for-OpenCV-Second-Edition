Our most important, non-top 20 counterparty in the west is pacificorp (the utility, not ppm).  Pacificorp is the most important counterparty for both our short term northwest an short term southwest desks.  As we allocate scarce margin, please keep this in mind.

FYI...we may want to think about our response to this while keeping in mind that trading values this cp for short-term southwest trading.
