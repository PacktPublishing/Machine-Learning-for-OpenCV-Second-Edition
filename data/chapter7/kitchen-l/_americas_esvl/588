John and Louise						,

I hope that the sample agreements sent to John earlier were what you had in mind.

I have completed all of the amendment and assignment agreements for those persons with the guaranteed bonus.  I will hold on to them until you are ready to fill in the blanks.  A few of those employees work for Enron Canada Corp.  I am not sure if I can transfer them to the other company in light of tax issues.  Nonetheless, those are ready, and we can change the new company name if we set up a Canadian entity in the next few days.

Let me know if you would like any more information.  You can reach me at 3-6401 or on my cell at 713-302-5522.
