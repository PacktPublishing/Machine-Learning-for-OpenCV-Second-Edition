Attached is the proposed technology organization required to take us through the next two weeks as well into a NewCo startup operation.  This was agreed to by Leslie Reeves, Tim Beldon, Stacey White, Steve Nat and Lloyd Will this evening.

Sally please note that several staff were not on this list but your master folders (Dayou & Perlman) were updated by Leslie.  Please note that two EES staff have been selected to provide additional core depth.
