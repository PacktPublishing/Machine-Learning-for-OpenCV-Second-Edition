Confirming names that I gave you over the phone this am (with one addition - for Calgary - and one clarification on volume management):


Gas Risk:		Jeff Gossett

Power Risk:		Stacey White

Documentation & 
Settlements (a) :	Leslie Reeves

Gas Vol Mgmt:		Rita Wynne/Mark McClure (b)

Calgary Ops:		Peggy Hedstrom 



Notes:

(a)	Documentation and Settlements under Leslie Reeves includes power, gas and financial derivatives. 


(b)	Currently, Rita Wynne and Mark McClure co-lead gas volume management.  Bob's plan for NetCo is that Rita Wynne 
	would be in NetCo and that Mark McClure would be on the team to lead volume management for the estate.
