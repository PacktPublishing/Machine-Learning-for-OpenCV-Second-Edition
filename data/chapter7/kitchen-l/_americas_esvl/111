Thanks. Will talk with you tomorrow. One issue that should be discussed is
the timeline that you sent to scott flood earlier today. My guess is that
any bidder will have their own minimum master and contract wording that they
will want to use as well as credit department needs. And so sending out
language to counterparties before a bidder is awarded should be carefully
thought out because it may not be acceptable to the bidder. This is only a
timing issue I think but is important nonetheless.
