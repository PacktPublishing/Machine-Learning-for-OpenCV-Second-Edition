I assume that you have gotten the information regarding proposed bonuses that we discussed.  The list of IT personnel (Development, EOL and Infrstructure) was slow in coming to me.   And once received, when I asked for data from HR on last year's bonus amounts for these people to use as a starting point in the process, it became evident that several persons within HR were on this mission.  Apparently others had been given the same task relative to the IT teams.  Let me know if you did not get what you needed; but it seemed that there were enough hands in this that you should have received the information that you needed -- maybe more than once!  --Sally
