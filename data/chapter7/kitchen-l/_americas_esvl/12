Louise,

Seung-Taek Oh will be working for me as the head of real-time markets in Ercot. As a two year associate he would have been eligible for promotion to manager. He was also an UBS employee and as such was an associate director. I would like to change his title from undefined to associate director.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Doug
