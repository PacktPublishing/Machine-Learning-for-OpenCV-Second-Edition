Louise,

We highlighted the counterparties that we are currently working to reconcile margin amounts.  Other counterparties are listed for whom we might have differences, however in normal business practice we have established a mutual agreement on how to manage their account.  We will be in early in the morning, call us if you have any questions.

Debbie and the "Onicas"
