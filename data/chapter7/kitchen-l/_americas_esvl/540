Please find attached Americas' (physical gas, physical power, and financial trading) accounts receivable aging data.  To interpret the data, use the color codes as follows below.  

Pink indicates that the Settlements group has passed the receivable to our internal legal counsel for review.  Enron's legal action vis a vis the receivable against the counterparty includes notification of delinquency, invitation to negotiation, as well as, but, not necessarily, action through the courts.  
Yellow indicates that Credit is proceeding with an investigation of the receivable claim.
Blue means that a non-cash reconciliation adjustment to the books is being made.  Adjustments are being made for reasons that include accounting entry assignment corrections and physical delivery volume true-ups.
Purple signals a California-related receivable.  Possible outcomes for these amounts include non-cash adjustment and designation as a valid collectible.
Green indicates for the receivable in question that cash has been collected, a non-cash adjustment has been made, or reconciled, but that the receivable has not cleared the register because of the timing of this report.
No color indicates the receivable is less than $200,000 and was not investigated.

For most receivables a synopsis of action or reference has been provided.  

Also included in the file are receivables generated by PG&E.  The physical gas and physical power receivables are over 120 days in arrears and are attributable to March 2001 production (April 2001 collection).

We have provided you this file electronically so that you may see the details and be able to sort and manipulate the data.  A hard copy can be produced.  Tim Proffitt, the Settlement team members, and I are available to sit with you to further investigate our receivable claims and answer any questions you may have regarding the data presented.

Sincerely,
Chris Herron
