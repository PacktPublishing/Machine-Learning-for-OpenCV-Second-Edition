Quick updates: spoke with larry lawyer at egm. Thinks they would take a $30-$40mm p&l hit to liquidate so2 position. Barclays returned our calls suggesting they would think about alternatives incl rolling deal as is and be back to us by 6am. Per deal, if we don't reach agreement by noon, we have to call credits for payment wednesday. Will let you know how call goes in morning. I understand that while bowen signed draw requests on thursday, legal had ok'd. Today, I understand legal is less comfortable. I've got a call into bowen. If he'll sign no issues with barclays. Will give you more shortly.
