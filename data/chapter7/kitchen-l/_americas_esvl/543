Sorry no LC (even under the format below).

Rodney and I are meeting later on today to go through current transactions.  I am sure he will bring this up in more detail on your behalf.

Louise,

I am in town and would like to meet up with you when you get a chance but have a hot question for you.

We have a new steel trade in London that is a back to back where we make $100,000.  It has us issuing an LC but we will be receiving an LC from the purchasers. Note we will get the LC from the purchaser prior to us posting an LC to the producer. If we need to post cash we can discount the LC from the purchaser to post cash. 

I think this meets the objectives but want to check with you. 

thanks and I will set up a time on your schedule.

regards
bruce
