In light of recent events, effective IMMEDIATELY, all usage of the Corporate American Express card is restricted to transactions (approved by your management) for business travel at airline, hotel, car rental and restaurant establishments. Transactions attempted at other establishments will be denied at the point of sale.

Effective Friday, December 7th, ALL charge privileges on ALL Corporate American Express Corporate Cards will be suspended indefinitely. There will be NO charge activity allowed on any Card after close of business on Friday, December 7, 2001.

Enron and each cardholder maintain joint liability on all authorized business related charges on the Corporate American Express card. Each individual cardholder maintains sole liability for non-business related charges.

It is highly recommended that all outstanding and approved business expenses incurred on the American Express Corporate Card be submitted through XMS for reimbursement as soon as incurred.
