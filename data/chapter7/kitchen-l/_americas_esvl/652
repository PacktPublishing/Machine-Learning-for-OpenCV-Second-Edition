I am working on two Master Netting Agreements, El Paso and Duke.
Credit is reviewing a rough draft (w/o credit terms being filled in) of the El Paso Netting Agreement prior to sending it to the counterparty. (I will be coordinating this counterparty with Lisa Mellencamp.)
We are waiting for instructions on which entities and contracts will be included in the Duke Netting Agreement.

Regards,
Brent
