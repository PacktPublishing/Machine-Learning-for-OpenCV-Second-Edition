Standard & Poor's regularly receives inquiries on the treatment of certain =
types of financial contracts, such as commodity swaps and commodity futures=
 contracts, in the event of bankruptcy of one of the parties thereto. These=
 sorts of financial contracts are often used to hedge, or insure against, f=
uture financial liabilities of at least one of the parties. Financial contr=
acts take many forms. Many are executed pursuant to a master agreement, whi=
ch provides for amounts owed from each party to the other to be deducted, o=
r "set-off," so that a single amount will be owed by one party to the other=
. As "risk transfer" mechanisms, financial contracts are an important sourc=
e of market liquidity. Consequently, certain special types of financial con=
tracts have special protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  =20

In general, a bankruptcy filing triggers an "automatic stay" that restrains=
 creditors from taking actions against the debtor or its property. As a res=
ult of the automatic stay, creditors in general cannot exercise contractual=
 remedies, such as the exercise of set-off and close-out rights, without th=
e permission of the bankruptcy court. Because of the importance of financia=
l contracts, however, Congress provided that the liquidity of the swap and =
commodity markets would not be disrupted by the bankruptcy of participants =
by exempting certain qualifying financial contracts from the automatic stay=
. In appropriate cases, therefore, the nonbankrupt party's contractual righ=
t to set off amounts owed to it under a particular financial contract again=
st cash, securities, or other property of the bankrupt party held by or due=
 from the nonbankrupt party is protected notwithstanding the bankruptcy of =
the counterparty.  =20

Business dealings, of course, often result in more complicated issues than =
can be addressed by a straightforward application of black-letter law. The =
following are some of the questions that investors have asked about set-off=
 and netting of liabilities under financial contracts:  =20

Q: What types of financial contract can be set-off or netted?  =20

A: Financial contracts that qualify as protected contracts under the Code c=
an be netted. Financial contracts must fall within certain definitions in t=
he Code to qualify as protected contracts. The Code also requires that such=
 contracts must be between particular types of entities, such as commoditie=
s brokers, financial institutions, stockbrokers, etc., in order for the fin=
ancial contract to be protected under the Code.  =20

Q: In a situation where Party "A" and Party "B" have entered into several d=
ifferent financial contracts with each other, can Party A net its "in the m=
oney" obligations against its "out of the money" obligations if Party B goe=
s bankrupt?  =20

A: With respect to financial contracts that are protected contracts under t=
he Code definitions (and which by their terms permit termination and liquid=
ation), Party A may terminate the contract, liquidate collateral, and net o=
ut any termination values. Pursuant to Code sections 555, 556, 559, and 560=
, these rights are not subject to the automatic stay, and cannot be avoided=
 or otherwise limited under the Code or by the bankruptcy court in a reorga=
nization or a liquidation.  =20

Furthermore, Code section 362, which establishes the automatic stay, create=
s specific exceptions from the stay for set off of mutual claims under comm=
odity contracts and set off of mutual claims under swaps that constitute th=
e set off of a claim against the debtor for a "margin payment" or "settleme=
nt payment". However, the stay does apply to "cross-product" set-offs--swap=
 claims against commodity contracts claims, for example. For cross-product =
set-offs, Code section 553 provides that set-off rights are not affected by=
 bankruptcy but are subject to the automatic stay. Permission from the bank=
ruptcy court, therefore, is necessary before Party B could exercise its con=
tractual set-off rights across different types of financial contracts. Set-=
off, in other words, is not automatic in these circumstances. Although cros=
s-product netting may not be protected from the automatic stay, Party B is =
still treated as a secured creditor to the extent of its set-off rights.  =
=20

Q: In what circumstances could a bankruptcy court rescind a netting of swap=
 or commodities claim?  =20

A: Grounds for contesting set-off may include the failure of a particular f=
inancial contract to qualify as a protected contract under the Code, or the=
 failure of a particular financial contract to permit set-off.  =20

Q: Aside from any netting benefits realized by Party A against Party B, whe=
re does Party A stand with respect to amounts owed to it under the financia=
l contract that have not been realized through set-off?  =20

A: After termination, liquidation, and set-off, Party A will have an unsecu=
red claim against Party B.  =20

Q: Are payments made by a debtor prior to bankruptcy under swaps or commodi=
ty contracts at risk of being clawed back as a preferential transfer or fra=
udulent conveyance?  =20

A: Generally, no. Code section 546 provides that the bankruptcy trustee may=
 not avoid any prepetition margin or settlement payment made by or to a com=
modity broker, forward contract merchant, stockbroker, financial institutio=
n, or securities clearing agency; or any prepetition transfer under a swap =
agreement made by or to a swap participant as a preferential transfer or fr=
audulent conveyance, except where such payments are made with actual intent=
 to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors.  =20

Q: In a situation where Party B goes bankrupt and there are financial contr=
acts between Party A and Party B, where Party B is in the money; between Pa=
rty B and Party C where Party C is in the money; and between Party C and Pa=
rty A where Party A is in the money, can Party C set off its payment to Par=
ty A to the extent of its claim against Party B?  =20

A: No. Set-off in bankruptcy is only possible where "mutuality" exists (i.e=
., one party must owe a debt to another party); that other party must owe a=
 debt to the first party. As a result, Party A's claim will belong to the b=
ankruptcy estate of Party B while Party C will be a general creditor of Par=
ty B. No set-off will be permitted in these circumstances.  =20
