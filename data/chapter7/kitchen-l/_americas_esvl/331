Kalen/David-

What are the facts surrounding this process? Surely what is outlined below can't be accurate...if it is- we need to figure out what can be done to shorten the timeframe. Please respond directly to Sabra L. Dinari and copy me.

Thanks.

Hi all,

I just got off the phone with the Benefits Center and they are informing people that it could take up to 90 days for them to send "termination packages" out to these employees and then you can send in your forms and it will take another 30 days to get a check, specifically talking about the Cash Balance Plan money.  This all happens AFTER they get a notice that you are terminated which they usually process on the 1st....come on, what is up with this???  It could very well take up to 5 months for people to get a check in their hands?  That is not right.  Since all of you have a lot more clout than me or any of the terminated employees, I'm hoping that someone will take this up with Human Resources or whomever to get this form downloadable or something to speed up this process.

Thanks.

Sabra Dinari
