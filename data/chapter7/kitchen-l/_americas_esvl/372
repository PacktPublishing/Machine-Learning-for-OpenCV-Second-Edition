In speaking with Constellation this morning (trying to assign some of our New England deals to them), they said they had heard that Enron was establishing a data room in Houston for the purpose of selling off its book of business (in fact they indicated they were sending a team down today).  To that end, they are highly interested in speaking with someone about the book from a macro level.  Please let me know who I should have them call.  Otherwise, the contact there is Sarah Wright at 410-468-3483.   I'm at 978-449-9936 if you'd like to discuss

John
