Subject:	RE: Dynegy Master Netting/Sithe

The MNA covers form commodity and trading agreements entered into between specified Dynegy and Enron entities.  I spoke with Sheila Tweed (who did the Sithe deal) about this and  we got comfortable that no aspects of the Sithe deal were done under the form trading agreements or between the specified entities.  In addition, the Enron Corp. Guaranty that will be used in connection with the MNA will not supersede the Enron Corp. Guaranty issued in connection with the Sithe transaction.

Harlan:
Can you send me an e-mail explaining how the Sithe contract (which I know nothing about) is not part of the Dynegy MNA?  Thanks.
