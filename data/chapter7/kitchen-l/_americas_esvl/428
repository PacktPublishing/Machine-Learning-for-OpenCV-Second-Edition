Please be advised that Ron has reached agreement on the Doyle insurance claim, which will bring in cash of $1.375 million (including income of approximately $700k). We are pushing to make sure this happens as soon as possible, hopefully within the next day. The e-mail from FM Global (the insurance company) is attached below. 

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Ron,

Please be advised that the settlement numbers you have outlined below are
acceptable to us , and the remaining net amount of $1,375,000 will be
processed for payment. We do not normally make payment by wire transfer, but
as I indicated to Jim Bouillion earlier today I am making inquiries to
determine if it can be done on this loss. I may have an answer for you this
afternoon.

Thank you and Jim for your assistance in resolving this matter

Regards / Russ Whitt
