Here are the current items and projected disbursements in E-Next for plant development.

1. Ft Pierce HRSG is an option payment. Once the option is exercised, I believe the remaining payments would be made over the following 12 month period.
2. Longview Turbines: We continue to make progress payments. I believe the payments will be completed over the following 12 months as well.
3. Cascade Agreement/Transformer: Awaiting Notice to Proceed. Cascade will be paid over 4 months. Transformer over 1 year.
