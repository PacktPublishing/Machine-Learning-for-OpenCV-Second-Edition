Consensus now is that ALL gas and power systems and IP for trading will be put in Newco.  Enron will maintain all of its own systems and IP to support gas, power and all other commodoties.  Problem is this requires additional IT people immediately and may require additional hardware.  Think 50 additional workers for 1 to 2 months and $2 to $5 million for hardware.  Alternative is to provide Newco what it needs, get services back for gas and power and go dark on all remaining commodities (coal, etc.).
