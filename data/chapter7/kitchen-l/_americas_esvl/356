Subject:	DIP Financing and other Cash Flows

Attached is the spreadsheet we talked about on the phone. The numbers in the sheet represent what was shown to the DIP lenders last 
weekend in order to obtain  financing. In many cases all revenues and other items were completely eliminated leaving only operating expense and 
capital expenditures. We were trying to be as conservative as possible but also show a viable entity going forward. I hope we were not to far off.

What we would like you to do is populate this format with the numbers you believe to be true going forward based on the recent changes. We also need a detailed 
explanation of what is in the numbers. A few things to remember are:

	This estimate should contain no allocations except for what you believe you salaries and wages would be post reduction (normally paid by Corp)

	Operating expenses includes salaries, outside services, benefits, employee expenses and any other items normally in operating expenses including 
		non employee expenses and taxes other than income taxes.  Please provide as much detail as possible.  There is space for detailed opex at 		the bottom of the page.Call me if you have questions.

	Although in Chapter 11 interest and income taxes are not paid, please provide these to the extent your business unit pays them. We will adjust for 
		entities that are in the filing.

	I understand there is a big global effort to identify assets for sale but please provide your best estimate to date along with the detail and we will 		compare to the global effort.

	Capex and investing should be mandatory only. Please provide detail back up.
	
	To the extent your business has any financing activities please provide. again we will adjust for filing entities.

	We need this as soon as possible but no later than Friday morning 9:00 am.

This should be a realistic view of your business unit as run under Chapter 11. We are only focused on CASH items now. Please provide backup detail for any 
item you think needs it or is not self evident. Please do not hesitate to call myself 57852 or Greg Adams 33887 with questions.

Shortly this format will be expanded to weekly for Dec'01 and 13 weeks of 2002 with monthly through the remainder of 2002. This is the attachment 
that was suppose to be attached to the email from Rick Causey. Below is a list of the CAO' s / Leads and what entities they are responsible for.

	Wes Colwell - ENA, NetCo, EBS, EPI and EEOS	
	Rod Hayslett - ETS (without Northern), Northern, Clean Fuels, PGE and EREC
