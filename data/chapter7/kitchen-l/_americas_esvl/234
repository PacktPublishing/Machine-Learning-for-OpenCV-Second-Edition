----Protect your name----
Register.com will help you protect your .com, .net or .org
name with SafeRenew(TM) automatic domain renewal service.  We
will notify you when your name is up for expiration, and if
you can't get back to us before that date, we will attempt to
automatically renew your name for a one-year term.
Please make sure that your billing information is up to date,
as you will need a valid credit card on record to take
advantage of this service.  When we renew your name we will
automatically charge your credit card on file at the current
renewal price.
