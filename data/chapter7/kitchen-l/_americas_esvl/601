Louise, we may also have a buyer for our entire Ontario operation (staff + contracts). As you know, we have a ton of contracts/alliances that have never been marked as they are conditional on market opening. It would be a crying shame to have all of those terminate. By cc to peter, please see Louise to explain further.
