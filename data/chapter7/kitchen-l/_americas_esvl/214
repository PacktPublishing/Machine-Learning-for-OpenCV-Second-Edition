The distribution has been created - DL-NETCO.  However, is it possible for me to ask Tammie to enter all the names?  The HR generalists are meeting with all of the department heads to make sure that we communicate to their employees that they have been identified for NETCO so we are a bit short of resources this morning.

Thanks - 
Amy
