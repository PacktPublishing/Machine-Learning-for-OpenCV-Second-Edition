Enron North America and Enron Canada are still providing IT and Back Office=
 Services to several parties.  Beth has expressed some concerns about the e=
state's ability to be able to support  a production trading environment onc=
e a split of applications and hardware is made between NETCO and the estate=
.  Given this we need to make some decisions as to how to best handle these=
 services agreements.  Here are some suggestions:

Peggy Hedstrom, in Calgary would like to assign the Enron Canada Master Ser=
vices agreements to NETCO and continue to service those via that entity.

Bridgeline, which is a JV in which ENA owns a 40% interest, currently has n=
o way that they can support themselves.  They are totally dependent on Enro=
n for everything from email, internet, network services and office applicat=
ions as well as trading, risk and back office applications.  If there are c=
oncerns about the estate's ability to support Bridgeline then it may be in =
Enron's best interest to assign this agreement to NETCO.

AEP/HPL is more of a stand alone operation.  They have their own infrastruc=
ture in place and currently provide for their own email and office support =
services.  They have also brought up with their own version of our SCADA sy=
stem and are in the process of trying to bring up their own version of our =
Pipeline Operations system.  If we sell them our version of PGAS to support=
 their measurement operations they will then try to tie these applications =
into their own Trade Blotter, Open Link Financials and Altra.  Their goal w=
as to try and have all of this in place by sometime in June of this year.  =
Given all of the Commercial conflicts with AEP regarding the sale of HPL it=
 may make the most sense to leave this agreement with the estate and sugges=
t that AEP try to be stand alone ASAP.  That way if the estate defaults on =
the service agreement then they can at least manually rekey information fro=
m one system to another until they have put in their own integration betwee=
n the applications listed above.

Please let me know if you have any comments or if it makes sense to put tog=
ether a meeting to discuss the issues of Service Agreements.

The AEP and Bridgeline deals must be investigated.  There is no way the est=
ate can support a production environment.  I will be reviewing the contract=
s to determine our obligations and possible alternatives.

Key Planning Assumptions
1) Jan 20 go live
2) New Co Conversions must be completed and tested by application teams by =
Jan 15. This assumes all major production data setup - users, rights, books=
, global data - is completed and tested on a per application basis. Some co=
de changes may still be in process but integration testing can begin to ens=
ure the applications still talk to each other.=20
3) Integration test planning focus will be to run representative transactio=
ns from EOL to SAP through all core trading applications to ensure that app=
lications and interfaces still work. We will not be testing functional perm=
utations, data conditions, validation or exceptions to any significant degr=
ee.=20
4) Each application conversion team must test their changes before approvin=
g their changes for integration testing. We are operating from the premise =
that data, infrastructure and code changes have been tested at a applicatio=
n system level before the enterprise integration test starts.=20
4) All systems will be physically split (even Unify at this point).=20
5) Integration test team will develop and execute the test plan for both Es=
tate and New Co.=20
6) We will integrate key business reps into the process for planning and ex=
ecution and they will have shared responsibility for signoff on the test to=
 support go live to production.=20
7) We will minimize the differentiation between New Co and Estate for conve=
rsion and test team purposes. There are two teams - Conversion and Integrat=
ion Test. Each team will focus on both Estate and New Co. Resources are too=
 tight and the process is too inefficient to separate responsibility.=20
8) Estate conversions must happen at the application level before New Co co=
nversion work can begin in earnest. Estate conversion is on the critical pa=
th for New Co.=20


Key Issues
1) We will push to get a decision to see if we can focus on financial tradi=
ng first, then physical. If financial is the focus, delivery risk goes down=
 dramatically. For now, we must plan on the worst case -- physical and fina=
ncial on Jan 20.=20
2) We need both a dev and a test environment for all systems that support A=
EP and Bridgeline in Estate. This means that we need a dev environment (and=
 HW gap addressed) for Unify, Sitara, CPR, TAGG/ERMS. Conversion teams need=
 to coordinate with infrastructure immediately on this issue to make sure w=
e're in synch.=20
3) Unify servers probably can't be owned by New Co while running a single l=
icense of Unify.=20
4) Some systems are using 'short name' instead of Duns ID as a key for coun=
terparties from Global. The Global, TAGG / ERMS, Unify and SAP reps must qu=
ickly define the best approach for making global data changes and minimizin=
g hard coded reference id risks.=20
5) We must clearly define limits of conversion and test scope to hit these =
potential dates. We must focus on core systems with only core changes requi=
red to support day one trading.=20
6) We can only convert Estate over the weekend due to AEP / Bridgeline cons=
iderations. The time window will be very small.=20

e foundation assumptions, context, team and approach for integration test. =

b Saleem.=20
7) Completed. Contact Bob Hall, Leslie Reeves, Bob Superty, Brice Baxter to=
 communicate above and set up meeting to begin planning with them on the in=
tegration testing process. Owner: Jeff Johnson
8) Due 12/21.  Refine core system list with IT owners and Business owners f=
or integration test purposes. Owner: Iain Greig.=20
