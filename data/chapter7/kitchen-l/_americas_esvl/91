Hi Ursula,
 
I'll ask Bob Hillier to find out who our Legato contact is.  Clearly, we need this backup software on day 1.  We will also look into the Rational relationship.  It is not as critical as it is used for development (we have licenses for Rose and for ClearCase and ClearQuest).

Hi Louise / Jay 

If you can help shed any light on your vendor relationship with Legato 
and Rational, and whether you believe there is scope for reviewing 
these licenses with a view to changing the relevant license agreements, 
that would be extremely helpful.  We understand that both these 
products would be critical components to running the Netco systems. 

Thx 
Ursula

Thanks Bert.  As promised, I am following up with E Company on the 
various 
assigned agreements that prohibit providing service to a third party.  
Feel 
free to have Ursula pursue the question simultaneously.  I am also 
looking 
into what services the parties intend Fire to provide for transition as 
this is not a part of the transaction that I have been following 
closely to 
date. 

Roger

     The two licenses are: 

     1.  Enterprise Software License Agreement between Legato 
Systems, Inc. and [E] Corp, dated as of Sept. 27, 2001, respecting 
numerous software products generally branded with the names 
NetWorker, GEMS, Celestra, Octopus and others.  Section 2.2 
provides:  "Restrictions on Use.  Licensee shall not, and shall 
not aid, abet or permit any third party to: . . . (iii) . . . use 
for timesharing or service bureau purposes or otherwise use . . . 
the Software . . . for the benefit of third parties . . . ." 

     2.  Products License Agreement #3185 Modified for [E] 
Corp, issued by Ration Software Corp., dated as of Feb. 17, 1998, 
respecting various software products branded Clearcase, Rational, 
Purify, and Quantify and others.  Section 1.1 provides:  "General 
Grant of License. . . . You may not rent, lease or use the Product 
in a service bureau capacity. . . . ." 

     We continue to review the agreements for the Service 
Bureau issue as it is the most pressing from a time perspective. 
We have already found several ambiguous licenses and will bring 
those to your attention as a group later. 

     If other express provisions such as the above turn up, I 
will let you know on a case by case basis as this issue is one our 
IT personnel are taking seriously. 

     Bert
