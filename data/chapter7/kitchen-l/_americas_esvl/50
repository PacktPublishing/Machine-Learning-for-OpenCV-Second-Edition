Have a few questions on the list of key personnel you gave to me

1.	There is a "Will" listed - sorry but I don't see anyone with
this last name in my list.
2.	There is a "Woulfe" listed - I couldn't find this so I presumed
this to be "Wolf" - am I correct.
3.	Also, there were a few people on your list who are analysts or
trading assistants - rotation 2.  Is it correc that these are people we
would deem key, ie., potential provide incentives to stay in order to
ensure the business' success?
4.	Brad Mackay was listed twice - FYI

Many thanks

Colette
