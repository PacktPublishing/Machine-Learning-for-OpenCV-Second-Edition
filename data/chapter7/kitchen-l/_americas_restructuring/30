Brian

Attached is Mr. Lydecker's spreadsheet where I have added the basis for the HPL and LRC assets to be included in Special Assets plus those that will be leased or sold to AEP.  I was not sure if you wanted anything in the market value columns so I have only provided book values or investment basis amounts.  We can further breakdown the HPL and LRC assets into the components that Lydecker is breaking them into by Friday.  I also provided the buy-out values for Looper and MidTexas and for your reference just to account for everything I also added Jean's balances at the bottom below the Special Assets totals.  Call me on my cell phone if you have questions.  713-825-7240.
