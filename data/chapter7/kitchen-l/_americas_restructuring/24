The biweekly April 13th report is on its way to you.  I would like to draw =
your attention to the status summaries for IHI and Canfibre.  IHI and Canfi=
bre are second to none in the portfolio as quagmires in which we have had t=
o manufacture any bit of leverage to protect Enron's interests.  These comp=
anies have been extremely uncooperative and more often than not have been w=
orking adversely to Enron.   We are in the position of playing poker with a=
bsolutely nothing whatsoever "in the hole".  Normally I try to highlight cr=
edit to the appropriate individuals in Special Assets when a transaction ac=
tually closes.  In both these cases, however, I would like to make you awar=
e that John Enerson is doing an excellent job handling the deal complexitie=
s and applying persuasion, strong-arm, threats and any and all other method=
s to optimize value.  There is not a lot of glamor working these turkeys.  =
Nothing is certain until we have cash in the bank, but I believe we may be =
seeing a little light at the end of the tunnel where there had been only ab=
yss. John deserves a great deal of credit.  Dick.
