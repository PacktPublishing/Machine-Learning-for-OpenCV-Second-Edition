These are the events that took place concerning the New York Customer Holiday Event:

In order to reserve rooms for the first weekend in NY at the Four Seasons, I have to book no later than 9 months out.
To hold these rooms, a contract had to be signed and a $15,000 deposit sent.  The contract allowed us to cancel the entire event by the end of July with no penalty and the deposit was fully refundable.
In speaking with Dave Duran and Frank Vickers in May, they wanted to proceed with this event. ( Attached is a memo that I sent to Frank Vickers outlining the cancellation policy.)
The cost estimate went through several revisions and the final was sent to you for your approval in July.
After the approval form was rejected, I spoke with Dave Duran and he was planning to revise his guest list and re-submit the approval form.
I talked to both Frank and Dave numerous times and reminded them of the hotel penalty issues and had not heard back from either one until I received an e-mail on September 20th from Frank canceling his portion of the trip.
I called my Four Seasons national sales rep and she is working with NY in canceling the contract and minimizing the hotel liquidated damages.  I should have an answer from her no later than tomorrow.

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this in more detail.
Thanks.

As I never approved this, I just wondered if the rumours were true that we did spend money on this trip.

Let me know

Thanks
