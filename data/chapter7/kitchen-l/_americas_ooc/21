Interesting reading.  Here's a quote:
Fastow's expert balancing act, in fact, has earned him this year's CFO Excellence Award for Capital Structure Management. "We needed someone to rethink the entire financing structure at Enron from soup to nuts," says Jeffrey K. Skilling, Enron president and chief operating officer. "We didn't want someone stuck in the past, since the industry of yesterday is no longer. Andy has the intelligence and the youthful exuberance to think in new ways. He deserves every accolade tossed his way."
