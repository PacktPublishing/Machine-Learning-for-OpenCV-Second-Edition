Karen:  I was out of town yesterday, and am just now getting your message.  I will give you a call this morning to discuss.  The thing that concerns me the most is the reference to "inside view"-----if they have not talked to anyone at Enron, or don't attribute the "inside view" to some credible former Enron person, then it is misleading to call it an "inside view".  Absent false statements or breaches of confidentiality, if this is nothing more than someone's opinion of Enron and how it operates, then we probably can't stop them (I'm surprised that there is not more of this "stuff").  It would definately be helpful to get a copy of the report (even if we have to pay for it); without knowing what it says, it would be hard to say what action we can take. I will give you a call and we can discuss.  Thanks, Rex.

Rex -- Apparently this organization is attempting to sell this report about Enron that's purported to be an "inside view."  I called this morning and they never talked to anyone inside the company.  The president of the company is supposed to call me back -- I want to get a copy of this report.  But I wanted to send to you anyway.  Is there anything we can do to prevent them from marketing this? 

Thanks!

Karen-

I'm apparently on some spam email list.  Do you have any idea who these jokers are or have any interest in seeing what's on this report?

Mike

?	The keys to structuring Enron type "risk free" transactions
?	How to negotiate with Enron
