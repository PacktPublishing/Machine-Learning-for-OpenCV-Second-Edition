JOHN LAVORATO
"For the Record"


In just over 8 fast-paced years, John Lavorato has evolved from an MBA student at Northwestern University to president and CEO of Enron Americas.  Joining Enron in 1993 as an associate, he moved up the ranks quickly. He moved to Calgary and performed many functions for Enron Canada that included leading the trading operation from January 1995 and the origination business from January 1998.  After successfully growing the Canadian trading and origination business into a major contributor to Enron Corp., he was named president and CEO of Enron Canada Corp in 1999.
