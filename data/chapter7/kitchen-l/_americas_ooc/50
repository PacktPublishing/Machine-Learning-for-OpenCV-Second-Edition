Louise, 
I sent these out last night per John's instructions.  I have been receiving updates all morning.  Churns need to be completed this week for the project team to remain on schedule.  These are the most up to date; if I have received an update I have indicated it with "-c" by the group name.

If you are on this distribution you have been identified by John and Louise as the responsible party for signing off on the ECS 6th floor.  Your assistants and other key people  have done a great job of managing the floor plans so far and we're on the home stretch.  John made some group location changes today and a final review/update is required before churns are submitted this week.

Please take a moment to review the locations of your people and place them in the appropriate seats within your group (best printed on 11 x 17 paper)   Note that desks 858-860, 651-652, 658-660, 662-667 and 705-715 will not be available on Day 1, temporary replacement seats are assigned in the lower right hand of the spread sheet, if the lag time will be over two weeks.  

Kindly return this at your earliest convenience on Thursday, confirming your approval of the names and seat assignments.  I am also including the most current version of the 5th floor for your information.

Call me if you have any questions and thank you.
