SATURDAY ACTIVITY
MOUNTAIN BIKING (10:00 am - 2:00 pm)
Each guest will be provided with a mountain bike (equipped with full front and rear suspension), helmet and a trail map.  Pedal toe clips are available upon request.  Included in this activity is a full day pass on the Centennial Chair Lift (a four person detachable quad) located at the main base of Beaver Creek Mountain.  Trails are clearly marked and are categorized in the following manner:
Green - Beginner
Blue - Intermediate
Black Diamond - Advanced
The green and blue trails are wide dirt roads.  The black diamond routes are single track trails.
It takes approximately 25 minutes to complete an intermediate trail; 15 minutes for the chair lift and 10 minutes for the bike trail.  Guests are at their leisure to tackle as many trails as they wish.
Guides will be provided along the various routes for assistance and bike maintenance.
