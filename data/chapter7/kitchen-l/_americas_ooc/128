I've confirmed that the 1/2 block on the east side of the Kids' Center will be vacated by Clark Construction in January. That will give us time to see what kind of a problem we may have and to develop sketches and pricing on alternate drop off arrangements.

I met Savita Puthagai a couple of days ago and (without me saying a word to her on the issue) she told me that she is not moving her child to the kid's center due to the problematic parking.  

So its not just me!
