Dear John, 

 My colleagues and I are working with Australian Power  and Energy Limited (APEL) that is developing a $3 billion synfuel and power  plant project in the Latrobe Valley of Australia in Victoria using brown  coal.

 The power plant project will be 1,000 MW.  Part of the synfuel production will be  clean-burning diesel fuel of about 35,000 barrels a day (worth about  $400,000,000 a year at today's prices).

 APEL was wondering whether Enron could have an interest  in marketing the power and/or the diesel fuel.  APEL also would be open to suggestions  should Enron wish to be involved in other ways.

 The principals APEL are in Houston this week and could  meet with Enron this Thursday afternoon, 19 July.  

 John, would or your colleagues like to meet with APEL  this Thursday, and if so, what time and where would be convenient?

 Thanks and Best Regards,

 Don Reid
