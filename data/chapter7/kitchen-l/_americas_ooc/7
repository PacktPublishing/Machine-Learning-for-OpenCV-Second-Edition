Louise,

Sempra Energy has called and asked to "cover' outstanding positions with Enron.
They have done some deals with me this morning via EOL, as well as a "sleeve" with EPNG in order to minimize their exposure with us.  Indications were that they have longer dated power and other gas positions that they want to minimize as well,  I advised them to call the respected traders first, as apposed to calling voice brokers,  to see what they can facilitate.
