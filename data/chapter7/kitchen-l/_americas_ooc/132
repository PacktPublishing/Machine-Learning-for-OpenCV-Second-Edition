Louise -- Just got a call from Pattie Sellers with Fortune magazine.  They'd like to change your panel for the October conference -- instead of speaking on "Navigating Globally," they'd like you to speak on the panel, "Pushing the Boundaries."  It's a more high-profile panel -- it opens the session on Thursday morning.  Other speakers include Andrea Jung, CEO of Avon, and Lynn Forester, co-CEO/Chairman of FirstMark Communications (she raised $1 billion in private equity and is building a broadband network in Europe.)  Maria Bartiromo of CNBC will be the moderator.

I think you should agree to participate in this panel instead.  Let me know what you think.

Thanks!
Karen
