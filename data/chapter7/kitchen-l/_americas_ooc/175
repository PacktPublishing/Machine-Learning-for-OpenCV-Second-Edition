I am aware of multiple emails circulating within Enron regarding this project.  We have previously met with Alan Blood et.al. in Sydney regarding this project and expressed our level of interest by letter (attached).  Should you feel that there has been significant progress since our last meeting, then we welcome an updated presentation.  

Regards

Paul Quilkey
