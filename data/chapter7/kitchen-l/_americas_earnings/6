Lousie,
My group gathers the gas and power physical volumes that are used in quarte=
rly press releases, SEC filings and other communications.  Investor relatio=
ns typically likes to look at this information on a monthly basis to make s=
ure that they understand the direction that volumes are going.  The attache=
d file details gas and power volumes by region for the most recent periods.=
  The gas volumes from July to August of this year show a slight downward t=
rend that I wanted to make sure that you were aware of.  We pull this infor=
mation from the Unify settlement system and have rarely had problems with t=
he accuracy of that data.  None the less, we typically run it by desk heads=
 when the numbers don't seem to fit our expectations.  After a brief review=
 by the Central and East guys they told us that lower price volatility and =
the ICE trading platform were the significant reasons for the decline.  Is =
this in line with your expectations?  Power volumes on the other hand are u=
p considerably in August.  We have not received a response on that yet.

Please call me if you would like to discuss.
