John,

After reviewing the P&L from 09/04, Anne Bike discovered that she allocated the cumulative transport model loss for 09/04, when she should have simply allocated the change for the day.  The change for the day was a positive 657,000 and the cumulative for the month was a negative 4,058,586.  The correction will be made today for a positive 4,716,388.

Thanks,
Mike
