> I am having trouble responding to email remotely.  Regarding your question
> about progress on CGAS, we have initiated the third party engineering
> review process required under the Brazos facility.  Indications are that
> it will be completed before September 30.  Other due diligence has
> commenced as well.  A marketing brochure has been drafted and should be
> complete in the next two weeks.  John Thompson has a meeting scheduled for
> next week with the existing prospective buyer to determine if the buyer is
> going to close the proposed transaction.  I will keep you posted.  I can
> be reached at Mariner @ 281-584-8306.
