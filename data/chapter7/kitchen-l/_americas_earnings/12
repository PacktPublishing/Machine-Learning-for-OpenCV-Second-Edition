Deal Update:

Las Vegas:  Meetings and site visits scheduled with Northland, Black Hills and Allegheny.  All have registered a lot of time on Dealbench.  Northland brought there investment bankers (CIBC) to Portland and hired an independent engineering firm.  We will have the info memorandum prepared this week tosend out to other potential purchasers if necessary.  Still on track.

AMPS: We are negotiating with two industrials, each can take the first two units.  Oregon Steel in Portland and Geneva Steel in Utah.  Geneva is a better site (permitting and infrastructure).  High elevation in Utah will derate the output of the units, but will likely be able to run most hours.  Oregon interconnects with Portland General (good) but permit will restrict hours (3,500 hours estimate).  We need to talk this week to discuss the form of the contract and value/risk transfer between ENA and AMPS.

Wind:	We completed a term sale to Edwards Air Force Base consisting of shaped energy and green tags.  Tags came from our existing biomass tags and Texas wind.  We will purchase the balance from Pacificorp.  We expect more activity here with other feds, some of the munis and 6-7 developers that we are working with.

Generator Tolls: We are trading term sheets with Allegheny, Reliant, Idacorp, Dynegy, NRG and Constellation re our offer to sell at NP-15, Mid-C and Palo - I think we will get something done this quarter.

Longview: We met with the head of BPA this week and got confirmation that he supports our Longview process and that his agency will not slow us down with their proposed regional air study.  Finding EPC contractors has been difficult so we may start discussions with NEPCO.

DWR: Should execute the Master agreement this week which will allow short-term deals with 7 day payment.
