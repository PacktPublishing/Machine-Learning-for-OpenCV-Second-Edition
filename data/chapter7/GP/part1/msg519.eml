Dear Sir<BR>
RE: ASSISTANCE REQUIRED FOR ACQUISITION OF ESTATES.<BR>
I write to inform you of my desire to acquire estates or landed =
properties in your country on behalf of myself, IGNATIUS CHOMBO being =
the Honourable Minister, for LOCAL GOVERNMENT, PUBLIC WORKS AND NATIONAL =
HOUSING and of course the Director of Contracts and Finance Allocation =
of the<BR>
Federal Ministry of Works and Housing in Zimbabwe.<BR>
<BR>
Considering this very strategic and influential position, we would want =
this transaction to be strictly as confidential as possible. We further =
want our identity to remain undisclosed at least for now, until the =
completion of the transaction. Hence our desire to have an overseas =
agent. We want you represent us in this transaction so as to ensure our =
offshore reserve is kept out of international glare because, you would =
been aware that the EUROPEAN NATIONS, BRITAIN and of course the UNITED =
STATES has slammed sanctions on ZIMBABWE and as such our accounts might =
be frozen in the nearest future.<BR>
<BR>
I have therefore been directed to inquire if you would agree to act as =
our overseas agent in order to actualise this transaction. The deal in =
brief is that the funds with which to carry out our proposed investments =
in your country is presently in a coded account an apex financial =
institution in Europe which of course I would make known to you in due =
course and we need your assistance to transfer the funds to your country =
or any safe account outside your country in a convenient bank account =
that will be provided by you before we can put the funds into use. For =
this you shall be considered to have executed a contract for the =
ministry. The contract sum of which shall run into US$15.5Million of =
which your share shall be 30% if you agree to be our overseas agent. =
Your area of specialisation does not matter in this transaction, all =
that is required of you is a safe account and your willingness to assist =
us acquire estates in your country.<BR>
<BR>
As soon as payment is effected and the amount mentioned above is =
successfully transferred into your account, we intend to use our own =
share in acquiring some estates abroad. For this too, you shall serve as =
our agent. It might interest you to note that last year, a similar =
transaction was carried out with one MR. CHIENCHEN YU of Taiwan but =
after securing the payment approvals, and payment effected, MR.CHIENCHEN =
YU changed his numbers and addresses, and was no where to be found on =
our getting to Taiwan. That was how we lost US$7.5Million. So this time =
around, I will be represented in Europe with you before the remittance =
is made into your provided account to avoid future occurrence and allow =
trust to play a very minimal role until performance is seen.<BR>
<BR>
You are requested to communicate your acceptance or otherwise of this =
proposal, through my email address. After which we shall discuss in =
details the modalities for seeing this transaction through. If however, =
you are not disposed to assist, kindly destroy this letter in view of =
the confidentiality of the proposed transaction and interest of =
personalities involved.<BR>
<BR>
Thank you in anticipation of your co-operation.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Best Regards,<BR>
<BR>
