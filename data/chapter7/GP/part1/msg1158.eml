&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;p align=3D&quot;left&quot;&gt;This =
week StockPower explores WiFi. WiFi lets you connect to the Internet =
without wires, providing broadband access via hot spots in hotels, =
convention centers, corporate apartments, campuses and other places. =
&lt;/p&gt;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;p =
align=3D&quot;left&quot;&gt;According to a recent In-Stat study, the =
number of wireless subscribers is expected to jump from 1.5 billion at =
the end of 2004 to over 2.5 billion in 2009. StockPower compares this =
growth to the cell phone industry that freed users from land lines. The =
global mobile telephone business reached $414 billion in 2003&nbsp; a =
tenfold increase in the decade since 1993. The International =
Telecommunication Union reports mobile phone subscriber growth outpacing =
fixed lines. &lt;/p&gt;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;p align=3D&quot;left&quot;&gt;One =
company StockPower believes fits a solid WiFi business profile is =
RoomLinX. &lt;/p&gt;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;p =
align=3D&quot;left&quot;&gt;RoomLinX caters to the WiFi hotel industry =
that In-Stat reports achieving rising demand since the concept emerged =
five years ago. With deployments and revenues climbing in 2004, current =
projections place the number of deployed hotel properties as growing =
from little more than 5,000 in 2003 to nearly 30,000 in 2008. =
&lt;/p&gt;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;p align=3D&quot;left&quot;&gt;Will =
RoomLinX diversify into universities and other venues&nbsp; alleviating =
the need to hard-wire Internet expansion? Time will tell. &lt;/p&gt;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;p =
align=3D&quot;left&quot;&gt;RoomLinX is publicly traded on the OTC BB =
Exchange, under the symbol RMLX.OB. &lt;/p&gt;<BR>
