Good day Sir/Madam,<BR>
<BR>
On Sunday December 26th at about 9:00 am, the world witnessed a natural =
disaster. A quake measuring 9.0 on the ritcher scale occurred at the =
bottom of the Indian Ocean close to the Island of Sumatra, North East =
Indonesia.Resulting Tsunamis from the quake caused destruction of lives =
and properties never before experienced in modern history. Reports say =
this is the strongest quake in 40 years with its energy equal to 9,500 =
Hiroshima bombs.<BR>
So far 123,175 people have been officially reported dead, of this figure =
27 are Britons, 79,900 Indonesians and 27,268 from Sri Lanka. India =
recorded over 6,000 dead and Thailand over 10,000. The Swedish Prime =
Minister says about 1,000 Swedish tourists have died so far, and the =
death toll is still on the increase.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The British public has so far donated 21million pounds, with 10million =
raised overnight. The British government has also pledged 15million =
pounds; the EU has pledged $4m dollars and other International =
organizations pledging sums of money.Your financial contribution towards =
getting medical supplies and food {which are the most important needs} =
now is highly solicited. We alongside over 30 emergency relief agencies =
irrespective of race or religion are working in conjunction with the =
W.H.O to avert an epidemic of cholera and other water borne =
diseases.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Presently, over 5 million people in South Asia are without food or =
water. The UN health agency requires over 68million pounds to forestall =
an outbreak of disease in a couple of days, which could be an even =
bigger disaster.<BR>
Please send your Contributions/Donations no matter how small, via =
WESTERN UNION MONEY TRANSFER And For sums exceeding 3,560 pounds, please =
mail back urgently for account information via:finals01@netscape.net<BR>
Please note that nothing is too small or too big to donate towards this =
cause.Please consider this humanitarian plea as urgent and treat as =
such. Expecting your favorable reply at your earliest convenience.<BR>
<BR>
Yours truly,<BR>
