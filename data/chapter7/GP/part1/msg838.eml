<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Mining Research News has achieved record results for =
our hot<BR>
mining picks as Gold has jumped to its highest levels for the<BR>
year.<BR>
<BR>
PriceWaterhouseCoopers analysts confirm worldwide mining<BR>
boom!Record mining profits and industry-wide merger mania<BR>
positions UDVE with huge reserves and expanded production<BR>
to jump 800%.<BR>
<BR>
Our precious metals and mining HOT-PICKS for the last 12<BR>
months have gained an average of 630%...we are expecting<BR>
earth-shattering news that will send shockwaves through<BR>
our latest pick UDVE.<BR>
<BR>
United Development International (UDVE.PK)<BR>
Current Price: .05<BR>
Short Term Explosion: URGENT-BUY up to .25 on a breakout<BR>
with a strong thrust expected to the .40 to .50 range.<BR>
<BR>
UDVE controls 3 of the largest gold mining properties in Guyana<BR>
(South America) including a 25-mile property with proven,<BR>
verified reserves exceeding 400,000 ounces of gold valued at<BR>
over $100,000,000.<BR>
<BR>
The Company is in a rapidly expanding state of gold production<BR>
while generating revenue and positive cash flow. UDVE has<BR>
literally struck gold with major funding news announced last<BR>
week that provides $13 MILLION for the purchase of additional<BR>
mining equipment enabling accelerated production and record<BR>
breaking profits.<BR>
<BR>
UDVE's breakout year is perfectly timed and will not go unnoticed<BR>
as PriceWaterhouseCoopers' head mining analyst, Paul Murphy,<BR>
stated just last month; &quot;We seem to be at the start of the =
first<BR>
mining boom of the twenty-first century.&quot; This statement<BR>
accompanied a PriceWaterhouse report detailing the record<BR>
doubling of profits for mining companies in 2003 with an even<BR>
brighter outlook for 2004.<BR>
<BR>
Hot gold issues are no longer taking a back seat while merger and<BR>
takeover activity is on the rise. Investors have scored major gains<BR>
on several recent highly-publicized battles for control of well-<BR>
positioned gold producers with similar structure to UDVE.<BR>
<BR>
REUTERS Newswire reported last quarter that mergers and<BR>
acquisitions in gold mining companies are being completed at a<BR>
record frantic pace with the expectation of this trend increasing.<BR>
Large-cap fund managers and securities analysts agree that the<BR>
junior mining group is especially more vulnerable to a buy-out or<BR>
takeover scenario in today's healthy mining environment. UDVE is<BR>
viewed as a serious takeover target based on their $140,000,000<BR>
revenue forecast, as the price for this undervalued asset play has<BR>
not even come close to reaching its true potential.<BR>
<BR>
Judging by the numbers, the value of UDVE's proven reserves<BR>
should push the share price to .25 immediately with greater upside<BR>
expected to match their fast-paced growth. UDVE has been heating<BR>
up the newswire with batches of positive developments regarding<BR>
production, reserve valuations, and additional property<BR>
acquisitions. Combine these activities with classic evidence of 60-<BR>
day accumulation and it's blatantly obvious that huge news is<BR>
about to be released that will have an explosive impact on<BR>
shareholder value.<BR>
