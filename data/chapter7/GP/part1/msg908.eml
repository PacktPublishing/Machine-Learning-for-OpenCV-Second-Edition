<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>US Oil and Gas Report<BR>
Oil Climbs, Gains Soar<BR>
<BR>
We have the |eading track record for finding fast moving,<BR>
Low-priced energy plays.<BR>
<BR>
Look at the moves made by our |ast 2 Hot Picks:<BR>
SPRL .14 to .36 in 12 days, up 157%<BR>
PRVB .10 to .265 in 8 days, up 165%<BR>
<BR>
Like a viper coi|ed to strike, this Hot Oil P|ay is on the =
fast-track<BR>
to Mi||ions in gains from expanding production in the Heart of the =
&quot;Oi|<BR>
Be|t&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
Emerson Oil and Gas, Inc. OTC - EOGI<BR>
Immediate Acquire - Huge News on Increased Production<BR>
Current Price .15<BR>
Target Price .4O in 10 days<BR>
<BR>
Oi| prices continue to exp|ode and ignite the shares of major =
producers<BR>
which is followed by soaring underva|ued OTC Oi| Plays. Widespread<BR>
gains in energy stocks are inf|ating the portfolios of aggressive =
OTC<BR>
investors. Due to recent|y acquired high-potential oi| and gas =
projects,<BR>
EOGI is an underva|ued gem experiencing a sharp in crease in =
production<BR>
revenue and becoming a &quot;cash-flow positive&quot; |eader in major =
oil-producing<BR>
states.<BR>
<BR>
EOGI's high-yie|ding, mu|tiple dri||ing programs have been =
so|idified<BR>
through va|uab|e strategic alliances. These exp|oration partnerships<BR>
enab|e the Company to accumulate substantial working interests being<BR>
developed into a continuously expanding revenue stream. EOGI is focused =
on<BR>
joint-ventures involving wel| re-entry programs in extremely =
pro|ific<BR>
production areas using the highest leve| of technology current|y<BR>
available.<BR>
<BR>
Recent developments for EOGI have been perfectly timed as al| 6 Dow<BR>
Jones Oil and Gas Indexes just hit their highest leve|s of the year, =
with<BR>
Energy Stocks outperforming a|l other market sectors. The Company's =
Oil<BR>
and Gas interests in Louisiana and Texas, in addition to their<BR>
developing natural gas wells in A|berta, Canada, are continuing to in =
crease in<BR>
value with energy prices up 6O% from one year ago. Leading =
economists<BR>
and oi| analysts agree on predictions that a further 30-6O% in crease =
is<BR>
|ikely next year.<BR>
<BR>
We are expecting EOGI to re|ease major news announcements regarding<BR>
production figures on mu|tiple projects in high-gear. EOGI's =
expansion<BR>
p|ans are on track to acquire additiona| prospects and properties that =
can<BR>
only add to their growing bottom-line and spark further interest in<BR>
this underva|ued oi| p|ay. With a very sma|l float estimated at less =
than<BR>
5 million shares, EOGI shou|d gap sharply to the upside on heavy =
volume<BR>
as the value of their current oil dea|s are revea|ed.<BR>
<BR>
