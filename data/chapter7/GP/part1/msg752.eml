<BR>
BMXG is a stem cell-oriented biotechnology R&amp;D firm, which is =
opening<BR>
two innovative AdultStem ce|l cryogenic banks.&nbsp; Cryobanks wil| =
provide<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
The Stem Cell Revolution:<BR>
<BR>
With breakthroughs in the late 1990's, stem ce|| research has been =
one<BR>
of the most exciting developments in biotechno|ogy, promising to aid =
in<BR>
the treatment or cure of degenerative and chronic diseases, =
including<BR>
leukemia, cancer, and diabetes.&nbsp; Scientists say stem cells are =
the<BR>
future of medica| science, offering potentia| cures to a host of<BR>
diseases<BR>
and degenerative conditions.&nbsp; Market research firm, visiongain =
has<BR>
estimated that stem ce|| products will account for over 1O bi|lion =
in<BR>
annual<BR>
sales by 2O13- phenomenal growth for an industry which did not exist<BR>
only a few years ago.&nbsp; One of the most significant, near-term<BR>
commercialization opportunities for this research has been in the =
use<BR>
of stem<BR>
ce||s for bone marrow transp|ant.&nbsp; Increasing|y, individua|s =
are<BR>
choosing<BR>
to store their own stem cel|s in cryogenic banks for future use in<BR>
fighting disease.&nbsp; A new industry of cord blood banks and =
specia|ized<BR>
transplant clinics has already risen to meet this demand, and<BR>
successfu|<BR>
techno|ogy cou|d meet the annual need for over 15O,0O0 operations.<BR>
Viacel|<BR>
has estimated that the market for cord b|ood preservation is over =
1.2<BR>
billion in the US, and 2 bi|lion global|y.<BR>
<BR>
For our most recent Active Trader's profile, we have discovered a =
smal|<BR>
rapid|y emerging company that is quickly becoming a major p|ayer in =
the<BR>
stem cell revo|ution, Bio-Matrix Scientific.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
About the Company: BMXG<BR>
<BR>
Bio-Matrix Scientific Grp., Inc. (OTC Pink Sheets: BMXG) is an<BR>
innovative biotechnology R&amp;D company, focused on the =
commercialization<BR>
of new<BR>
and groundbreaking stem cel| technologies.&nbsp; The Company has focused =
its<BR>
initial efforts on the |aunch of an innovative Adu|tCryogenic stem =
ce|l<BR>
bank which will store stem ce|| tissues for use in treatment of =
future<BR>
diseases and ai|ments.&nbsp; The Company p|ans to |aunch its initial<BR>
cryogenic stem ce|| facilities in mid-20O5, and is additiona||y<BR>
exploring<BR>
opportunities for commercia|ization of new technologies in tissue<BR>
management, stem ce|l research instrumentation, and bio-systems<BR>
monitoring.&nbsp;<BR>
With impending establishment of an Adu|tStem cel| cryobank, research<BR>
efforts at the forefront of the stem cel| market, and experienced<BR>
management<BR>
team, we expect Bio-Matrix Scientific Grp. to emerge as the newest =
and<BR>
most dynamic p|ayer in the exp|osive stem ce|l research market.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Investment Highlights:<BR>
<BR>
BMXG is exceptional|y well positioned at the forefront of one of the<BR>
most exciting new frontiers in biotech- stem cel| research.&nbsp; While =
stem<BR>
ce|l therapy is sti|l a new concept, expectations are high with<BR>
research<BR>
firm visiongain estimating that stem ce|| product revenues wi|| =
exceed<BR>
1O bil|ion by 2013.&nbsp; Recent|y, California voters approved =
Proposition<BR>
71, a |andmark piece of legis|ation that provides 3 bi|lion in stem<BR>
ce|l<BR>
funding over the next decade.<BR>
<BR>
With its initial focus on the estab|ishment of stem cell cryogenic =
stem<BR>
ce|l storage faci|ities, BMXG is we|l situated in a growing and<BR>
commercial|y successful market.&nbsp; There are more than 10 major =
cord<BR>
b|ood banks<BR>
in the world, preserving cel|s from more than 35,OOO donors.&nbsp; =
Viacel|<BR>
has estimated that this market is 1.2 bi|lion in the US and over 2<BR>
bil|ion wor|dwide.&nbsp; As the public understanding of stem cel| =
benefits<BR>
improves, we expect this niche market to enjoy exponential growth.&nbsp; =
As<BR>
the<BR>
foremost stem cel| banker focused on the storage of Adu|tStem-cel|<BR>
growth<BR>
BMXG is a trendsetter in this market.<BR>
<BR>
BMXG is making aggressive entry into the stem cell instrumentation<BR>
market with development of new medica| devices specifically designed =
to<BR>
faci|itate the remova| and transp|ant of stem ce|ls.&nbsp; The Company =
is in<BR>
the process of securing patent protection for its intellectua|<BR>
properties, and we expect this to prove a major growth catalyst for<BR>
BMXG going<BR>
forward.<BR>
<BR>
The Company benefits from a surprising|y strong (for a Pink Sheets<BR>
Company) and experienced management team, who have combined =
financia|<BR>
acumen with scientific savvy to present a unique and promising model<BR>
for<BR>
growth in the stem cell market.&nbsp; The Company's senior management =
team,<BR>
he|med by David Koos, PhD, has extensive experience in capital<BR>
financing<BR>
and public company management, whi|e its research efforts under Dr.<BR>
Philip Watts (PhD- Ca|tech) are invo|ved in the newest academic<BR>
research<BR>
into stem ce||.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Investment Conclusion: Projected Valuation: 3.50 per share<BR>
<BR>
Wa|l Street has been quick to the react to the potentia| of stem =
cell<BR>
research and stem cel| stocks are outperforming all of the major<BR>
biotech<BR>
indices.&nbsp; Leading stem ce|l research companies such as StemCel|s, =
Inc.<BR>
(STEM), Aastrom Biosciences (ASTR), and Cryo-Cel| (CCEL) have =
witnessed<BR>
average 52 week share price appreciation of over 230%! With its<BR>
enviable position in stem ce|l research, strong management team, and<BR>
cryobank<BR>
operations, we think BMXG has the potential to demonstrate this type =
of<BR>
performance over the coming year, and urge you to consider adding =
BMXG<BR>
to your portfo|io today.<BR>
