Fatality was not significantly different  Failures were significantly =
more
common with combination therapy  Among all trials we found no evidence =
for
any potential prevention of infection by resistant isolates with =
combination
therapy  <BR>
It can be debated which design appropriately examines the clinical
interpretation of synergism studies comparing same or different  lactams =

Synergism has been defined as a 2 log10 or greater reduction in =
bacterial
count with the combination versus that with each of the agents alone 86 =
In
studies comparing the same  lactam this is directly tested but the =
effect of
increasing the antibiotic spectrum cannot be separated from a =
synergistic
effect  <BR>

But I must wait--I must wait--I must wait! I'm glad you've come to your
senses, remarked Rob, drily
