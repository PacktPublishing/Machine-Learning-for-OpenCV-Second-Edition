<P><FONT SIZE=2>DEAR FRIEND,<BR>
I AM MRS. SESE-SEKO WIDOW OF LATE PRESIDENT MOBUTU<BR>
SESE-SEKO OF ZAIRE? NOW KNOWN AS DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC<BR>
OF CONGO (DRC). I AM MOVED TO WRITE YOU THIS LETTER,<BR>
THIS WAS IN CONFIDENCE CONSIDERING MY PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCE<BR>
AND SITUATION. I ESCAPED ALONG WITH MY HUSBAND AND TWO OF<BR>
OUR SONS KENNEDY AND BASHER OUT OF DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF<BR>
CONGO (DRC) TO ABIDJAN, COTE DIVOIRE WHERE MY FAMILY<BR>
AND I SETTLED, WHILE WE LATER MOVED TO SETTLED IN MORROCO<BR>
WHERE MY HUSBAND LATER DIED OF CANCER DISEASE. HOWEVER DUE<BR>
TO THIS SITUATION WE DECIDED TO CHANGED MOST OF MY<BR>
HUSBAND'S BILLIONS OF DOLLARS DEPOSITED IN SWISS BANK AND<BR>
OTHER COUNTRIES INTO OTHER FORMS OF MONEY CODED FOR SAFE<BR>
PURPOSE BECAUSE THE NEW HEAD OF STATE OF (DR) MR LAURENT<BR>
&nbsp;KABILA HAS MADE ARRANGEMENT WITH THE SWISS GOVERNMENT AND<BR>
OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO FREEZE ALL MY LATE HUSBAND'S<BR>
TREASURES DEPOSITED IN SOME EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. HENCE MY<BR>
CHILDREN AND I DECIDED LAYING LOW IN AFRICA TO STUDY THE<BR>
SITUATION TILL WHEN THINGS GETS BETTER, LIKE NOW THAT<BR>
PRESIDENT KABILA IS DEAD AND THE SON TAKING OVER (JOSEPH<BR>
KABILA). ONE OF MY LATE HUSBAND'S CHATEAUX IN SOUTHERN<BR>
FRANCE WAS CONFISCATED BY THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT, AND AS<BR>
SUCH I HAD TO CHANGE MY IDENTITY SO THAT MY INVESTMENT<BR>
WILL NOT BE TRACED AND CONFISCATED. I HAVE DEPOSITED THE<BR>
SUM OF EIHGTEEN MLLION UNITED STATE<BR>
DOLLARS(US$18,000,000,00.) WITH A SECURITY COMPANY , FOR<BR>
SAFEKEEPING. THE FUNDS ARE SECURITY CODED TO PREVENT THEM<BR>
FROM KNOWING THE CONTENT. WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS TO<BR>
INDICATE YOUR INTEREST THAT YOU WILL ASSIST US BY RECEIVING<BR>
THE MONEY ON OUR BEHALF.ACKNOWLEDGE THIS MESSAGE, SO THAT I<BR>
CAN INTRODUCE YOU TO MY SON (KENNEDY) WHO HAS THE OUT<BR>
MODALITIES FOR THE CLAIM OF THE SAID FUNDS. I WANT YOU TO<BR>
ASSIST IN INVESTING THIS MONEY, BUT I WILL NOT WANT MY<BR>
IDENTITY REVEALED. I WILL ALSO WANT TO BUY PROPERTIES AND<BR>
STOCK IN MULTI-NATIONAL COMPANIES AND TO ENGAGE IN OTHER<BR>
SAFE AND<BR>
NON-SPECULATIVEINVESTMENTS. MAY I AT THIS POINT EMPHASISE<BR>
THE HIGH LEVEL OF CONFIDENTIALITY,WHICH THIS BUSINESS<BR>
DEMANDS, AND HOPE YOU WILL NOT BETRAY THE TRUST AND<BR>
CONFIDENCE, WHICH I REPOSE IN YOU.<BR>
&nbsp;IN CONCLUSION, IF YOU WANT TO ASSIST US , MY SON SHALL<BR>
PUT YOU IN THE PICTURE OF THE BUSINESS, TELL YOU WHERE THE<BR>
FUNDS ARE CURRENTLY BEING MAINTAINED AND ALSO DISCUSS<BR>
OTHER MODALITIES INCLUDING REMUNERATION FOR YOUR SERVICES.<BR>
FOR THIS REASON KINDLY FURNISH US YOUR CONTACT<BR>

NUMBER FOR CONFIDENTIAL PURPOSE AND ACKNOWLEDGE RECEIPT OF<BR>
THIS MAIL.<BR>
