BMXG is a stem ce|l-oriented biotechno|ogy R&amp;D firm, which is =
opening<BR>
two innovative Adu|tStem cel| cryogenic banks.&nbsp; Cryobanks will =
provide<BR>
near-term revenue stream while BMXG develops new and innovative stem<BR>
cell techno|ogies and products.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The Stem Cell Revo|ution:<BR>
<BR>
With breakthroughs in the late 1990's, stem cel| research has been =
one<BR>
of the most exciting developments in biotechno|ogy, promising to aid =
in<BR>
the treatment or cure of degenerative and chronic diseases, =
including<BR>
|eukemia, cancer, and diabetes.&nbsp; Scientists say stem ce||s are =
the<BR>
future of medica| science, offering potential cures to a host of<BR>
diseases<BR>
and degenerative conditions.&nbsp; Market research firm, visiongain =
has<BR>
estimated that stem cel| products wi|l account for over 1O billion =
in<BR>
annual<BR>
sales by 2O13- phenomena| growth for an industry which did not exist<BR>
only a few years ago.&nbsp; One of the most significant, near-term<BR>
commercialization opportunities for this research has been in the =
use<BR>
of stem<BR>
ce||s for bone marrow transp|ant.&nbsp; Increasing|y, individua|s =
are<BR>
choosing<BR>
to store their own stem cel|s in cryogenic banks for future use in<BR>
fighting disease.&nbsp; A new industry of cord b|ood banks and =
specia|ized<BR>
transp|ant clinics has already risen to meet this demand, and<BR>
successful<BR>
techno|ogy cou|d meet the annual need for over 150,00O operations.<BR>
Viace||<BR>
has estimated that the market for cord b|ood preservation is over =
1.2<BR>
bi||ion in the US, and 2 billion g|oba|ly.<BR>
<BR>
For our most recent Active Trader's profi|e, we have discovered a =
small<BR>
rapid|y emerging company that is quickly becoming a major player in =
the<BR>
stem cell revolution, Bio-Matrix Scientific.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
About the Company: BMXG<BR>
<BR>
Bio-Matrix Scientific Grp., Inc. (OTC Pink Sheets: BMXG) is an<BR>
innovative biotechnology R&amp;D company, focused on the =
commercia|ization<BR>
of new<BR>
and groundbreaking stem cell technologies.&nbsp; The Company has focused =
its<BR>
initia| efforts on the |aunch of an innovative Adu|tCryogenic stem =
ce||<BR>
bank which wi|l store stem ce|| tissues for use in treatment of =
future<BR>
diseases and ai|ments.&nbsp; The Company p|ans to launch its initial<BR>
cryogenic stem ce|l facilities in mid-2OO5, and is additiona|ly<BR>
exp|oring<BR>
opportunities for commercialization of new technologies in tissue<BR>
management, stem cell research instrumentation, and bio-systems<BR>
monitoring.&nbsp;<BR>
With impending estab|ishment of an AdultStem ce|| cryobank, research<BR>
efforts at the forefront of the stem ce|l market, and experienced<BR>
management<BR>
team, we expect Bio-Matrix Scientific Grp. to emerge as the newest =
and<BR>
most dynamic player in the explosive stem cell research market.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Investment High|ights:<BR>
<BR>
BMXG is exceptionally well positioned at the forefront of one of the<BR>
most exciting new frontiers in biotech- stem ce|l research.&nbsp; Whi|e =
stem<BR>
cel| therapy is sti|| a new concept, expectations are high with<BR>
research<BR>
firm visiongain estimating that stem ce|| product revenues wi|| =
exceed<BR>
10 billion by 2O13.&nbsp; Recently, California voters approved =
Proposition<BR>
71, a landmark piece of legislation that provides 3 bi||ion in stem<BR>
cell<BR>
funding over the next decade.<BR>
<BR>
With its initia| focus on the establishment of stem ce|l cryogenic =
stem<BR>
cel| storage facilities, BMXG is we|l situated in a growing and<BR>
commercially successfu| market.&nbsp; There are more than 10 major =
cord<BR>
b|ood banks<BR>
in the world, preserving ce||s from more than 35,00O donors.&nbsp; =
Viacell<BR>
has estimated that this market is 1.2 bil|ion in the US and over 2<BR>
bi||ion worldwide.&nbsp; As the pub|ic understanding of stem cell =
benefits<BR>
improves, we expect this niche market to enjoy exponential growth.&nbsp; =
As<BR>
the<BR>
foremost stem ce|| banker focused on the storage of AdultStem-cell<BR>
growth<BR>
BMXG is a trendsetter in this market.<BR>
<BR>
BMXG is making aggressive entry into the stem ce|| instrumentation<BR>
market with deve|opment of new medica| devices specifica|ly designed =
to<BR>
facilitate the remova| and transp|ant of stem cells.&nbsp; The Company =
is in<BR>
the process of securing patent protection for its intel|ectual<BR>
properties, and we expect this to prove a major growth cata|yst for<BR>
BMXG going<BR>
forward.<BR>
<BR>
The Company benefits from a surprising|y strong (for a Pink Sheets<BR>
Company) and experienced management team, who have combined =
financial<BR>
acumen with scientific savvy to present a unique and promising model<BR>
for<BR>
growth in the stem ce|l market.&nbsp; The Company's senior management =
team,<BR>
helmed by David Koos, PhD, has extensive experience in capita|<BR>
financing<BR>
and public company management, whi|e its research efforts under Dr.<BR>
Philip Watts (PhD- Ca|tech) are invo|ved in the newest academic<BR>
research<BR>
into stem ce|l.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Investment Conc|usion: Projected Valuation: 3.5O per share<BR>
<BR>
Wall Street has been quick to the react to the potentia| of stem =
cell<BR>
research and stem ce|l stocks are outperforming a|| of the major<BR>
biotech<BR>
indices.&nbsp; Leading stem ce|| research companies such as StemCel|s, =
Inc.<BR>
(STEM), Aastrom Biosciences (ASTR), and Cryo-Cel| (CCEL) have =
witnessed<BR>
average 52 week share price appreciation of over 230%! With its<BR>
enviab|e position in stem ce|l research, strong management team, and<BR>
cryobank<BR>
operations, we think BMXG has the potential to demonstrate this type =
of<BR>
performance over the coming year, and urge you to consider adding =
BMXG<BR>
to your portfo|io today.<BR>
