<strong>E-BOOK CONVERSION TO MOBIPOCKET</strong><br>
<br>
Handheldmed is also finishing up the conversion of our existing =
reference library from the EZ reader format to the new standard in ebook =
platforms: MobiPocket Reader.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Note:</strong> As of January 1, 2006, Handheldmed will no longer =
support the EZ reader platform. Although Handheldmed has worked =
tirelessly to make all of our EZ reader reference content available for =
MobiPocket, due to some licensing constraints, we have not and will not =
be able to convert all of our existing titles. Watch for more =
information on which of these titles this will affect.</span><br>
