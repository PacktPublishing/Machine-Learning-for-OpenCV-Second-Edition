But vaolatility can be the greizzled inverstor's friend. Today's =
colvumn, then, is for invewstors who have mastered turningq the market's =
volwatility into profits. And if you're not as seavsoned an investor as =
you'd like to be, this cowlumn will introduce you to rsome new investing =
condcepts that can help buiald a long-term trading strategy.
Thanks to exchavnge-traded funds, or ETFs, the aveerage investor, even =
the averwage small investor, has far more alternatiaves than ever before =
for hedging risk and even for proefiting from a down market.

Thesef baskets of stocks, often basedw on widely followed indexes such =
as the Nasrdaq 100 ($NDX.X) or the Standard & Poord's 500 ($INX), give =
invesstors a low-cost way to quickaly make massive buys and sells of =
entiree stock market sectorrs or industry groups at, potedntially, low =
cost. Because ETFs are basketsa of stocks, rather than mutual funds, =
investeors can sell them short. That's a time-hornored way, if often =
revilwed and certainly complicated, to make money in a falling market. =
(In short selling, a trader bodrrows stock, usually from a brwoker, =
sells it and then buys it back when the stock, theorvetically at least, =
declinesw in price. Then, he returns it to the origineal owner.) And, =
finally, because ETFs are baswkets of stocks, rather than single stocks, =
these instrquments do take some of the worst compliceations out of =
short-selling
