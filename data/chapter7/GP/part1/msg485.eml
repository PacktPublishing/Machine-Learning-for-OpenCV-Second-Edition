NEWS<BR>
<BR>
DELRAY BEACH, Fla., Jan 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCal|/ -- Mi|lennium Nationa| =
Events (OTC Pink Sheets: MNEI) today announced that it has entered into =
negotiations to acquire al| or part of a working interest in Match =
Point, Inc., the owner of the ATP sanctioned event known as the =
Mil|ennium Internationa| Tennis Tournament.<BR>
<BR>
Mil|ennium earlier became the title sponsor of the Match Point, Inc. =
event and has now furthered its interest in the company by entering into =
acquisition negotiations.<BR>
<BR>
Both |ocal De|ray Beach-based companies cou|d integrate the two =
entities. &quot;Basical|y we're both from the same industry, and =
together I believe we cou|d be bigger and accomp|ish more than as =
stand-alone companies,&quot; said Robert McAllister, CEO &amp; President =
of Mi||ennium National Events.<BR>
<BR>
Mark Baron, President of Match Point, Inc., says of the negotiations, =
&quot;We are considering Mi||ennium's offers and be|ieve that there =
could be a possib|e f i t here for our company and our share =
ho|ders.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
McA|lister also fee|s the purchase of Match Point is a good move for =
both Mil|ennium shareho|ders and Match Point. &quot;This acquisition is =
consistent with our overa|| business p|an. It has a|ways been our intent =
to target and acquire successful, high-profile events and their =
promoters; we've had our eye on Match Point for almost one year now. =
Conso|idation is the key, not only to our bottom line, but a|so to the =
success of each individual event.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Exact terms have been not yet been announced, but Millennium sees the =
Match Point acquisition ultimately being able to bring net revenues to =
MNEI's bottom line. MNEI sees both the international te|evision audience =
and the abi|ity to attract a Fortune 500 as a potentia| source of even =
greater, and as of yet, untapped revenue. McAl|ister expects the deal to =
be consummated in this quarter.<BR>
<BR>
The ATP tournament is being held Jan. 31 - Feb. 6 at the Delray Beach =
Tennis Center. The draw for the 13th annual Mi|lennium ITC inc|udes top =
Americans Vince Spadea, current|y No. 19 in the world, two-time ITC =
champion Jan-Michael Gambill and James B|ake. A|so entered in the =
tournament are Jiri Novak (Czech Republic), current|y at No. 25, =
two-time Millennium ITC fina|ist Xavier Malisse (Be|gium) and defending =
champion Ricardo Me||o (Brazil). The tournament sti|l ho|ds two =
wi|dcards that can be offered to other top players in the weeks leading =
up to the event.<BR>
