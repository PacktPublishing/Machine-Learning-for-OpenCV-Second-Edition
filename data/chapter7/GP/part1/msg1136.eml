<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Dear Beloved,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
My name is Obi Philips, I am for the most part a legal consultant of =
an<BR>
European owned private bank with over $10 Billion under Management.<BR>
<BR>
I am writing regarding the contents of a certain numbered account =
whose<BR>
holder passed away under tragic circumstances.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Since the demise of the account holder. My firm has been contacted<BR>
regarding establishing the legitimacy or otherwise of any claim that =
may<BR>
arise in furtherance of the administration of the late account =
holders<BR>
estate.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately the account holder died intestate and efforts to locate =
a<BR>
legitimate successor have proved abortive so far. The statutory =
period<BR>
for establishing a claim has all but lapsed . At the expiration of =
this<BR>
period we will have to submit a report to the bank and the estate of<BR>
the demised account holder will statutorily revert to the State on<BR>
disclosure.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I do not want to bore you with legal jargon but I need to mention =
that<BR>
the country in question respects the laws of intestate succession =
which<BR>
would mean that without a valid will the estate will revert to a<BR>
surviving relative of the deceased anywhere in the world as long as =
lineage<BR>
can be established .<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
We ( my colleagues and I) will be willing to compensate you =
handsomely<BR>
for you to present yourself as the next of kin of the demised =
account<BR>
holder. We would make the necessary representation and documentation<BR>
available for you to establish this claim without incident but we all =
have<BR>
to be prepared to go the legal distance.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Specifically we would be willing to compensate you with 20% of a<BR>
perceived inheritance exceeding $26million. I would not be able to =
disclose<BR>
any further information regarding this transaction till you indicate<BR>
serious intent .<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I can be contacted via this medium :<BR>
obiphilips@web-mail.com.ar or my private fax +234-1-7591074 and I =
will<BR>
furnish you preliminary details to assuage your misgivings (if any)<BR>
presently. I will give you my contact Telephone numbers in Nigeria =
if<BR>
further discussions are necessary following initial contact. I =
respectfully<BR>
dismiss myself sine die.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Thank you for your patience.<BR>
