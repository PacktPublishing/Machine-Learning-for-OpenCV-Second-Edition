Inf0rmation within this em-ail contains &quot;f0rward l00king =
sta-tements&quot; within<BR>
the meaning of Secti0n 27A of the Se-curities Act of 1933 and Secti0n =
21B of<BR>
the Se-curities Exc-hange Act of 1934. Any st-atements that express or =
inv0lve<BR>
discussi0ns with respect to predicti0ns, expectati0ns, be.liefs, =
plans,<BR>
projecti0ns, 0bjectives, g0als, assumpti0ns or fu'ture events or =
perf0rmance<BR>
are not stat-ements of hist0rical fact and may be &quot;f0rward =
l00king<BR>
sta-tements.&quot;F0rward l00king sta-tements are based on expectati0ns, =
est-imates<BR>
and projecti0ns at the time the sta-tements are made that inv0lve a =
number of<BR>
ri'sks and uncer'tainties which could cause actual re-sults or events to =
differ<BR>
mat-erially from those presently ant-icipated. F0rward l00king =
sta-tements in<BR>
this acti0n may be iden-tified through the use of words such as =
&quot;pr0jects&quot;,<BR>
&quot;f0resee&quot;, &quot;ex-pects&quot;, &quot;will,&quot; =
&quot;an-ticipates,&quot; &quot;est'imates,&quot; =
&quot;bel-ieves,&quot;<BR>
&quot;un-derstands&quot; or that by st-atements indi-cating certain =
acti0ns &quot;may,&quot;<BR>
&quot;c0uld,&quot; or &quot;might&quot; 0ccur. As with many micr0cap =
st0cks, t0day's c0mpany has<BR>
additi0nal ri-sk fact0rs w0rth n0ting.The c0mpany has a g0ing c0ncern =
0pinion<BR>
from its audit0r, has relied on l0ans from 0fficers and an =
af'filiate<BR>
shareh0lder to pay exp-enses, has a large acc-umulated def'icit since =
its<BR>
incepti0n and is inv0lved in li-tigation in the n0rmal c0urse of its<BR>
bus'iness, none of which is ant-icipated to have a ma-terial adve-rse =
ef-fect on<BR>
its fi-nancial c0nditi0n, 0perati0ns or pr0spects. The C0mpany will need =
to<BR>
0btain fin'ancing. There can be no assu-rance of that happening. On June =
7,<BR>
2004, Nathaniel Energy C0rporati0n issued a press rele'ase that its =
helium<BR>
and gas pr0cessing facility in Keyes, Oklahoma exp-erienced a fire, =
that<BR>
there were no injuries, and that repairs are underway. The Gr0wth =
St0ck<BR>
Rep0rt does not rep-resent that the inf0rmation c0ntained in this =
mes-sage<BR>
states all mat'erial facts or does not 0mit a mate'rial fact nec-essary =
to make<BR>
the sta-tements therein not misl-eading.All inf0rmati0n pr0vided within =
this<BR>
ema-il per-taining to in-vesting, st0cks, se-curities must be underst00d =
as<BR>
inf0rmation pr0vided and not inves-tment advi-ce. The Gr0wth St0ck =
Rep0rt<BR>
advi-ses all rea'ders and sub'scri'bers to seek advi-ce from a =
reg-is'tered<BR>
pr0fessi0nal se-curities represe'ntative before deciding to tr'ade in =
st0cks<BR>
fea-tured within this ema-il. None of the mat-erial within this rep0rt =
shall be<BR>
c0nstrued as any kind of inves-tment a-dvice or s0licitati0n. Many of =
these<BR>
c0mpanies are on the verge of bankr'uptcy. You can l0se all your m0ney =
by<BR>
inv-est-ing in this st0ck. The publ-isher of The Gr0wth St0ck =
Rep0rt&nbsp; is not a<BR>
re-gistered in-vest-ment expert. Subs-cri-bers should not view =
informati0n<BR>
herein as legal, tax, acc0unting or in'ves-tment advi'ce. Any ref'erence =
to past<BR>
perf0rmance(s) of c0mpanies are spe-cially sele-cted to be refe'ren'ced =
based on<BR>
the fav0rable perf0rmance of these c0mpanies. You would need perfect =
timing<BR>
to achie-ve the res'ults in the exa'mples given. There can be no =
assu-rance of<BR>
that happening. Remember, as always, past perf0rmance is nev-er =
in-dica'tive<BR>
of fu-ture results and a th0rough due dil-igence eff0rt should be =
c0mpleted pri0r<BR>
to inv-esting.&nbsp; Past perf0rmance is nev-er ind-icative of fu'ture =
re-sults.<BR>
In c0mpliance with the Secu-rities Act of 1933, Secti0n17(b), The Gr0wth =
St0ck<BR>
Rep0rt&nbsp; discl0ses the re-ceipt of eight th0usand d0llars from a =
third pa-rty,<BR>
not an 0fficer, direct0r or af-filiate shareh0lder of the c0mpany for =
the<BR>
circulati0n of this rep0rt. Be aware of an inherent c0nflict of =
int'erest<BR>
res-ulting from such c0mpensation due to the fact that this is a =
pa'id<BR>
adver-tis'ement. All fac'tual inf0rmation in this rep0rt was gathered =
from public<BR>
s0urces, including but not lim-ited to C0mpany We-bsites, SEC filings =
and C0mpany<BR>
Pre-ss Rel-eases. The Gr0wth St0ck Rep0rt&nbsp; bel-ieves this =
inf0rmation to be<BR>
rel-iable but can make no guaran-tee as to its a-ccu-racy or =
c0mpleteness.<BR>
Use of the ma-terial within this e-mail c0nstitutes your acc-eptance of =
these terms.<BR>
