<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>As you may already know, we specialized in assisting =
businesses in becoming publicly traded. We also assist with Private =
Placement preparation and public company filings. The President of our =
company is a very experienced securities and corporate law attorney.<BR>
<BR>
Many people are not aware that any company can go public including a =
start up or development stage company.&nbsp; Please visit our site or =
email us to receive our Go Public Report and our Advantages of Going =
Public Report.<BR>
<BR>
We would like to propose a joint venture with you. If you or a associate =
of yours are interested in taking a company public, please let us know. =
We are happy, for you to be very generously compensated for any =
referral.<BR>
<BR>
I wish I could convey to you, all the many benefits of going public in a =
brief letter.&nbsp; I am not sure if you can imagine how valuable and =
powerful a public company can be in achieving your goals and =
objectives.<BR>
<BR>
Since we provide such an outstanding service and have a great deal of =
experience, you may want to pass this email on to an associate or you =
can send us their information.<BR>
<BR>
We look forward to hearing from you soon.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Sincerely,<BR>
<BR>
