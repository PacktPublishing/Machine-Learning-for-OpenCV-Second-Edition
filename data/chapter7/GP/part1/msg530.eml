<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Greetings and Compliments.<BR>
<BR>
I strongly regret any inconvenience the receipt of this letter may<BR>
cause you, bearing in mind the nature of its content coming from a =
person<BR>
without any referral, but please read and assimilate its content and =
objectively<BR>
consider if we can work together.<BR>
<BR>
I am the head of the account department of a Private Bank in<BR>
Netherlands and I would like to intimate you with certain facts that I =
believe<BR>
wouldbe of interest to you.<BR>
<BR>
This involves a client who shared the same last name with you and =
had<BR>
an investment placed under our bank's management years ago, the<BR>
circumstances surrounding the investment made by this client who died =
interstate,<BR>
with no known nominated successor in title over this investment made =
with the<BR>
Private Banking Branch of my bank has made it very difficult to locate =
anyone<BR>
who is directly related to the deceased.<BR>
<BR>
With the very strong feeling that no one will ever come forward to<BR>
claim the funds and the investigation coming to a close after several =
months, the<BR>
need for an assistance becomes crucial, as a next of kin to the =
depositor is<BR>
earnestly being searched for, I have already developed a foolproof, =
legal and<BR>
totally risk free means through which the fund can be released to =
your<BR>
nominated bank account within a very short time after due documentation =
and<BR>
authentication process.<BR>
<BR>
The strategy is to use my position and influence as the Head of the<BR>
branch and Personal Account office of the deceased to present you as a =
next of<BR>
Kin and beneficiary of the deposit. I want to assure you that I have =
concluded<BR>
all local modalities for the successful completion of this within 10<BR>
banking days of your agreement to proceed with me as the required =
assistance is<BR>
perfected to be 100% risk free.<BR>
<BR>
I expect your urgent response and if in the affirmative, I shall<BR>
advice you on what we need to do. barry_douglas@mycity.com OR =
barrydouglas09@yahoo.com.au<BR>
<BR>
Best Regards,<BR>
<BR>
Barry Douglas.<BR>
