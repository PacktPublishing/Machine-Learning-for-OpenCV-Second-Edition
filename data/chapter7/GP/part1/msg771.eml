Dear Sir,<BR>
REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE IN A FINANCIAL TRANSACTION<BR>
I am interested in your partnership in business dealing. This business =
proposal I<BR>
wish to intimate you with is of mutual benefit and its success is =
entirely based on<BR>
mutual trust, cooperation and a high level of confidentiality as regard =
this<BR>
transaction.<BR>
I am the Chairman of the Contract Advisory Committee(CAC) of the =
Nigerian Federal<BR>
Ministry of Works and Housing (FMWH). I am seeking your assistance to =
enable me<BR>
transfer the sum of US$16,500,000.00 (Sixteen Million, Five Hundred =
Thousand United<BR>
States Dollars)into your private/company account.The fund came about as =
a result of a<BR>
contract awarded and executed on behalf of my Ministry the Federal =
Ministry of Works<BR>
and Housing. The contract was supposed to be awarded to two foreign =
contractors to<BR>
the tune of US$60,000,000.00 (Sixty Million United States Dollars). But =
in the course<BR>
of negotiation, the contract was awarded to a Bulgarian contractor at =
the cost of<BR>
US$43,500,000.00 (Forty-Three Million,Five Hundred Thousand United =
States Dollars) to<BR>
my benefit unknown to the contractor.<BR>
This contract has been satisfactorily executed and inspected as the =
Bulgarian firm is<BR>
presently securing payment from my Ministry, where I am the Executive =
Director in-<BR>
charge of all foreign contract payment approval. As a civil servant =
still in active<BR>
government service, I am forbidden by law to operate an account outside =
the shores of<BR>

enable me present<BR>
your private/company account details as a beneficiary<BR>
of contractual claims alongside that of the Bulgarian contractor, to =
enable me<BR>
transfer the difference of US$16,500,000.00 (Sixteen Million, Five =
Hundred Thousand<BR>
United States Dollars) into your providedaccount.<BR>
On actualisation, the fund will be disbursed as stated below:<BR>
&nbsp; 1. 20% of the fund will be for you as beneficiary<BR>
&nbsp; 2. 10% for reimbursement to both parties for incidental expenses =
that may be<BR>
incurred during the course of the transaction.<BR>
&nbsp; 3. 70% of the fund will be for me which I intend to invest in =
Real Estate business<BR>
your country with you as my partner. All logistics are in place and all =
modalities<BR>
worked out for a smooth actualisation of the transaction within the next =
few working<BR>
days of commencement.You can reach me through this e-mail address<BR>
