Nothing that you have not given away will ever be really yours.


I don't deserve this award, but I have arthritis, and I don't deserve =
that, either.<br><br>The most important thing a father can do for his =
children is to love their mother.



Tricks and treachery are the practice of fools, that don't have brains =
enough to be honest.



<br>A heart that loves is always young.



If you drink, don't drive. Don't even putt.

<BR><BR>Husbands never become good they merely become proficient.

<BR><BR>Only from the heart Can you touch the sky.

<BR><BR>Even if it is to be, what end do you serve by running to =
distress?<br><br>It is a terrible thing to look over your shoulder when =
you are trying to lead -- and find no one there.



<BR><BR>I hated her now with a hatred more fatal than indifference =
because it was the other side of love.



<BR>Reading makes a full man, meditation a profound man, discourse a =
clear man.

<BR>A few strong instincts and a few plain rules suffice us.
<BR>We are all sentenced to solitary confinement inside our own skins, =
for life.
<BR><BR>Eroticism is assenting to life even in death.



<br><br>Truly great friends are hard to find, difficult to leave, and =
impossible to forget.



<BR>The weeping of an heir is laughter in disguise.The harder I work the =
luckier I get.<br><br><A =
