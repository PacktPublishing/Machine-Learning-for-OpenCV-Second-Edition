IOTN from .74 to 3.65 in 8 days for a gain of 393%!<br>
MOBL from .09 to .29 in 6 days for a gain of 223%!
<p>Here is our next explosive stock pick:<br>
  Diversified Product Inspections, Inc. (OTC-BB: DPRI)<br>
  Buy at .33<br>
  Sell target .94 =3D Diamond Play!</p>
<p>Major Contract Announcements and<br>
  Huge Newsletter Coverage This Week for DPRI !</p>
<p>DPRI has been saving the largest insurance companies in the US =
$Millions <br>
  for over 14 years by performing defective product and fire =
investigations and=20
  <br>
  air quality analysis. The number of annual product inspections =
performed by=20
  <br>
  DPRI with regard to investigating defects has tripled to 10,000 per =
year up=20
  <br>
  from 3,000 three years ago as insurers see the financial rewards of =
<br>
  identifying the exact cause of a defective or failed product. </p>
<p>DPRI reported positive earnings of .04 cents per share in 2003 with =
.07 cents=20
  <br>
  per share expected for the current year. The stock should be trading =
<br>
  conservatively at over 1.50 on the strength of those figures.</p>
<p>DPRI's client base reads like a &quot;who's-who&quot; of the =
insurance industry=20
  <br>
  including Allstate, Fireman's Fund, Hartford, Liberty Mutual, =
Nationwide, <br>
  Prudential, Republic, State Farm and Travelers. DPRI has the largest =
and <br>
  most thorough database in the US for identifying product defects that =
are <br>
  responsible for hundreds of millions in damage. DPRI has little to no =
<br>
  competitors in this arena and just signed a contract for a single =
company to=20
  <br>
  pay them $1 Million for access to this database over a 10 year period. =
That's=20
  <br>
  just one company out of hundreds that can't afford to be without this =
<br>
  valuable information.</p>
<p>Billionaire-financial genius Warren Buffet has grown his Berkshire =
<br>
  Hathaway empire (trading at over $80,000 per share) on the explosive =
cash <br>
  flow from 3 insurance subsidiaries: National Indemnity, GEICO, and =
<br>
  reinsurance giant General Re. </p>
<p>DPRI is being force-fed ever increasing amounts of business by the =
leading=20
  <br>
  core of this very successful sector but has remained below the radar =
of <br>
  investors, thus creating a share price that is artificially =
undervalued. DPRI=20
  <br>
  has the proven experience that fosters escalating revenues and growth. =
Based=20
  <br>
  on the very small float and the ability for the stock to jump sharply =
on any=20
  <br>
  real volume, upcoming news and continuous profits will lead to =
increased <br>
  exposure in conjunction with a soaring stock price.</p>
<p>We are expecting significant upcoming news regarding increased =
revenues <br>
  and contract expansion from DPRI's Fortune 500 customer base. Look for =
<br>
  record volume and price appreciation as DPRI may very well be one of =
the <br>
  most undervalued stocks on the OTCBB!</p>
<p>Required DPRI information: OTCBB Stock Alert is an independent <br>
  newsletter with the goal of giving investors the necessary knowledge =
to <br>
  make rational and profitable investment decisions. This publication =
does not=20

offer=20

carries risk.=20
  <br>
  It is recommended that any investment should be made after consulting =
with <br>

<br>
  believed to be reliable, but its accuracy cannot be assured. Past =

  of 1934, including statements regarding expected continual growth of =
the <br>
  featured company. Future-looking statements are based on expectations, =
<br>
  estimates, and projections at the time the statements are made that =
