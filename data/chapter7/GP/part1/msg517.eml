&nbsp;Dear Partner,<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; You may be suprised to received this letter from me since you do =
not know me<BR>
personally.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;I am Zokolu Zabuanga the first son of Kuanzo Zabuanga ,the most =
popular<BR>
farmer in zimbabwe who was murdered in the land dispute in my country.I =
got<BR>
your contact through network online hence deceided to write you.<BR>
<BR>
Before the death of my father he had taken me to johannesburg to =
deposite<BR>
the sum of 12.000000.00 dollars (twelve million dollars)in one of =
the<BR>
private security company in South Africa, as he foresaw the looming =
danger<BR>
in Zimbabwe this money was deposited in a box as gemstones to avoid =
much<BR>
dumorrage from the security company, this amount was meant for the =
purchase<BR>
of new machines and chemicals for farms and establishment of new farms =
in<BR>
Swaziland.<BR>
<BR>
This land problem came when Zimbabwean president.Mr Robert Mugabe =
introduced<BR>
a new land act reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and some =
black<BR>
farmers,and this resulted to the killing and mob action by Zimbabweean =
war<BR>
veterans and some lunatics in the society.<BR>
<BR>
Infact a lot of people were killed because of this land reform act for =
which<BR>
my father was one of the victims and may his soul rest in perfect =
peace.<BR>
<BR>
It is against this background that i and my family fled Zimbabwe for =
fear of<BR>
our lives and are currently staying in the Nederlands where i am seeking =
for<BR>
asylum and moreso have deceided to trasfer my father's money to a =
more<BR>
reliable foreign account since the law of the Nederlands prohibits a =
refugee<BR>
(asylum seeker) to open a bank account or to involve in any =
financial<BR>
transaction throughout the territorial zone of the Nederlands,as the =
eldelst<BR>
son of my father,I am saddled with the responsibilt of seeking a =
genuine<BR>
foreign account where this money could be transferd without the =
knowledge of<BR>
my goverment who are bent on taking everything we have got.<BR>
<BR>
The south African government seems to be playing along with them,i am =
faced<BR>
with the dilemma of moving this amount of money out of South Africa for =
fear<BR>
of going through the same experience in future,both countries have =
similar<BR>
political history and as a business man i am seeking for a partner who =
i<BR>
have to entrust my future and that of my family in his hands,i must let =
you<BR>
know that this transcation is risk free,if you accept to assit me and =
my<BR>
family,all i want you to do for me is to make arrangements with =
security<BR>
company to clear the consignment (funds)from their afilate office here =
in<BR>
the Nederlands as i have already giving dirctives for the consignments =
to be<BR>
brought to the Nederlands from South Africa but before then all =
modalities<BR>
will be put in place like the change of ownership to the consignment<BR>
(funds)and more importantly this money i intend to use for =
investments.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I have two options for you,firstly you can choose to have certain =
percentage<BR>
of the money for nominating your account for this transaction ,or you =
can go<BR>
into partnership with me for a proper profitable investment of the money =
in<BR>
your country,which ever the option you want please feel free to notify =
me,i<BR>
have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kind of expences incurred =
in<BR>
this process of this transaction.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
If you do not prefer a partnership i am willing to give you 15% of the =
total<BR>
sum while the remaning 80% will be for me and my family also for the<BR>
investment in your country.Contact me with the above email address while =
i<BR>
implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required in this =
transaction<BR>
till we put claims to the consignment (funds).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
THANKING YOU, AND GOD BLESS YOU.<BR>
<BR>
YOURS TRUELY,<BR>
