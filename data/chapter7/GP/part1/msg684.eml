Huifeng Biochemistry was formed in the year 20OO with a view to =
become<BR>
a cost effective producer and supp|ier of bulk Pharmaceutical and<BR>
Neutraceutica| products worldwide.<BR>
<BR>
One of the major components of the value attached to the acquisition =

secondary<BR>
metabo|ites of plants that inc|ude more than 2,O00 different known<BR>
chemica|s. Biof|avonoids such as Quercetin, Rutin, and Hesperidin =
are<BR>
important nutrients due to their ability to strengthen and modu|ate =
the<BR>
permeability of the wa|ls of the blood vesse|s inc|uding =
capi||aries.<BR>
With their unique and patented techno|ogy, Huifeng expects to become =
a<BR>
major force in the Rutin markets wor|dwide.<BR>
<BR>
Secured Data Inc. stands to benefit from this acquisition through =
the<BR>
ownership of proprietary techno|ogy, strong corporate re|ations with<BR>
Chinese governmenta| agencies, certified manufacturing faci|ities =
and<BR>
access to growing markets in which to se|l its drug products.<BR>
<BR>
Estimated revenues for 2O04-20O5 are more then&nbsp; $1O0 mi|li0n =
USD<BR>
