THE COMPANY<BR>
<BR>
Tradestar Corp. (OTC: TIRR), is a junior oil &amp; gas exploration =
company that specializes in re-entries and offset drilling for =
hydrocarbons in an area said to have &quot;the largest untapped =
potential for natural gas in North America.&quot; New prices and =
technologies have exponentially improved the economics and drill success =
rates average over 90%.=A0Tradestar Corp. is engaged in the low-risk =
development of proven oil and gas properties in Texas including the =
prolific Barnett Shale gas play south of Ft Worth . The rapid oil and =
gas price increases and recent advances in economical drilling, =
completion and production techniques, have resulted in:<BR>
<BR>

this extremely productive area.<BR>
<BR>
2=A0Co-mingling gas flow from several productive sands in each well -- =
increasing both initial and total output.<BR>
<BR>
3 The opportunity to drill new offset wells -- where success rates are =
typically over 90%. (Using Oil @ $35.00 and Gas @ $4.50 -- the pay back =
on well re-entry costs are estimated to average about 6 months.=A0Oil is =
currently $48 and gas=A0$6!!!!<BR>
<BR>
TIRR's strategy is to Strike Oil Again! Using current drilling =
technologies available today the company has begun to tap into low risk, =
high yield underdeveloped gas reserves in one of the most prolific plays =
(Barnett Shale in Central Texas) in the lower 48 states!!! =
