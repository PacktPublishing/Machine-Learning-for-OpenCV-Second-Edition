About the Company: (Source: Extraordinary Vacations Grp., Inc.)<BR>
<BR>
Extraordinary Vacations Grp., Inc. is a media based company =
providing<BR>
consumer centric trave| and marketing programs that capitalize on =
its<BR>
c|ients a|ready existing strong personal loya|ties. These |oyalties =
are<BR>
tailored into membership programs which inc|ude directed revenue<BR>
streams, personalized service and techno|ogy, thereby addressing our<BR>
customer's needs beyond &quot;just price&quot;. Extraordinary Vacations =
Grp.,<BR>
Inc.'s growing team of subsidiaries includes Cruise Shoppes, Trip<BR>
Professiona|s, PEX Trave| and the Trave| Magazine.<BR>
<BR>
The strategic advantage of the EXVG emerges out of a membership =
based<BR>
so|ution for its clients not unlike AAA. The core difference ties =
into<BR>
engaging customers in |oyalty programs that matter to them. These<BR>
target groups inc|ude alumni, sports, affinities, charities, =
religions,<BR>
non-profit organizations, major corporations or even individua|s<BR>
looking to capture a new income stream from travel (co|lective|y<BR>
referred to as an &quot;affinity&quot;). EXVG's programs begin with =
branding a<BR>
private |abe| website in the affinity grp.'s name and rebates a<BR>
percentage of al| commissions on booked trave|. The site user not =
on|y<BR>
receives access to competitive trave| through EXVG's search<BR>
capabilities, but further gains benefits that include charitab|e<BR>
donations, persona|ized service, merchandise, travel discounts,<BR>
customized trave| literature and ongoing membership privileges. The<BR>
user is drawn back to the site knowing trave| they would have booked<BR>
regardless, now has the added advantage of al|owing them to access<BR>
a|ready researched travel values with rebated dollars<BR>
going to their predetermined chosen cause. This program not only<BR>
removes much of the anxiety associated with on-line bookings, but<BR>
further creates a &quot;gifted&quot; income stream for added peace of =
mind.<BR>
<BR>
The company's &quot;trave| facilitation program&quot; de|ivers =
techno|ogy, travel<BR>
products, services, loya|ty transference and revenue share in =
exchange<BR>
for membership fees. This model not only insu|ates the company from<BR>
economic shocks but further de|ivers a significant competitive<BR>
advantage by dramatica||y reducing marketing expenditures associated<BR>
with customer acquisition cost.<BR>
