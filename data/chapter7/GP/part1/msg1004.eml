&gt;When children stand still they have done some ill<BR>
&gt;Nah mind how pumpkin vine run, he must dry up one day.<BR>
&gt;Silence is golden<BR>
&gt;Take heed of reconciled enemies and of meat twice boiled<BR>
&gt;Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that =
go down into the pit.<BR>
&gt;Cold hands, warm heart<BR>
&gt;A man's reach should exceed his grasp.<BR>
&gt;All are not cooks that walk with long knives<BR>
&gt;Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, =
and no man regarded.</FONT>
