There was a sheriff looking for a new deputy, and a Redneck went in =
to<BR>
apply for the job. &quot;OK,&quot; said the sheriff, &quot;What is =
1+1?&quot; The redneck<BR>
thought for a minute, and finally said, &quot;11.&quot;The sheriff =
asked, &quot;What two<BR>
days of the week start with the letter T?&quot; The redneck said, =
&quot;That's easy,<BR>
Today and Tomorrow.&quot; The sheriff said, &quot;Now the last question, =
who killed<BR>
Abraham Lincoln?&quot; The redneck thought really hard, and at last =
said, &quot;I<BR>
don't know.&quot; The sheriff smiled and said, &quot;Well, why don't you =
go home and<BR>
work on that.&quot; So the redneck went home and his wife asked him how =
it went.<BR>
The redneck replied, &quot;Great! He already put me on a murder =
case!&quot;<BR>
Perry is scheduled to appear in court Tuesday. His attorney, Charles<BR>
Giesen, did not return a telephone message Thursday.<BR>
A notoriously absent-minded professor was one day observed walking =
along<BR>
the street with one foot continually in the gutter, the other on the<BR>
pavement.A pupil meeting him said:&quot;Good evening, professor. How =
are<BR>
you?&quot;&quot;Well,&quot; answered the professor, &quot;I thought I =
was all right when I left<BR>
home, but now I don't know what's the matter with me. I've been limping =
for<BR>
the last half-hour.&quot;<BR>
