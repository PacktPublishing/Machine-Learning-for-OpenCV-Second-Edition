<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Dear Sir/ Madam<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It will surely be a surprise to you to have received this mail from =
me.<BR>
I got your contact through your country&#8217;s Trade Journal here =
in<BR>
Holland. I was directed to you after much fasting and prayer, =
seeking<BR>
God intervention in my life regarding my planes to seek a foreign<BR>
trustworthy person whom will serve as guardian of my Fund for<BR>
investment.<BR>
<BR>
Please do not disclose my business intentions to any person or group =
of<BR>
person, because I want it to be handled as confidential as possible.<BR>
This is the reason why I decided to contact you by email.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
First I must introduce myself. I am Mr. Sanko Otumuku the son of Mr.<BR>
Kuala&nbsp; Otumuku one of the key officer who where saving under the =
then<BR>
head of state Major Johnny Koroma.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As you are fully aware, my country relied heavily on the foreign<BR>
earning generated from Diamond Trade. This money was personally kept =
by<BR>
the then President, Major Johnny Koroma, since our banking system =
had<BR>
collapsed during the war.<BR>
However, as the war progressed, it became apparent that we were =
going<BR>
to lose the war to the superior and better armed West African Allied<BR>
Forces (ECOMOG). At this point, the key officers of the =
Administration<BR>
started making frantic efforts on how to leave Sierra Leone safely,<BR>
thereby sharing the proceeds / money from the Diamond Trade. My =
father<BR>
being one of the key officers who succeeded in getting the sum of<BR>
US$14.5 Million (Fourteen&nbsp; Million, Five Hundred Thousand United =
States<BR>
Dollars).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This Money was transferred&nbsp; through diplomatic means to South =
Africa<BR>
and kept in a security company, I and my family lived for good three<BR>
years in South Africa till the untimely death&nbsp; of my father =
through<BR>
heart attack after 3 years of exile in South Africa, I automatically<BR>
became the legal owner of the said money since I was the only =
surviving<BR>
son&nbsp; in the family.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
My wife and my two beautiful son and a daughter God has giving me =
are<BR>
now still in South Africa, after I realized I need to invest the =
Fund<BR>
outside African country, I decided to convey the box to the =
Netherlands<BR>
with the help of the courier company, on arriving here, I deposited =
it<BR>
with the courier company for safe keeping although the courier =
company&nbsp;<BR>
is not aware of the content of the consignment/ Box.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Presently I'm living in The Netherlands seeking political asylum, =
just<BR>
to make sure I can secure my staying here also to monitor my Fund.<BR>
Although we have not met, I need you as a trustworthy person that =
will<BR>
assist me and my family to transfer this money to his or her account<BR>
outside The Netherlands, as the strict monetary laws here do not =
allow<BR>
asylum seekers certain financial rights to open a foreign account.<BR>
I shall be grateful if you assist me to accomplish this transaction =
and<BR>
hoping too that you remain trustworthy, that you will not take any<BR>
advantage of me after the Fund is under your custody.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As I promise you that, you will never regret knowing me, you will =
not<BR>
regret your effort and assistance; I am prepared to give you 20% of =
the<BR>
total sum while 5%will be set aside for all the expenses incurred<BR>
during the course of this transaction. The rest 75% will be for my<BR>
family investment in your country.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;Note that this transaction is 100% risk free as such the only =
thing I<BR>
ask from you is total assistance to transfer this money, complete =
trust<BR>
and assurance that my own part of the money will be safe when<BR>
transferred to your country.<BR>
<BR>
If you are touched and interested in assisting me please contact me =
by<BR>
email.<BR>
