Hi Varou,=20
<p>
A depressed person may also dwell on negative thoughts, focus on =
unpleasant experiences, describe themselves as a failure, report that =
things are hopeless, and feel as though they are a burden to others. The =
changes in mood brought on by depression frequently result in feelings =
of sadness, irritability, anger, emptiness, and/or anxiety. There are =
also some types of depression, including Bipolar Disorder, in which =
depressive episodes alternate with manic or hypomanic episodes which may =
include feelings of agitation and euphoria. A severe or long-term =
depressive episode can substantially erode self-esteem and may result in =
thoughts of death and suicide.
<p>

to provide a convenient, globally accessible, affordable and safe means =
