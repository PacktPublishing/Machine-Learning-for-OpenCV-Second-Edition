Your contact address got to me via export promotions council, your<BR>
reliability and trustworthiness in business transaction was the main<BR>

deal.<BR>
I am the Project Director of the Department of Petroleum Resources<BR>

of<BR>
my Ministry,In collaboration with my colleagues, we have agreed to<BR>
transfer out of the Country through Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) =
some<BR>
amount and we will later reinvest it abroad after the success of<BR>
this transaction.<BR>
The amount involved is Forty Five Million, USDollar =
(US$45,000,000.00).<BR>
This is as a result of over inflated amount of a contract,The =
contract<BR>
has been already executed and the original contractor had collected =
his<BR>
full and final payment.<BR>
Base on our status as senior government officials in top sensitive<BR>
position of trust, we cannot stand to claim this money =
ourselves,hence,<BR>
I decided to contact you.<BR>
Accordingly, I have consulted and held meetings with some key =
officials<BR>
of the corporation, Federal Ministry of Finance and Central Bank of<BR>
Nigeria and we decided to involve a gentle, honest trustworthy and<BR>
competent partner overseas who could provide two units of KTT<BR>
COMPUTERONIC DISKETTE SMDB 3000 STORAGE FACILITY, CAPACITOR 1190.<BR>
This is special in built diskette with its own software for =
transfering<BR>
money worldwide, This is not an ordinary floppy diskette, but made =
for<BR>
automatic machine for money transfer.<BR>
All modalities for this transfer have been fully worked out, we have<BR>
already secured a preliminary order to effect this payment.<BR>
<BR>
We now require from you your BANKING PARTICULARS where this money =
will<BR>
be lodged into and the Beneficiaries name, It could be personal or<BR>
corporate,MOST CONFIDENTIAL FAX AND TELEPHONE NUMBERS,for smooth<BR>
transfer of this money into your bank account.<BR>
These information will enable us put APPLICATION OF CLAIM for the<BR>
release of this money from concerned Government Agencies and it will<BR>
last for 14-21 working days.<BR>
For your assistance we have agreed to give 20% to you, 70% for us =
and<BR>
10% for any miscellaneous expenses in getting the diskette.<BR>
The business is 100% safe on your part, but you have to keep it very<BR>
CONFIDENTIAL.<BR>
Do not inform your bankers yet unless instructed by us. also,<BR>
your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful<BR>
execution of this transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you =
and<BR>
hope<BR>
that you will not dissapoint me. Please send reply to indicate your<BR>
willingness in assisting us so that I will direct you on what next =
to<BR>
do.Please do include your direct telephone/Fax numbers upon your<BR>
response.<BR>
