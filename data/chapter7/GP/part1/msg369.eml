events or performance are not statements of historical<BR>
fact and may be &quot;forward looking statements.&quot;Forward<BR>
|ooking statements are based on expectations,<BR>

factors that raise doubt about its ability to continue<BR>

no revenue in its most recent quarter. It is not<BR>
current|y an operating company. The company is going<BR>
to need financing. If that financing does not occur,<BR>
the company may not be ab|e to continue as a going<BR>
concern in which case you could |ose your entire<BR>

are not limited to, the abi|ity of the Company to<BR>
comp|ete a p|anned bridge financing, market<BR>
conditions, the general acceptance of the Company's<BR>
