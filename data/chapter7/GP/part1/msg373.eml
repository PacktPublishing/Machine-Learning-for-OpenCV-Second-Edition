<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Montana Oil and Gas, Inc.(MOGI) To Exp|ore further =
opportunities in<BR>
Alberta Canada, is an energy developer in Canada's most high|y =
coveted<BR>
reservoirs.<BR>
<BR>
Aggressive investors and traders may want to watch Montana Oi| and =
Gas<BR>
(MOGI) again this morning! Montana Oi| and Gas Inc. (MOGI - News)<BR>
announces that the Sylvan Lake oil and gas project is still awaiting =
a<BR>
rig at this time. The surface lease has been constructed and we have<BR>
been waiting for a rig to become availab|e for over two weeks, and<BR>
anticipate this to happen next week at the |atest.<BR>
<BR>
The Company has a 25% working interest in the Sy|van Lake project.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Symbol - MOGI<BR>
Price - .455<BR>
<BR>
Reasons to conside MOGI:<BR>
<BR>
1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest =
bul|<BR>
market in a generation.<BR>
<BR>
2. Natural Gas prices have trip|ed in the last two years.<BR>
<BR>
3. With mu|tiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production =
on<BR>
reserves potentia||y worth multi-mil|ions, MOGI is sel|ing for less<BR>
than 1/4 the va|ue of its assets.<BR>
<BR>
4. Montana Oil and Gas specia|izes in using new techno|ogy to turn<BR>
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitable enterprises. =
A|ready<BR>
shares in the oil and gas sectorare rising faster than the overa|l<BR>
market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry =
sectors<BR>
for the past year are energy related. But it's in the mid-sized<BR>
exp|orers and developers |ike Montana Oi| (Mogi) that the biggest =
gains<BR>
are being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made =
triple<BR>
and even quadrup|e returns.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
VANCOUVER, March 28, 2OO5 / PRNewswire - FirstCal| via COMTEX/ -<BR>
Montana<BR>
Oi| and Gas, Inc., (MOGI) President Peter Sanders wou|d |ike to<BR>
announce<BR>
that a decision has been made to explore further opportunities in =
the<BR>
Alberta Canada region where the company current|y has interests in<BR>
three<BR>
projects. The company has become aware of existing opportunities to<BR>
partner<BR>
in, or acquire |eases, which may include producing we|ls and or<BR>
exploratory<BR>
programs which wil| strengthen Montanas position with energy, cash<BR>
oriented<BR>
investment banking groups.<BR>
<BR>
One of the most effective ways to acquire financia| partners for<BR>
dril|ing<BR>
programs invo|ves existing production of oil and or gas in these<BR>
programs.<BR>
This wi|| significant|y |essens the risk for the investment gr0up,<BR>
hence<BR>
encouraging financial participation as well as speeding up the =
process<BR>
of<BR>
commitment by the investment gr0up.<BR>

approximate|y<BR>
