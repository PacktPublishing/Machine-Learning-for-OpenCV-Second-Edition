3,600 gallons of natural gas liquids daily. A more detailed =

the helium production and an operating agreement with Colorado =
Interstate<BR>

liquids<BR>
recovered by the plant are sold to various parties.<BR>

discussions with respect to predictions, expectations, beliefs, =

performance<BR>
are not statements of historical fact and may be &quot;forward =
looking<BR>
statements.&quot;Forward looking statements are based on expectations, =
estimates<BR>
and projections at the time the statements are made that involve a =
number of<BR>
risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results or events to =
differ<BR>
materially from those presently anticipated. Forward looking statements =
in<BR>
this action may be identified through the use of words such as =
&quot;projects&quot;,<BR>

&quot;anticipates,&quot; &quot;estimates,&quot; =
&quot;believes,&quot;<BR>
&quot;understands&quot; or that by statements indicating certain actions =
&quot;may,&quot;<BR>
&quot;could,&quot; or &quot;might&quot; occur. As with many microcap =
stocks, today's company has<BR>
additional risk factors worth noting.The company has a going concern =
opinion<BR>
from its auditor, has relied on loans from officers and an affiliate<BR>
shareholder to pay expenses, has a large accumulated deficit since =
its<BR>
inception and is involved in litigation in the normal course of its<BR>
business, none of which is anticipated to have a material adverse effect =
on<BR>
its financial condition, operations or prospects. The Company will need =
to<BR>
obtain financing. There can be no assurance of that happening. On June =
7,<BR>
2004, Nathaniel Energy Corporation issued a press release that its =
helium<BR>
and gas processing facility in Keyes, Oklahoma experienced a fire, =
that<BR>
there were no injuries, and that repairs are underway. The Growth =
