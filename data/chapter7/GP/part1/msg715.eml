<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
Realistic effects...<BR>
<BR>
&quot;My husband and I both did the cleanse in the Fall of '98.<BR>
We both lost weight and cleansed our entire systems, not<BR>
just the colon. My husband passed things that had been inside<BR>
for a long time, like bubble gum he used to swallow when he<BR>
was 8-10 years old. His cholesterol dropped around 60 points<BR>
in the month!&quot; ... C.M., Bourbonnais, IL.<BR>
<BR>
Due to poor eating habits, it has become increasingly clear<BR>
that almost every person in this country over six years old<BR>
is developing serious problems in the intestinal tract which<BR>
in later years may contribute to the development of various<BR>
acute, chronic and degenerative diseases such as cancer, heart<BR>
trouble and diabetes, as well as lack of energy, premature aging,<BR>
poor eyesight, memory loss, a poor complexion and wrinkles.<BR>
<BR>
It is estimated that over 98% of disease can be a tributed<BR>
directly or indirectly to an unhealthy digestive system. As<BR>
Dr. Bernard Jensen (pioneering natureopathic physician and<BR>
master herbalist in the 60's and 70's) says, &quot;It is the bowel<BR>
that invariably has to be cared for first before any effective<BR>
healing can take place.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I started the bowel detox program just a few days ago and<BR>
cannot believe the difference in how I feel!! I have a sense<BR>
of well being and energy that I just haven't felt in years!<BR>
Thanks for making this available!&quot; ... J.L., Dothan, AL.<BR>

Toxins from a polluted and congested bowel constantly seep<BR>
into the bloodstream and lymph systems. They eventually settle<BR>
into the weakest areas of the body, then various symptoms<BR>
develop and are given names according to those areas and the<BR>
degree of cell degeneration. Unfortunately the symptoms resulting<BR>
from the toxic overload in the bowel are generally treated rather<BR>
than the cause.<BR>
<BR>
As Dr. Jensen puts it, &quot;Every tissue is fed by the blood, which<BR>
is supplied by the bowel. When the bowel is dirty, the blood is<BR>
dirty and so on to the organs and tissues.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Disease can only be permanently overcome when the &quot;cause&quot; =
is<BR>
addressed, rather than simply treating the symptom. The Starter<BR>
Intestinal Cleanse Program gets to the cause by removing the<BR>
mucoid fecal substance-the source of most disease.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I want to thank you again for your incredibly effective =
intestinal<BR>
cleanse program. When I first discovered your program my wife had<BR>
a severe case of ulcerative colitis. The doctor checked her colon<BR>
and declared that her entire large intestine was inflamed. Within<BR>
3 days of starting the intestinal cleanse program we saw a =
difference<BR>
and within one to two weeks she was feeling much better. Now she is<BR>
back to her original self. Thank you again for all your help.&quot;<BR>

<BR>
This starter intestinal cleanse program is the most fundamental of<BR>
all cleansing action. The body's blood system, lymph system, =
digestive<BR>
job of elimination. If the colon is tired or overloaded, then the =
other<BR>
areas of the body become stressed. If the stress continues long =
enough,<BR>
disease results. Therefore, it becomes important to give the =
intestine<BR>
a helping hand.<BR>
<BR>
There is no more effective method for deep, therapeutic intestinal<BR>
cleansing than our Starter Intestinal Cleanse Program. Click on the<BR>
