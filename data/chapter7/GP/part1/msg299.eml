HOUSTON BUSINESS WIRE. Nov. 22, 2004. Falcon Natural Gas Corp. =
(OTCBB:FNGC - News), announced today that it has secured a total of =
11,000,000 in equity financing with Cornell Capital Partners LP.<BR>

to re-enter its Lower DB3 prospect, which is classified as a PUD and has =
20 BCF of proven-undeveloped gas reserves. The prospect is located at =
the Avoca Minerals property in Southern Louisiana, one of the richest =
natural gas producing areas in North America.<BR>
<BR>
The remaining 10,000,000 was secured under a standby equity agreement. =
These funds can be drawn at the company's discretion based on funding =
requirements, subject to an effective registration with the SEC.<BR>

&quot;We are very pleased to have Cornell Capital Partners join our =
current investors,&quot; said Fred B. Zaziski, Chief Executive Officer =
of Falcon Natural Gas Corp. &quot;This financing significantly =
strengthens Falcon's liquidity and will allow us to move at a faster =
pace with our exploration program.&quot;<BR>

nity,&quot; said Hamid Fashandi, Senior Vice President of Cornell =

Reasons to consider FNGC.<BR>
<BR>
1. The Company's explorations include prospects with 100 to 200 bcf of =
gas reserves and another with up to 570 bcf of gas reserves. These =
propects have been confirmed by two independant sources. If economic =
natural gas reserves are found and given today's market prices, these =
prospects have a potential estimated market value of up to 698 million =
(USD).<BR>
<BR>
2. Natural gas prices have sky rocketed in the past year due to =
political turmoil in the middle east and the growing number of new =
vehicles in the world. Gas prices are expected to continue on the rise =
in the coming months. Natural gas prices in last few months alone have =
risen up over 50%.<BR>
<BR>
3. Falcon's prospects are located right next door to one of Texas's =
greatest natural gas finds.<BR>
