<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Attn: Subscribers and Investors<BR>
Our choices Were UP Over 300% for 2004<BR>
Here is our FIRST choice for 2005<BR>
<BR>
Active Stock Breakout<BR>
American IDC Corp. OTC: ACNI<BR>
Price: .04<BR>
Target: .15 in 5 Days<BR>
<BR>
Major Breaking News: ACNI Launches Broadband Internet TV, =
Technologically Superior to AOL TV Clips and Movie Trailers. Investors =
Brace for Worldwide Revenue Explosion.<BR>
<BR>
ACNI is the Internet Success story for 2005 making them the hottest =
undervalued stock at this price level where shares are ready to explode =
on huge investor attention. ACNI has completed the worldwide launch of =
its revolutionary Broadband Internet Television, solidifying explosive =
revenues for this proprietary video technology powerhouse. While most =
investors are completely unaware of this significant achievement, that =
will change very quickly.&nbsp; ACNI is positioned much like today's =
cable TV giants that invested heavily in their technology over 20 years =
ago and are now earning a thousand times over what was initially spent =
each year from their current subscribers.<BR>
<BR>
The driving force behind ACNI's technology that enables streaming 24/7 =
Broadband Internet Television, by comparison, is more highly =
sophisticated than the partial movie trailers or 15-second clips from =
&quot;Top TV Moments&quot; shown by AOL to subscribers. Combine the fact =
that ACNI is continuously providing thousands of revenue generating =
Hollywood classic movies, with expanding content of Sports, Music, =
Educational, Television Series, and Children's Programming, clearly =
provides a superior cutting-edge advantage keeping the Company at the =
forefront in the fastest growing sector of the Internet.<BR>
<BR>
ACNI's programming through its 100% Company-owned network, =
E-TVHollywood, is the first full-screen Broadband Digital streaming =
channel on the Internet in High-Definition (HD) Quality. The =
technological break through that supplies the groundwork for record =
setting multi-millions for ACNI is powered by MPEG2 using movie industry =
code which allows for the necessary transcoding into video for =
Broadband.<BR>
<BR>
ACNI is the perfect play for explosive short-term gains with a small =
float estimated at under 20 million shares and a market value at around =
1.5 million. We expect massive block buying with record setting price =
and volume breakouts. We are advising accumulation by our subscribers as =
huge news is due to be released that will send share prices soaring.<BR>
<BR>
