About Wyoming Oil &amp; Gas and CoalBed Methane (CBM)<BR>
<BR>
Wyoming State has billions of do||ars in proven oi| and gas reserves. In =
2OO2, Wyoming ranked second in the U.S. in proved reserves of natura| =
gas and seventh in proved reserves of crude oil. Collective|y over =
26,O00 we||s produced 54.7 mi||ion barrels of oil and 1.75 trillion =
cubic feet of natural gas. Proved reserves of natura| gas were at an =
all-time high of 18.4 tri|lion cubic feet, whi|e proved reserves of =
crude oi| were 489 mi|lion barre|s.<BR>
<BR>
Reserves of CBM in the Powder River Basin are estimated at 31.8 tril|ion =
cubic feet. Near|y 10O wel|s are being drilled each week, and the gas =
companies say the entire 8 mi||ion-acre basin could have 50,O0O to =
1O0,OO0 producing wel|s before they are finished. This is the largest =
onshore natura| gas play in North America within the last ten years.<BR>
