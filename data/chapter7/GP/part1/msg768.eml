bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; REQUEST FOR BUSINESS PARTNERSHIP<BR>
<BR>
In my quest for a reliable and trusted partner for a highly important =
and lucrative venture cum investment, I came across your contact as a =
reliable partner for this venture.<BR>
<BR>
I am Sir.Richard Mbali,one of the senior Accountants of AMALGAMATED BANK =
OF SOUTH AFRICA (ABSA). To highlight you on this proposal, there is an =
account opened in this bank since 1980 . After going through it, I =
discovered that if I do not remit this money out urgently it would be =
forfeited for nothing. The owner of this account is Mr.Ben Andreas, a =
foreigner from Sumatra,Indonesia and a miner at Kruger gold co., a =
geologist by profession.Mr. Ben Andreas was with his Family on holiday =
in his country.They died in one of the Coastal areas across Asia that =
was&nbsp;&nbsp; hit by massive tsunamis triggered by the worst =
earthquake in 40 years.The number of people killed throughout Asia has =
now reached over 226,000 with tens of thousands still missing.<BR>
It is a confirmed fact that Mr.Ben Andreas and his Family lost their =
lives on December 26,2004 during the earthquake that occurred off the =
west coast of sumatra in Indonesia.This was further proved to be a =
reality by Dr.Doti Indrasantra,a director in the Ministry of =
Health&nbsp;&nbsp; Affairs Department in Sumatra.Dr. Indrasantra visited =
South Africa last year on a Hiv/Aids health programme(2004 INTERNATIONAL =
HEALTH TEAM CONFERENCE HELD IN SANDTON,JOHANNESBURG).i was introduced to =
him by the late Mr.Ben Andreas&nbsp; who i am his banker.I confirmed =
from Dr.Indransatra that Mr.Ben Andreas and his Family died shortly =
after visiting him in his house in Sumatra<BR>
No other person knows about this and my investigation further proved to =
me that his company does not know anything about this account and the =
amount involved as he made it his personal account. The money =
outstanding before his death was (USD 26 Million) Twenty Six Million =
United States Dollars.<BR>
I am now contacting you as a foreigner because this money cannot be =
approved&nbsp; to a national with a local bank account here. But can =
only be approved to any foreign account because the money is in US =
dollars and the former owner, a foreigner. I implore you to act as =
foreigner and beneficiary to the fund as I will then intimate you on the =
processes abound as well as procure all the necessary documents required =
to lay claim to the money.<BR>
<BR>
If you are capable and willing to handle such amount in strict =
confidence and trust according to my instructions and advice for our =
mutual benefit I shall highly appreciate. I need trusted person in this =
business because I do not want to make mistakes; I need your strong<BR>
assurance and trust. With my position now in the office I can =
effect&nbsp; transfer of this money to any foreigner's reliable account, =
which you can provide with assurance&nbsp; that this money will be =
intact pending my arrival in your country for disbursement. On the =
alternative, you can come<BR>
down here to South Africa for us to meet one to one.<BR>
<BR>
Send me your private telephone and fax numbers upon receipt of this =
proposal, if you genuinely want to assist and be a co-partner. I will =
also wants us to meet face to face, to enable us sign a binding =
agreement.As soon as you receive this money into a foreign account or =
any account of your choice where the fund will be safe. I will proceed =
to your country for onward percentage distributions and investment. I =
need your full co-operation to make this work because the management is =
ready to approve this payment to any foreigner, who has correct =
information of this account, which I will give to you later =
immediately.I will use my<BR>
position and influence to effect legal approvals and onward transfer of =
this money to your account with appropriate clearance forms of the =
ministries and foreign exchange departments.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;At the conclusion of this business, for your assistance, 25% of =
the total amount will be&nbsp; accrue for you, 70% for me, while 5% will =
be for expenses both parties might have incurred during the process of =
the transfer.<BR>
<BR>
I implore you to maintain the absolute confidentiality of this =
transaction.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Your earliest response is urgently awaited.<BR>
Truely Yours,<BR>
<BR>
