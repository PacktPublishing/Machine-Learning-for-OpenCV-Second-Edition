                          $50 per a barrel we believe there is a lot of =

adjusted=20
                          inflated dollars oil has not yet hit its all =

                          of $73 from the 1970s. However, unlike the oil =

                          to stay with us for a long time. Simply put =
the demand=20

once the=20
                          bubble bursts will result in oil back in the =
$20-30=20

                          today that require oil &amp; gas to propel =

                          economies and this fact alone will keep oil =

                          these higher levels. ABDV has already aligned =

Energy=20
                          field. These individuals will help locate =
