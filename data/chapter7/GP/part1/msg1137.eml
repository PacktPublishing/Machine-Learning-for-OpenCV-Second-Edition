                  <p>Interactive Motorsports &amp; Entertainment =
Corporation's (OTCBB:IMTS) wholly-owned subsidiary, Perfect Line, Inc., =
owns and operates the unique NASCAR Silicon Motor Speedway racing =
centers. The NASCAR Silicon Motor Speedway racing centers are the =
largest chain of officially licensed NASCAR-brand entertainment and =
retail stores in the world. IMTS's wholly-owned subsidiary, Perfect =
Line, was formed by William R. Donaldson and partners to acquire the =
assets of Silicon Entertainment, Inc., which invested approximately 60 =
million dollars since 1994 to develop racing simulator technology and =
create the initial mall-based entertainment centers. Mr. Donaldson, 45, =
Chairman and CEO of the &quot;new&quot; IMTS, has been a major influence =
in the International racing industry for over 24 years. He served as the =
Executive Vice President of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway (IMS, the =
largest spectator stadium in the world), and concurrently served as =
President of IMS subsidiaries, IMS Properties and IMS Events. At IMS, he =
was on the executive management team that initiated such events as the =
NASCAR Brickyard 400, Indy FanFest, The Senior PGA Tournament held at =
Brickyard Crossing, the Indy 200 at Walt Disney World, and launch of the =
Indy Racing League. He formed his own company in 1997, managed the =
Inaugural NASCAR Winston Cup event at Las Vegas Motor Speedway in March =
of 1998, and launched the American and European Le Mans Series from =
1999-2001. NASCAR Silicon Motor Speedway stores are the largest chain of =
officially licensed NASCAR-branded entertainment and retail stores in =
the world. IMTS has integrated sophisticated proprietary racing =
simulator technology with an exclusive NASCAR license for motion-based =
entertainment and licenses for popular NASCAR tracks and teams. NASCAR =
racing is considered the number one spectator sport in America , with an =
estimated 75 million fans and over $1 billion in NASCAR-branded retail =
merchandise sales.</p>
                  <p>The racing centers are designed to give customers =
an experience that comes as close to real NASCAR Winston Cup racing as =
possible. Each racing center utilizes between 4,500 and 8,000 square =
feet, and features 8 to 14 Winston Cup race car simulators, along with a =
dedicated merchandise area featuring NASCAR's top drivers and teams. =
Each race experience includes training and a 10 to 13 lap race on an =
authentic NASCAR racetrack. All of the cars within the racing center =
compete against each other. Additional computer generated racecars are =
added to create a full field competition. Full detail race results are =
available after the race in the Winner's Circle, and videos of each race =
are available for purchase. </p>
