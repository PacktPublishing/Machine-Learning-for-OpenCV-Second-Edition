<font size=3D"2">The American Management Association in its "Workplace =
Monitoring &amp;
Surveillance" report, already warned that <strong>73.5%</strong> of =
companies <u>"record
and review" the activities of their employees</u>. <strong>People can, =
have and will be
fired when surfing pornography at work.</strong></font></p>
<p><font size=3D"2">The risk comes not just from internet history, but =
more importantly from
temporary files and activity logs that cannot be deleted from PC's. =
<u>Bosses can access
these logs and review exactly what you've been doing.</u></font></p>
<p><font color=3D"#FF0000" size=3D"3"><strong>Internationally, hundreds =

</font><br>
<font size=3D"2">Bringing in a PC for repair can easily turn into a =
social disaster. One PC
technician uncovered hundreds of pornographic sites, some illegal and =
notified
authorities. <strong>With evidence buried deep in your system's =
temporary files,
activity logs and recent document logs you're handing over a PC filled =
with dirt.</strong>
<font color=3D"#FF0000">There's no easier way to be =
exposed!</font></font></p>
<p><font size=3D"2">And the risk goes on. File swapping, disks that have =
been in your PC or
simply a friend using your system can expose your most private files and =
sites - even if
you visited them on accident.</font><br>
