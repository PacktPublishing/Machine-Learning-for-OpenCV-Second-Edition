Attention: The President/CEO.<BR>
<BR>
I am barrister Ruben Chizea(Esq.), a Solicitor &amp; Financial Attorney/ =
Consultant in Durban, South Africa.&nbsp; I was the personal attorney to =
late Mr. Donald Hanson who was an expatriate mining =
consultant/contractor with the South African Mining corporation. Mr. =
Donald Hanson here-in-after referred as my client was also an oil =
contractor and my most valued client.<BR>
<BR>
Mr. Donald Hanson made a numbered time (Fixed)deposit for =
US$15,000,000.00 (Fifteen Million US Dollars Only) in December 1999 in a =
bank in South Africa (name withheld),with a standing statement/agreement =
with the bank that all correspondences in respect to the fixed deposit =
contract must be sent to him through my humble self. Upon maturity, the =
routine notification was sent to me and I dispatched to his forwarding =
address as usual without any reply. After a month, I sent a reminder =
which I received from the bank without any reply again. Finally, I =
discovered from my client's contract employers- that he died among many =
others in the Kenya Airways flight of 31st January, 2000 that crashed =
into the Atlantic Ocean in Abidjan, Cote D'Ivoire.<BR>
Shortly, before his death, he had instructed me to prepare his WILL but =
without a named beneficiary yet. He had already signed the WILL and was =
contemplating on making his pet dog the beneficiary before he made a =
trip to Cote D'Ivore which led to his death.&nbsp; On further =
investigations, I found out that he does not have any other Attorney =
apart from me and that he had no other WILL apart from the one I =
prepared for him.&nbsp; All attempts to trace his next of kin or any =
relation was fruitless. I also discovered that Mr. Donald Hanson did not =
declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including =
his fixed deposit contract with the bank in South Africa.<BR>
<BR>
I am contacting you based on the official letter I just received from =
his bankers reminding me that South African law states that at the =
expiration of 5 (five) years the money will revert to the ownership of =
the South African Government if I do not confirm the next of kin to =
claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a =
foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Donald Hanson so that =
the fruits of this old man's labor will not go into the hands of some =
corrupt government officials. Note that this transaction is simple and =
risk free because I will provide expert legal services that will =
guarantee the successful execution of this deal. I wish to point out =
that after the claims, I would want 20% of this money to be shared among =
charity organizations, while the remaining 80% is shared equally between =
us. Most importantly, I would also require your assistance towards =
investing my share in your country or anywhere as you may advice. If you =
are interested, please contact me via my email below. Upon your =
response, I shall provide you with more details and how we shall proceed =
with the claims. I expect you to observe utmost confidentiality and be =
rest assured that this transaction would be profitable for both of =
us.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; Awaiting your urgent reply via my email: rubench1@yahoo.com<BR>
<BR>
Thanks &amp; Regards<BR>
