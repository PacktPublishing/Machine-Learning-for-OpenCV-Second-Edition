A man who wanted to rest on the ground used a jar as a pillow. It was =
so<BR>
hard that he asked his servant to staff it with feathers to make it =
soft. A<BR>
pupil was talking about the recent fire in his school. &quot;I knew it =
was going<BR>
to happen.&quot; he said, &quot;Because we've been practicing for it =
all<BR>
year&quot;.Computer manufacturers are considering changing the =
instructional<BR>
words &quot;Press Any Key&quot; to &quot;Press Return Key&quot;, because =
too many people have<BR>
been calling to ask where the &quot;Any&quot; key is.<BR>
Osama Bin Laden, a Canadian, and President Bush were walking down =
the<BR>
street when they saw a golden lamp. They rubbed it and a genie came out =
and<BR>
said, &quot;I will grant each one a wish that!/s 3 together.&quot; The =
Canadian said,<BR>
&quot;I am a father and my son will be a farmer so I want the soil in =
Canada to<BR>
be forever fertile.&quot; The genie said the magic words and the wish =
came true.<BR>
Osama looked amazed so he wished for a wall around Afghanistan the =
genie<BR>
said the magic words and again the wish came true. President Bush =
said<BR>
&quot;Genie, tell me more about this wall,&quot; the genie said,!1 It!/s =
50 feet thick<BR>
and 500 feet tall so nothing can get in and nothing can get out.&quot; =
President<BR>
Bush said,!1 Wow! That!/s a big bridge...Fill it with water!!!<BR>
