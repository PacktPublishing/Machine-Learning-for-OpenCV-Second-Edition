<BR>There is a scarcity of friendship, but not of friends.


<BR>Colonies do not cease to be colonies because they are =
independent.=0D



<BR><BR>That all men are equal is a proposition to which, at ordinary =
times, no sane human being has ever given his assent.When we do the best =
we can, we never know what miracle is wrought in our life, or in the =
life of another.<BR><BR>Wise men learn many things from their =
enemies.<BR>Today's city is the most vulnerable social structure ever =
conceived by man.

<br><br>When it is not necessary to change, it is necessary not to =
change.<br>Love Him, and keep Him for thy Friend, who, when all go away, =
will not forsake thee, nor suffer thee to perish at the last.<br>I think =
I am a much better actor than I have allowed myself to be.



<br>Paris, a city of gaieties and pleasures, where four-fifths of the =
inhabitants die of grief. [About Paris]<BR><BR>Greed, like the love of =
comfort, is a kind of fear.



<br><br>There is never a better measure of what a person is than what he =
does when he is absolutely free to choose.<br><br>Autobiography begins =
with a sense of being alone. It is an orphan form.Look around for a =
place to sow a few seeds.
<BR>A heart well prepared for adversity in bad times hopes, and in good =
times fears for a change in fortune.



Artists to my mind are the real architects of change, and not the =
political legislators who implement change after the fact.


<BR>Give me a lever long enough, and a prop strong enough, I can =
single-handed move the world.
<BR>The human race is a race of cowards and I am not only marching in =
that procession, but carrying a banner.<br><A =
