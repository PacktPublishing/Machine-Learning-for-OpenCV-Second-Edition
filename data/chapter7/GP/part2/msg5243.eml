<P>FROM THE DESK OF <BR>SANI MOHAMMED,AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING =
UNIT.<BR>FOREIGN REMITTANCE =
DEPT.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=
bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>BANK OF =
AFRICA(BOA)ANNEX<BR>OUAGA-BURKINA FASO </P>
<P>I Am Mr SANI MOHAMMED,the Manager in charge of auditing and =
accounting unit foreign remittance department of BANK OF AFRICA(BOA) =
Ouaga-Burkina Faso in West Africa, with due respect and regards, I have =
decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very =
beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction.</P>
<P>During my investigation and auditing in the bank, I department came =
across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person, a =
foriegner who died in a plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his =
account with the bank without any claim of the fund in our custody =
either from his family or relation before our discovery to this =
development.</P>
<P>Although personally, I kept this information secret within myself to =
enable the whole plans and idea be profitable and successful during the =
time of execution,The amount involved is USD$30.000,000.(thirty million =
us dollars.)Meanwhile the whole arrangement and directives needed to put =
claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, will =
be forward to you upon your acceptance information will be relayed to =
you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist us =
and also benefit your self to this great business opportunity.</P>
<P>In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position =
in this country as a civil servant, we are not allowed to operate a =
foriegn account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during =
the time of transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual =
reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward =
claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of Oath to the bank =
and also present a foriegn account where he will need the money to be =
re-transferred into o<BR>n his request as it may be, after due =
verification and clarification to designated bank account.<BR>I will not =
fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free, On smoth =
conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the total =
sum as gratification, while 70% will be for me <BR>Please,you have been =
adviced to keep top secret as we are still in service and intend to =
retire from service after we conclude this deal with you.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>I =
will be monitoring the whole situation here in the bank until you =
confirm the money in your account and ask us to come down to your =
country for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages =
previously indicated and further investment,either in your country or =
any other country you may advice us to invest in.All other necessary =
information will be sent to you when I hear from you.I suggest you get =
back to me as soon as possible stating your wish in this deal.<BR>Best =
Regard<BR>MR.SANI =
MOHAMMED.<BR></P><BR>------------------------------------------<BR><BR>Fa=
