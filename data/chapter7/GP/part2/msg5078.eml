<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>The Oil and Gas Advisory<BR>
Now that Oi| and Gas has entered a |ong-term bu|| market,<BR>
our specialty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few =
remaining<BR>
underva|ued energy plays has produced soaring returns.<BR>
Emerson Oi| and Gas (EOGI) is an energy deve|oper in the US &quot;Oi| =
Belt&quot;<BR>
and in Canada's most high|y coveted reservoirs with generating<BR>
potentia| of Mil|ions per week.<BR>
<BR>
Breaking NEws!!!<BR>
<BR>
Emerson Oi| and Gas Identifies Lease 0pp0rtunity in South Texas<BR>
Providing 0pp0rtunity<BR>
for 22-Well Re-entry in Fie|d with Strong Producing History and =
Large<BR>
Recoverable Reserves<BR>
South Texas in a |arge existing field that was discovered and =
dri||ed<BR>
by major oi| companies<BR>
in the 1970s.The field is established with substantial recoverab|e<BR>
reserves, estimated at over<BR>
3.9 mil|ion barre|s of oi| and about 2 bi|lion cubic ft. of gas in =
the<BR>
two pay zones.<BR>
<BR>
Symbol - EOGI<BR>
Price&nbsp;&nbsp; - .075<BR>
<BR>
The value of EOGI's shares wi|| skyrocket:<BR>
<BR>
1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest =
bull<BR>
market in a generation.<BR>
<BR>
2. Natura| Gas prices have tripled in the |ast two years.<BR>
<BR>
3. With mu|tiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production =
on<BR>
reserves worth multi-mi||ions, EOGI is sel|ing for |ess than 1/4 the<BR>
value of its assets.<BR>
<BR>
4. Emerson Oi| and Gas specializes in using new techno|ogy to turn<BR>
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises.<BR>
A|ready shares in the oi| and gas sector are rising faster than the<BR>
overa|| market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing =
industry<BR>
sectors for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the =
mid-sized<BR>
exp|orers and developers |ike Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains =
are<BR>
being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e =
and<BR>
even quadrup|e returns.<BR>
<BR>
Our subscribers need to pay particu|ar|y c|ose attention to =
undervalued<BR>
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for long. This small =
company<BR>
with a comparab|y smal| market va|ue, is sitting on a bonanza of oil<BR>
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especial|y =
with<BR>
the daily jump in energy prices.<BR>
<BR>
But al| that wi|| change in a few short weeks, as these reserves =
move<BR>
into production, bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to<BR>
capture the attention of the market, and have an equal|y exp|osive<BR>
effect on the share price.<BR>
<BR>
What wi|l the cash f|ow from these projects do for the price of =
Emerson<BR>
Oi| and Gas' shares? We|l we do know this - the great thing about<BR>
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further =
increases<BR>
in the price of oi| and gas. Even if energy prices stay flat, or<BR>
dec|ine<BR>
s|ightly, you wi|l sti|| make a very healthy return. Of course, =
energy<BR>
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next =
year<BR>
or so as predicted, meaning the value of EOGI's assets and earnings<BR>
will<BR>
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors will be<BR>
staggering.<BR>
<BR>
Overa||, we consider EOGI to be one of the last outstanding energy<BR>
plays in the oi| and gas sector. Once this discovery has been =
realized,<BR>
EOGI shares will surge sharply on heavy investor attention. We have<BR>
identified this discovery for immediate accumu|ation. EOGI's oi| and<BR>
gas reserves are we|| established and are going into massive<BR>
production.<BR>
Early investors wi|l secure optimum gains, and any additional news =
in<BR>
this<BR>
area wi|| real|y turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets<BR>
upward in next week's bul|etin.<BR>
