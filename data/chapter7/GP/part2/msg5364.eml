<BR>People are capable of doing an awful lot when they have no choice =
and I had no choice. Courage is when you have choices.



<BR>Where there is injury let me sow pardon.
<BR>As I get older I seem to believe less and less and yet to believe =
what I do believe more and more.<BR>Earnestness is enthusiasm tempered =
by reason.<BR><BR>Life's but a day at most.<BR><BR>It is odd but =
agitation or contest of any kind gives a rebound to my spirits and sets =
me up for a time.



<BR><BR>Every violation of truth is not only a sort of suicide in the =
liar, but is a stab at the health of human society.
<BR><BR>Life's too short for chess.



<br><br>The manner of their living is very barbarous, because they do =
not eat at fixed times, but as often as they please.

<br><br>Born to be wild -- live to outgrow it.<br>Discipline is not a =
nasty word.


<br>No one would talk much in society if they knew how often they =
misunderstood others.<BR>Genius is the ability to reduce the complicated =
to the simple.
<BR><BR>More firm and sure the hand of courage strikes, when it obeys =
the watchful eye of caution.

There is no means of proving it is preferable to be than not to =
be.<br>Children have never been very good at listening to their elders, =
but they have never failed to imitate them.
<br><br>Faith is an oasis in the heart which will never be reached by =
the caravan of thinking.



<BR><BR>I wanted to be scared again... I wanted to feel unsure again. =
That's the only way I learn, the only way I feel challenged.
