completed Judaism or it is nothing.



<br><br>Yet, taught by time, my heart has learned to glow for other's =
good, and melt at other's woe.


<br><br>We are nearer loving those who hate us than those who love us =
more than we wish.<BR><BR>We own almost all our knowledge not to those =
who have agreed but to those who have differed.



<BR>If eighty percent of your sales come from twenty percent of all of =
your items, just carry those twenty percent.<br><br>When two people =
relate to each other authentically and humanly, God is the electricity =
that surges between them.



<br>Civilization must be destroyed. The hairy saints of the North have =
earned this crumb by their complaints.



<br>Dreading that climax of all human ills the inflammation of his =
weekly bills.


<BR>We may have all come on different ships, but we're in the same boat =
now.<br>Everyone is more or less mad on one point.



<BR>In any man who dies there dies with him, his first snow and kiss and =
fight. Not people die but worlds die in them.


<br><br>Most men lead lives of quiet desperation and go to the grave =
with the song still in them.



<BR>Absolute faith corrupts as absolutely as absolute power.

Man's extremity is God's opportunity.<BR><BR>Since we cannot attain unto =
it, let us revenge ourselves with railing against it.<BR>A long dispute =
means that both parties are wrong
<br><br>Love the whole world as a mother lovers her only =
child.<br><br>He enjoys true leisure who has time to improve his soul's =
estate.
