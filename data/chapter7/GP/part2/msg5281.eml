You can grab music, like full CD albums, and games &amp; movies.&nbsp; I =
saw 6 CD's I dont have yet so I grabbed those.<BR>
Once you've seen it get ahold of me, I want to hear your reaction - =
you'll go batty I know it.<BR>
Theres this awsome section of the site that shows you how to burn the =
games &amp; music and movies to CD.<BR>
I'm looking at the movie sections over lunch, they have movies in here =
that are still in theaters - it's nuts.<BR>
I'll see you next Friday at the get together.<BR>
