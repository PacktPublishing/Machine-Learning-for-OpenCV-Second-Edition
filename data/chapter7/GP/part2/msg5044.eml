      <p align=3D"left">One Biometric company (Facekey Corp) appears to =
be on the=20
      forefront of making a difference. Facekey Corp. trading on the OTC =
under=20
      the ticker symbol &quot;FEKY&quot; . Headquartered in San Antonio =
Texas, this=20
      Biometric Company combines face and fingerprint recognition =
technology=20
      which can be used in both the public and private sectors. COO =
Annette=20
      Starkweather exclaims &quot; By effectively combining both =

      facial recognition, Facekey is targeting the two largest revenue =
producing=20
      areas in the Biometrics industry today while establishing patented =

      technology to forge the future of biometric applications&quot;. =
<br>
      <br>
      According to The International Biometrics Group (IBG), an =
independent=20
      market research firm, the total biometrics market was $730 million =
in=20
      2003. Biometrics is anticipated to grow to approximately $4.8 =
billion by=20
      2008. Fingerprint technology represents $1.4 billion and Facial=20
      Recognition $802 Million of that $4.8 billion. Currently the =
Biometric=20
      industry is in its early stages of growth but we believe =
government=20
      initiatives will act as a major catalyst towards global industry =
growth.=20
      For example on January 5th of this year The U.S.-Visitor and =
Immigrant=20
      status indicator technology was implemented at 115 airports and 14 =
ship=20
      terminals, <br>
      requiring U.S. customs officials to digitally photograph and =
fingerprint=20
      visa carrying foreign nationals Data is compared against a =
government=20
      database of possible terrorists with criminal histories (Source: =
MSNBC,=20
      Roland Jones 1/20/04). The program received $330 million for the =
fiscal=20
      year 2004. <br>
      <br>
      Biometrics is also used in the battle against occupational fraud. =
Based on=20
      2004 report findings by the Association of Certified Fraud =
Examiners (ACFE)=20
      , the typical organization loses 6 percent of its annual revenues =
to=20
      occupational fraud. If multiplied by the U.S. GDP, which in 2003 =
was just=20
      under $11 trillion, it would translate into $660 billion in annual =
fraud=20
      losses. This is why Facekey through its innovative Biometric =
technologies=20
      is focusing much of its core business on fraud. Government =
initiatives are=20
      always plagued with delays due to slow or inconsistent standards =
of=20
      development, lengthy technology reviews and public comment. To =
offset that=20
      Facekey has diversified into the private sector as well, proving =
that its=20
      management team has the ability to find other niche areas where =
its=20
      technology could be used to grow both bottom and top line numbers=20
      continually. In fact in a press release issued January 18, 2004, =
Annette=20
      H. Starkweather, FaceKey Corp. COO goes on to say, ``On a recent =
trip to=20
      Las Vegas, we discovered that casinos represent a largely =
underdeveloped=20
      market that could benefit from FaceKey's biometric products. Based =
on=20
      discussions we have had with casino personnel, our multiple face =
tracking=20

current=20
      surveillance methods used by many Las Vegas casinos to screen =
their crowds=20

      <br>
      Due to an emerging global market and Facekey's ability to target =
both=20
      public and private sectors through there innovative facial and =
fingerprint=20
      recognition technologies we believe this company has the ability =
increase=20
