<BR>
Please, kindly pardon me for any inconvenience this letter may cost =
you<BR>
because I know it may come to you as a surprise as we'have no previous =
correspondence.<BR>
I got your contact as i was searching for helping hand in your country =
,<BR>
this is why I decided to appeal to you directly for assistancebecause =
I'<BR>
have no relations or friends in your country for help .<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I am Mrs Mand Johnson, from Liberia.presently,I am residing in Abidjan =
economic<BR>
capital of COTE D'IVOIRE in Weste africa, because of the political =
crisis<BR>
in my Country. I would Honestly want to seek for an immediate =
assistance<BR>
for transaction of $18.5 Million U.S dollars belonging to my late =
Husband<BR>
who was held bondage by the Rebels during the political crisis in my =
country<BR>
and was letter killed.<BR>
<BR>
I ran to COTE D'IVOIRE refugee Camp when I Discovered danger to my =
life.<BR>
This money was deposited in a Private security company here in Adbijan =
cote<BR>
d voire as a consignment recorded and deposited as family treasures =
for<BR>
security reasons.<BR>
<BR>
I have every Document regards the transaction ,I have contacted the =
security<BR>
company and confirmed the safety of the consignment, As it is, I have =
theintention<BR>
to investing the money oversees and however needed a Foreigner who is =
capable<BR>
of giving adequate assistance to me by the way of clearing the =
Consignment<BR>
from the security company and thereafter forwarding it to your Account =
Abroad<BR>
for investment. I have nice percentage of the money for you.<BR>
<BR>
If Necessary, Please do feel free to ask me questions on this as I =
wait<BR>
for your reply soonest and However, we don't really know each other, =
therefore<BR>
we need to build a strong relationship of trust first which is the =
most<BR>
important thing between any transaction on earth and with this i will =
be<BR>
very glad to abide with you.<BR>
<BR>
Thank you for reading my letter and kindly let me know if this is ok =
for<BR>
you so that we can discuss the issue, and kindly keep this message to =
yourself<BR>
