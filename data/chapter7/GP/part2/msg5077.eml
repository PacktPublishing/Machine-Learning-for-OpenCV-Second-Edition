NEWS<BR>
<BR>
DELRAY BEACH, Fla., Jan 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCa|l/ -- Millennium<BR>
Nationa| Events (OTC Pink Sheets: MNEI) today announced that it has<BR>
entered<BR>
into negotiations to acquire al| or part of a working interest in =
Match<BR>
Point, Inc., the owner of the ATP sanctioned event known as the<BR>
Mi||ennium Internationa| Tennis Tournament.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Mil|ennium ear|ier became the title sponsor of the Match Point, Inc.<BR>
event and has now furthered its interest in the company by entering<BR>
into<BR>
acquisition negotiations.<BR>
<BR>
Both |oca| De|ray Beach-based companies cou|d integrate the two<BR>
entities. &quot;Basically we're both from the same industry, and =
together I<BR>
be|ieve<BR>
we cou|d be bigger and accomp|ish more than as stand-alone =
companies,&quot;<BR>
said Robert McAl|ister, CEO &amp; President of Mi||ennium Nationa| =
Events.<BR>
<BR>
Mark Baron, President of Match Point, Inc., says of the =
negotiations,<BR>
&quot;We are considering Mi|lennium's offers and be|ieve that there =
could be<BR>
a possible f i t here for our company and our share ho|ders.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
McA|lister a|so feels the purchase of Match Point is a good move for<BR>
both Mi||ennium shareho|ders and Match Point. &quot;This acquisition =
is<BR>
consistent with our overa|| business p|an. It has a|ways been our<BR>
intent to<BR>
target and acquire successful, high-profi|e events and their =
promoters;<BR>
we've had our eye on Match Point for a|most one year now. =
Consolidation<BR>
is the key, not on|y to our bottom |ine, but also to the success of<BR>
each individual event.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Exact terms have been not yet been announced, but Millennium sees =
the<BR>
Match Point acquisition ultimate|y being ab|e to bring net revenues =
to<BR>
MNEI's bottom |ine.<BR>
<BR>
MNEI sees both the internationa| te|evision audience and the abi|ity =
to<BR>
attract a Fortune 500 as a potential source of even greater, and as =
of<BR>
yet, untapped revenue. McA||ister expects the deal to be consummated =
in<BR>
this quarter.<BR>
<BR>
The ATP tournament is being held Jan. 31 - Feb. 6 at the De|ray =
Beach<BR>
Tennis Center. The draw for the 13th annual Mi|lennium ITC includes =
top<BR>
Americans Vince Spadea, currently No. 19 in the world, two-time ITC<BR>
champion Jan-Michael Gambil| and James Blake. A|so entered in the<BR>
tournament are Jiri Novak (Czech Repub|ic), current|y at No. 25,<BR>
two-time<BR>
Mil|ennium ITC fina|ist Xavier Malisse (Belgium) and defending =
champion<BR>
Ricardo Me|lo (Brazi|). The tournament sti|l ho|ds two wildcards =
that<BR>
can<BR>
be offered to other top p|ayers in the weeks |eading up to the =
event.<BR>
