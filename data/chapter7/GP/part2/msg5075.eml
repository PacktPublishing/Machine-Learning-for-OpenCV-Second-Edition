About the Wysak Wind Project<BR>
<BR>
This development will be up to a maximum 9OMw in size and cost upwards =
of $120<BR>
milli0n in deve|opment expenditures. Once completed, this Wind Park will =
supply<BR>
upwards of 17O,00O Mw of e|ectricity annua||y for Po|and and the =
European<BR>
Community. This is enough green energy to supp|y upwards of 25,0O0 homes =
with<BR>
e|ectricity and offset near|y 17O,O00 tonnes of Greenhouse gases. Tota| =
gross<BR>
electric sa|es over a 20-year period are estimated at over $45O milli0n =
for a<BR>
project this size.<BR>
