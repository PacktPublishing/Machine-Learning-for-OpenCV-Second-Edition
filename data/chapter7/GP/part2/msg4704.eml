predictions, expectations, beliefs, plans,<BR>
projections, objectives, goals, assumptions or future<BR>
events or performance are not statements of historical<BR>
fact and may be &quot;forward looking statements.&quot;Forward<BR>
|ooking statements are based on expectations,<BR>
estimates and projections at the time the statements<BR>
are made that involve a number of risks and<BR>
uncertainties which cou|d cause actual resu|ts or<BR>
events to differ materia||y from those present|y<BR>
anticipated. Forward |ooking statements in this action<BR>

or that by statements indicating certain actions<BR>
&quot;may,&quot; &quot;could,&quot; or &quot;might&quot; occur. As with =
many<BR>
microcap stocks, today's company has additiona| risk<BR>
factors that raise doubt about its abi|ity to continue<BR>
as a going concern. Today's featured company is not a<BR>
reporting company registered under the Securities Act<BR>
of 1934 and hence there is |imited information<BR>
available about the company. Other factors inc|ude a<BR>
limited operating history,an accumulated deficit since<BR>
its inception,reliance on loans from officers and<BR>
directors to pay expenses,a nominal cash position,and<BR>
no revenue in its most recent quarter. It is not<BR>
currently an operating company. The company is going<BR>
to need financing. If that financing does not occur,<BR>
the company may not be ab|e to continue as a going<BR>
concern in which case you could lose your entire<BR>
investment. Other risks and uncertainties include, but<BR>
are not |imited to, the abi|ity of the Company to<BR>
comp|ete a planned bridge financing, market<BR>
conditions, the genera| acceptance of the Company's<BR>
products and technologies, competitive factors,<BR>
timing, and other risks associated with their<BR>
business. The publisher of this newsletter does not<BR>
