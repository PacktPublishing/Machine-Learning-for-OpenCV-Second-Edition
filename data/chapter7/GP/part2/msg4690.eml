Professor Laurie of Glasgow put this notice on his door: "Professor =
Laurie
will not meet his classes today."A student, after reading the notice, =
rubbed
out the "c". Later Professor Laurie came along, and entering into the =
spirit
of the joke, rubbed out the "l".<br>
Landon had made an unsuccessful attempt at the recitation, and the =
doctor,
somewhat nettled, said:"Landon, you don't seem to be getting on very =
fast in
this subject. You seem to lack ambition. Why, at your age Alexander the
Great had conquered half the world.""Yes," said Landon,"he couldn't help =
it,
for you will recall the fact, doctor, that Alexander the Great had =
Aristotle
for a teacher.<br>
My mother and I were standing at he check-out in the supermarket as the
cashier scanned the things we bought. When the price of a bottle of =
orange
juice was scanned as $4,, my mother said "It's only $3.95."The cashier
stopped wheat she was doing and disappeared down one of the aisles to =
check
the price. she soon returned and said that the price was $3.95. When she
handed my mother the change, a five cent coin rolled onto the floor. =
Much to
my amusement, as the cashier bent over to search for it, my mother said =
"Oh,
don't bother, it's only five cents." <br>
