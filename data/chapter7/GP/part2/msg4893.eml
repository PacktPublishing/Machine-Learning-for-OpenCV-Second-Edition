<P><FONT SIZE=2>Attn: Mr. President<BR>
<BR>
I am Dr. Collins Khumalo, Director of Project, South<BR>
Africa Ministry of Mining &amp; Natural Resources. I am<BR>
making this contact with you based on the committee's<BR>
need for an individual/company who is willing to<BR>
assist us with a solution to a money transfer. First<BR>
and foremost apologized using this medium to reach you<BR>
for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this<BR>
is due to Confidentiality and prompt access reposed on<BR>
this medium.<BR>
<BR>
In unfolding this proposal, I want to count on you, as<BR>
a respected and honest person to handle this<BR>
transaction with sincerity, trust and confidentiality.<BR>
I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation<BR>
with you in the execution of the deal described Here<BR>
under for the benefit of all parties and hope you will<BR>
keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this<BR>
transaction. Within the Ministry of Mining and Natural<BR>
resources where I work as Director of Project<BR>
Implementation and with the co-operation of four other<BR>
top officials, we have in our possession as overdue<BR>
payment bills totaling Fourteen Million, Five Hundred<BR>
Thousand United States Dollars (US$14,500,000.) which<BR>
we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and<BR>
cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive<BR>
the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign<BR>
non-company account to receive such funds.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as<BR>
the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does<BR>
not allow us to operate offshore account hence your<BR>
importance in the whole transaction. This amount<BR>
$14.5m represents the balance of the total contract<BR>
value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign<BR>
contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced<BR>
deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have<BR>
been paid to the original contractor, leaving the<BR>
balance in the tune of the said amount which we have<BR>
in principles gotten approval to remit by Key tested<BR>
Telegraphic Transfer (K.T.T) to any foreign bank<BR>
account you will provide by filing in an application<BR>
through the Ministry of Justice here in South Africa<BR>
for the transfer of rights and privileges of the<BR>
former contractor to you. I have the authority of my<BR>
partners involved to propose that should you be<BR>
willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of<BR>
the sum will be 20% of the$14.5 million, 70% for us<BR>
and 5% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses and<BR>
while balance 5% will go to charity organisation.<BR>
<BR>
The business itself is 100%safe, on your part provided<BR>
you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality.<BR>
Also your area of specialization is not a hindrance to<BR>
the successful execution of this transaction. I have<BR>
reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will<BR>
not disappoint me.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;Endeavor to contact me immediately through my e-mail<BR>
to confirm whether or not you are interested in this<BR>
deal. If you are not, it will enable me scout for<BR>
another foreign partners to carryout this deal.<BR>
<BR>
I want to assure you that my partners and myself are<BR>
in a position to make the payment of this claim<BR>
possible provided you can give us a very strong<BR>
Assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured<BR>
and please, remember to treat this matter very<BR>
confidential, because we will not comprehend with any<BR>
form of exposure as we are still in active Government<BR>
Service. Once again, remember that time is of great<BR>
essence in this transaction wait in anticipation of<BR>
your fullest co-operation.<BR>
<BR>
Yours faithfully,<BR>
Dr.Collins Khumalo.<BR>
