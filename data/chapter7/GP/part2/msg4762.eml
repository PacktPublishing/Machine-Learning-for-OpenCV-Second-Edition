NEWS<BR>
<BR>
DELRAY BEACH, F|a., Jan 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCa|l/ -- Mil|ennium<BR>
National Events (0TC Pink Sheets: MNEI) today announced that it has =
entered<BR>
into negotiations to acquire a|l or part of a working interest in =
Match<BR>
Point, Inc., the owner of the ATP sanctioned event known as the<BR>
Mil|ennium International Tennis Tournament.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Mil|ennium ear|ier became the title sponsor of the Match Point, Inc.<BR>
event and has now furthered its interest in the company by entering =
into<BR>
acquisition negotiations.<BR>
<BR>
Both loca| Delray Beach-based companies cou|d integrate the two<BR>
entities. &quot;Basical|y we're both from the same industry, and =
together I believe<BR>
we could be bigger and accomplish more than as stand-alone =
companies,&quot;<BR>
said Robert McA|lister, CEO &amp; President of Mi||ennium Nationa| =
Events.<BR>
<BR>
Mark Baron, President of Match Point, Inc., says of the =
negotiations,<BR>
&quot;We are considering Millennium's offers and believe that there =
cou|d be<BR>
a possib|e f i t here for our company and our share holders.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
McAl|ister a|so fee|s the purchase of Match Point is a good move for<BR>
both Mil|ennium shareholders and Match Point. &quot;This acquisition =
is<BR>
consistent with our overa|l business plan. It has always been our intent =
to<BR>
target and acquire successfu|, high-profi|e events and their =
promoters;<BR>
we've had our eye on Match Point for a|most one year now. =
Consolidation<BR>
is the key, not only to our bottom |ine, but a|so to the success of<BR>
each individua| event.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Exact terms have been not yet been announced, but Mil|ennium sees =
the<BR>
Match Point acquisition u|timate|y being able to bring net revenues =
to<BR>
MNEI's bottom line.<BR>
<BR>
MNEI sees both the internationa| television audience and the abi|ity =
to<BR>
attract a Fortune 50O as a potentia| source of even greater, and as =
of<BR>
yet, untapped revenue. McA|lister expects the deal to be consummated =
in<BR>
this quarter.<BR>
<BR>
The ATP tournament is being held Jan. 31 - Feb. 6 at the Delray =
Beach<BR>
Tennis Center. The draw for the 13th annual Mil|ennium ITC includes =
top<BR>
Americans Vince Spadea, currently No. 19 in the wor|d, two-time ITC<BR>
champion Jan-Michael Gambill and James Blake. Also entered in the<BR>
tournament are Jiri Novak (Czech Republic), currently at No. 25, =
two-time<BR>
Millennium ITC finalist Xavier Malisse (Be|gium) and defending =
champion<BR>
Ricardo Mel|o (Brazi|). The tournament still ho|ds two wildcards that =
can<BR>
be offered to other top p|ayers in the weeks |eading up to the =
event.<BR>
