ATTN:DEAR PRESIDENT/MD.<BR>
<BR>
With due respect, trust and humility, I use this<BR>
medium to write this letter to you irrespective of the fact that you do =
not know me, but please do consider this letter as a request from a =
family in dare need of assistance.<BR>
<BR>
Let me formally introduce myself. I am DUVE KHUMALO, the son of =
LATE.DR.ROBINSON KHUMALO, the renowned Zimbabwean Wine and Cattle Ranch =
farmer.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;I got your contact courtesy of a business journal from the South =
African Information Exchange in my earnest search for a reliable and =
trustworthy individual/company who can assist me in this business.<BR>
<BR>
During the war waged against the farmers in Zimbabwe by the supporters =
and cohorts of President Robert Mugabe to claim all the white owned =
farms in our country, my late father belonged to one of the classes of =
farmers targeted by the ZANU-PF armed group, because he did not support =
their ideas and policies.<BR>
<BR>
In the course of the revolution in the country, the ZANU-PF armed group =
attacked and invaded my father's farms burning, destroying and =
eventually killing him. After my father's death last year, I managed to =
escape the boundaries of Zimbabwe into South Africa with my mother, =
because our lives were threatened and Zimbabwe was no longer safe for =
us.<BR>
<BR>
We escaped safely into South Africa with my father's lifetime fortune of =
US$25 (TWENTY FIVE MILLION<BR>
US Dollars) cash, bonds, important documents of property title and other =
valuables, which he instructed I his son on before his death. The money =
and valuables were concealed and secured in two treasure boxes, and were =
transported to Netherlands through diplomatic means.<BR>
<BR>
The boxes are currently safely secured in the vaults of a private =
security and brokerage firm there in Netherlands.<BR>
<BR>
Presently, I am residing temporarily with my mother in Johannesburg =
pending the outcome of an appeal filed on my behalf by my attorney for =
the Department of Home Affairs to grant us political asylum.<BR>
<BR>
At the moment, I am in a dilemma on how to move this money safely out of =
Netherlands for investments. Moreover, due to Netherlands government's =
stringent monetary policies/regulations and the sensitive and volatile =
political status of the region, it would be most dangerous to attempt =
investments there as such act could jeopardize our chances.<BR>
<BR>
In recognition of your personal executive powers and investment =
opportunities that abound in your country, I solicit for your assistance =
in moving this money into your bank account for safekeeping pending our =
future arrival for investments.<BR>
<BR>
My mother and I have resolved to compensate you adequately by offering a =
brokerage commission of 20% of the money.<BR>
<BR>
We have also earmarked 5% for pre-transfer expenses we may incur in the =
course of the transaction and guarantee that any other expenses during =
the transaction are subject to refund.<BR>
<BR>
I have in mind to establish a good business and friendly relationship =
with you in the nearest future if you are able to assist us.<BR>
<BR>
Please let me receive your approval or reply through this my email =
address (khumaduve101@netscape.net)or phone number above and feel free =
to ask any questions you may consider relevant and kindly, send your =
phone and fax number for easier communication.&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
If you are unable to assist please be kind to notify me so that I can =
look for a suitable alternative.<BR>
<BR>
Please accept my warm compliments, as I earnestly wait for your urgent =
response.<BR>
<BR>
Best regard,<BR>
<BR>
