Dear Sir,<BR>
<BR>
Compliments,I barrister Davis have decided to bestow this trust on =
you,<BR>
which I pray you will not ignore or betray.I appologise in advance for =
any<BR>
inconviniences this may cause you. I am Barrister Davis Ugo the =
Personal<BR>
&nbsp;Attorney to late Mr Johnson Creek, who was a contractor&nbsp; here =
in Benin<BR>
Rep.Who, on the 3rd of Oct 2001, with his entire family were perished =
in<BR>
a fierceful&nbsp; Auto-Crash along Midombo Togo express way.As a matter =
of fact,<BR>
my client made a fixed deposit Amount, valued at (USD$10.9M)with =
Reliance<BR>
Bank here in Benin Rep, and upon the duration time of their =
agreement,his<BR>
bank started contacting him but no response. Conseqently, the bank =
issued<BR>
me a notice to provide&nbsp; the next of kin to the deceased&nbsp; as =
his personal<BR>
attorney,or have his account confiscated after four years, as it is in =
the<BR>
law of this country.<BR>
<BR>
Since then, I have made several contacts to His Countries Embassy in =
order<BR>
to locate any of my clients extended relatives,which had also been =
unsuccessful.<BR>
Since&nbsp; I have been unsuccesfull in locating&nbsp; the relatives for =
over two<BR>
years now, I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of =
the<BR>
deceased since none of his relatives were no way to be found so that =
the<BR>
proceeds of this account valued at $10.9m could be transffered into =
your<BR>
account, thereafter,we will both share it in percentage according to =
our<BR>
contributions to boost the success of this great transaction. I have =
all<BR>
the necessary legal documents that can be used to back up all the =
claims<BR>
we will make. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us =
make<BR>
this great benefiting transaction successfully.<BR>
<BR>
I guarantee&nbsp; that this will be executed under a legitimate =
arrangement that<BR>
will protect you from any breach of the law.&nbsp; Please get in touch =
with me<BR>
as fast as possible through this E-mail: barr_davis5@jumpy.it and =
through<BR>
phone also, to&nbsp; enable us discuss further the progress of this =
business.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
With best regards,<BR>
Hon:Davis Ugo Esq,<BR>
Senior advocate of Benin(SAB).<BR>
