<BR>
Dear friend,<BR>
<BR>
Permit me to inform you of my desire of going into<BR>
business relationship with you.<BR>
I am MR Andy monga , the only son of late MR and MRS<BR>
BANABAS MONGA . My father was a very wealthy cocoa<BR>
merchant in Abidjan, the economic capital of Ivory<BR>
Coast, my father was poisoned to death by his business<BR>
associates in one of their outings on a business trip.<BR>
<BR>
My mother died when I was a baby and since then, my<BR>
father took me so special. Before the death of my<BR>
father on January 2002 in a private hospital here in<BR>
Abidjan, he secretly called me on his bedside and told<BR>
me that he has the sum of eighteen million, five<BR>
hundred<BR>
thousand US dollars (US$18,500,000) left in a fixed /<BR>
suspense account in one of the prime banks here in<BR>
Abidjan, that he used my name as his only son for the<BR>
next of kin in depositing the fund. He also<BR>
explained to me that it was because of this wealth<BR>
that he was poisoned by his business associates. That<BR>
I should seek for a foreign partner in a country of my<BR>
choice where I will transfer this money and use it for<BR>
investment purpose such as real estate management or<BR>
hotel management.<BR>
<BR>
I am honourably seeking your assistance in the<BR>
following ways:<BR>
1) To serve as a guardian of this fund since I am only<BR>
20years old<BR>
2) To make arrangement for me to come over to your<BR>
country to further my education and to secure a<BR>
resident permit for me in your country.<BR>
<BR>
Moreover, I am willing to offer you 15% of the<BR>
total sum as compensation for your effort/input after<BR>
the successful transfer of this fund into your<BR>
nominated account overseas and 5% for expenses.<BR>
<BR>
Furthermore, you indicate your options towards<BR>
assisting me as I believe that this transaction would<BR>
be concluded within (24) days you signify<BR>
interest to assist me.<BR>
<BR>
Anticipating to hear from you soon.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks and God bless!<BR>
