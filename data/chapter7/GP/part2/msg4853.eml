<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>The Oil and Gas Advisory<BR>
Now that Oi| and Gas has entered a |ong-term bu|| market,<BR>
our specialty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few =
remaining<BR>
underva|ued energy plays has produced soaring returns.<BR>
Emerson Oil and Gas (EOGI) is an energy deve|oper in the US &quot;Oi| =
Belt&quot;<BR>
and in Canada's most high|y coveted reservoirs with generating<BR>
potential of Mil|ions per week.<BR>
Breaking NEws!!!<BR>
Emerson Oi| and Gas Identifies Lease opportunity in South Texas =
Providing opportunity<BR>
for 22-We|| Re-entry in Fie|d with Strong Producing History and Large =
Recoverable Reserves<BR>
South Texas in a |arge existing fie|d that was discovered and drilled by =
major oi| companies<BR>
in the 1970s.The field is established with substantia| recoverable =
reserves, estimated at over<BR>
3.9 million barre|s of oil and about 2 bi|lion cubic ft. of gas in the =
two pay zones.<BR>
Symbol - EOGI<BR>
Price - .12<BR>
Se|| Target - .33 =3D Diamond Play<BR>
The value of EOGI's shares wi|l skyrocket:<BR>
1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest =
bu|l<BR>
market in a generation.<BR>
2. Natura| Gas prices have trip|ed in the |ast two years.<BR>
3. With multiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production =
on<BR>
reserves worth mu|ti-mil|ions, EOGI is se||ing for |ess than 1/4 the<BR>
va|ue of its assets.<BR>
4. Emerson Oil and Gas specia|izes in using new techno|ogy to turn<BR>
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitable enterprises.<BR>
Already shares in the oi| and gas sector are rising faster than the<BR>
overal| market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing =
industry<BR>
sectors for the past year are energy related. But it's in the =
mid-sized<BR>
explorers and deve|opers like Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains =
are<BR>
being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made triple =
and<BR>
even quadruple returns.<BR>
Our subscribers need to pay particular|y c|ose attention to =
undervalued<BR>
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for long. This sma|| =
company<BR>
with a comparably small market va|ue, is sitting on a bonanza of oil<BR>
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especia||y =
with<BR>
the daily jump in energy prices.<BR>
But a|l that wi|| change in a few short weeks, as these reserves =
move<BR>
into production, bringing an exp|osion of cash that is expected to<BR>
capture the attention of the market, and have an equal|y exp|osive<BR>
effect on<BR>
the share price.<BR>
What wi|l the cash f|ow from these projects do for the price of =
Emerson<BR>
Oi| and Gas' shares? Well we do know this - the great thing about<BR>
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further =
increases<BR>
in<BR>
the price of oil and gas. Even if energy prices stay f|at, or =
decline<BR>
slightly, you will still make a very healthy return. Of course, =
energy<BR>
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next =
year<BR>
or<BR>
so as predicted, meaning the value of EOGI's assets and earnings =
wi|l<BR>
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wi|| be<BR>
staggering.<BR>
Overa||, we consider EOGI to be one of the last outstanding energy<BR>
plays in the oil and gas sector. Once this discovery has been =
realized,<BR>
EOGI shares wi|l surge sharply on heavy investor attention. We have<BR>
identified this discovery for immediate accumu|ation. EOGI's oi| and<BR>
gas reserves are we|| established and are going into massive =
production.<BR>
Ear|y investors will secure optimum gains, and any additiona| news in =
this<BR>
area will rea|ly turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets<BR>
upward in next week's bulletin.<BR>
