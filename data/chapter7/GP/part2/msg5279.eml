<BR><BR>The idea of strictly minding our own business is moldy rubbish. =
Who could be so selfish?Your friend is your field which you sow with =
love and reap with thanksgiving.
<BR><BR>Sometimes I wish I weren't famous.The purpose of life is to be =
defeated by greater and greater things

<br>Happiness is a ball after which we run wherever it rolls, and we =
push it with our feet when it stops.


<BR><BR>Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child but the rod of =
correction shall drive it far from him. [Proverbs 22:15]



<br><br>My mother loved children -- she would have given anything if I =
had been one.



<br><br>Holiness, not happiness, is the chief end of man.
I did send to you for certain sums of gold, which you denied =
me.<br><br>I'm comfortable being old... being black... being Jewish.=0D
<br><br>Life's enchanted cup sparkles near the brim.



<br>In every pang that rends the heart the Man of Sorrows has a part.



<BR>By asking for the impossible we obtain the best possible.Where thou =
art, that is home.



The best ballplayer's the one who doesn't think he made good. He keeps =
trying to convince you.
<br>The surrounding that householders crave are glorified =
autobiographies.



<br>Business conventions are important because they demonstrate how many =
people a company can operate without.


To know the will of God is the greatest knowledge! To do the will of God =
is the greatest achievement.<BR><BR><A =
