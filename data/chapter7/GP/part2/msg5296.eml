<br>A man who lives right, and is right, has more power in his silence =
than another has by his words.<BR><BR>The heart always sees before than =
the head can see.<BR><BR>My divorce came to me as a complete surprise. =
That's what happens when you haven't been home in eighteen years.

<BR><BR>The blood of Jesus Christ can cover a multitude of sins, it =
seems to me.



<br>A man must eat a peck of salt with his friend, before he knows him.


<BR>Wherever man goes to dwell his character goes with him.<br>Kindness =
is loving people more than they deserve.



<br>To be one's own master is to be the slave of self.
<br><br>Both men and women are fallible. The difference is, women know =
it.<BR>Things have never been more like the way they are today in =
history.

<BR>Cats seem to go on the principle that it never does any harm to ask =
for what you want.

<BR>If your energy is as boundless as your ambition, total commitment =
may be a way of life you should seriously consider.

<br>Curses are like chickens, they always come home.



<br>Too often when give children answers to remember rather than =
problems to solve.
Now he is a statesman, when what he really wants is to be what most =
reporters are, adult delinquents.

<BR><BR>Heaven for climate, Hell for company.



<br>No great artist ever sees things as they really are, if he did he =
would cease to be an artist.

<BR><BR>Do not anticipate trouble, or worry about what may never happen. =
Keep in the sunlight.<br><br><A =
