<br><br>Stands the Church clock at ten to three? And is there honey =
still for tea?
<br><br>It is hard to feel individually responsible with respect to the =
invisible processes of a huge and distant government.



<BR>Imaginary evils soon become real one by indulging our reflections on =
them.
<BR>our day will come is another way of saying you get yours.



I have no ambition to govern men. It is a painful and thankless =
office=0D



<br>Sooner or later, those who win are those who think they can.



<br>Failure -- The man who can tell others what to do and how to do it, =
but never does it himself.

<br>Wise men don't need advice. Fools won't take it.<br>Hold your head =
high, stick your chest out. You can make it. It gets dark sometimes, but =
morning comes. Keep hope alive.



<BR><BR>Don't cross the bridge till you come to it.My best friend is the =
one who brings out the best in me.<br>Trust not to much to appearances.


The most dangerous food to eat is a wedding cake.
<BR><BR>Let death be daily before your eyes, and you will never =
entertain any abject thought, nor too eagerly covet anything.



<br><br>The biggest things are often the easiest to do because there is =
so little competition.<BR><BR>I speak Spanish to God, Italian to women, =
French to men and German to my horse.<BR>Putting off an easy thing makes =
it hard, and putting off a hard one makes it impossible.


<br>Whenever nature leaves a hole in a person's mind, she generally =
plasters it over with a thick coat of self-conceit.
