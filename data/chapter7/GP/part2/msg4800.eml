A customer sent an order to a distributor for a large amount of =
goods<BR>
totaling a great deal of money. The distributor, noted that the =
previous<BR>
bill hadn't been paid. The collections manager left a voice-mail for =
them<BR>
saying &quot;We can't ship your new order until you pay for the last =
one.&quot;The<BR>
next day the collections manager received a collect phone call =
&quot;Please<BR>
cancel the order.&nbsp; We can't wait that long.&quot;<BR>
A young executive was leaving the office of a major corporation late =
one<BR>
evening when he found the CEO himself standing in front of a shredder =
with a<BR>
piece of paper in his hand. Eager to make a good impression, the young =
exec<BR>
introduced himself and asked if he could be of any help. &quot;Why =
yes,&quot; said the<BR>
CEO, holding up the piece of paper. &quot;This is a very sensitive and =
important<BR>
document, and my secretary has gone for the night. Can you make this =
thing<BR>
work?&quot; &quot;Certainly,&quot; said the young executive, happy for a =
chance to help the<BR>
boss. The young man turned the machine on, inserted the paper, and =
pressed<BR>
the start button. &quot;Excellent, excellent!&quot; said the CEO as his =
paper<BR>
disappeared inside the machine. &quot;I'll need two copies.&quot;<BR>
