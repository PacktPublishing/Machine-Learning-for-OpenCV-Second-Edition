<br>One chops the wood, the other does the grunting.



<BR>We wish to be happier than other people and this is difficult, for =
we believe others to be happier than they are.<BR><BR>Claret is the =
liquor for boys port for men but he who aspires to be a hero must drink =
brandy.<br>Winners must learn to relish change with the same enthusiasm =
and energy that we have resisted it in the past.<br>To confess a fault =
freely is the next thing to being innocent of it.



<BR><BR>Communism has never come to power in a country that was not =
disrupted by war or corruption, or both.



The first farmer was the first man. All historic nobility rests on the =
possession and use of land.

<br><br>One's real life is so often the life that one does not lead.



<BR><BR>We will burn that bridge when we come to it.Life has a practice =
of living you, if you don't live it.



<br>Old age has deformities enough of its own. It should never add to =

<br>Beauty is the index of a larger fact than wisdom.<BR><BR>Pictures =

Union.<BR><BR>He was inordinately proud of England and he abused her =
incessantly.



<BR><BR>The glory of young men is their strength, and the beauty of old =
men is their gray head.<br>Grace is but glory begun, and glory is but =
grace perfected.<BR><BR>In life, as in football, you won't go far unless =
you know where the goalposts are.



<br>I've learned that something constructive comes from every defeat.
