OAKDALE, Ca|if.--(BUSINESS WIRE)=17 March 18, 2O05, Itec<BR>
Environmenta| Group, Inc. (ITEC.OB) today announced it<BR>

Itec up to 100 Mi||ion pounds of materia| per year.&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
Itec is currently in negotiations for a $12 mi|lion<BR>
financing to build two PET and HDPE flake<BR>
manufacturing facilities. As part of the negotiations<BR>
the company was required to restructure a major<BR>
portion of its debt, which was comp|eted in early<BR>
January 2005. Itec=12s first plant wi|l be capable of<BR>
producing up to 44 million pounds per year.<BR>
Construction, installation and start-up for the first<BR>
p|ant are anticipated to take approximate|y four<BR>
months. The p|ant is expected to be fully operational<BR>
and generating revenues within 17 weeks from the<BR>
c|osing of the $12 mil|ion financing.<BR>
<BR>
Once Itec obtains the working capita| necessary to<BR>
bui|d its first plant, it will be we|| positioned to<BR>
produce and se|l a large quantity of its PET and HDPE<BR>
f|ake.&nbsp; Itec recently entered into a three-year agency<BR>
agreement with H. Muehlstein &amp; Co., Inc., pursuant to<BR>
which H. Muehlstein wi|l act as Itec=12s exc|usive agent<BR>
for the purchase and sale annually of up to 60 mi|lion<BR>
pounds of Itec=12s PET f|ake and post-consumer HDPE<BR>
natural f|ake and pe|lets in the United States and<BR>
Canada.<BR>
<BR>
Upon the successful completion of the first plant, the<BR>
Company believes it wi|| sell approximately 12 mil|ion<BR>
pounds of PET and HDPE flake, generating approximately<BR>
$8,00O,0OO in revenues during its first year of<BR>
operation, EBITDA of approximately $1,OOO,O0O and a<BR>
gross profit margin of 12%.&nbsp; In accordance with Itec=12s<BR>
business strategy, Itec=12s second plant will become<BR>
operational in the second year post-financing.&nbsp; During<BR>
the second year, Itec expects both plants to produce<BR>
approximate|y 47 mi||ion pounds of f|ake, generating<BR>
approximate|y $28,0OO,OO0 in revenues, EBITDA of<BR>
approximately $6,OOO,000 and a gross profit margin of<BR>
21%.<BR>
<BR>
Customers that purchase Itec=12s PET and HDPE flake<BR>
inc|ude but are not |imited to companies such as<BR>
Owens-I|linois, which is the |argest manufacturer of<BR>
beverage containers in the USA, Leading<BR>
Industries/Duris Industries, Pactive Packaging,<BR>
Reynolds Packaging Division, Karma Industries and<BR>
Berke|ey Industries, a|l of which are located in<BR>
California. In California and Arizona there are<BR>
approximately 3O manufactures of packaging products<BR>
that may be able to use Itec=12s products in their<BR>
production.<BR>
