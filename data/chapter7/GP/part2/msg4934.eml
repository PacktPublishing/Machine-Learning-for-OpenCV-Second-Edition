A pipe burst in a lawyer's house, so he called a plumber.  The plumber
arrived, unpacked his tools, did mysterious plumber-type things for a =
while,
and handed the lawyer a bill for $600.The lawyer exclaimed, "This is
ridiculous! I don't even make that much as a lawyer!."The plumber =
quietly
replied, "Neither did I when I was a lawyer."<br>
A mother was preparing pancakes for her sons, Kevin, 5, Ryan, 3.  The =
boys=20
began to argue over who would get the first pancake.  Their mother saw =
the
opportunity for a moral lesson.  "If Jesus were sitting here, He would =
say=20
'Let my brother have the first pancake, I can wait.'Kevin turned to his
younger brother and said, "Ryan, you be Jesus!"<br>
The first grade class gathered around the teacher for a game of "Guess =
the
Animal." The first picture the teacher held up was of a cat. "Okay boys =
and
girls," she said brightly, "can anyone tell me what this is?""I know, I
know, it's a cat!" yelled a little boy. "Very good Eddie. Now, who knows
what this animal is called?" "That's a dog!" piped up the same little =
boy.
"Right again. And what animal is this?" she asked, holding up a picture =
of a
deer. Silence fell over the class. After a minute or two, the teacher =
said,
"I'll give you a hint, children...it's something your mother calls your
father." <br>
