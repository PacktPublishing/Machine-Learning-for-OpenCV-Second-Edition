The Company<BR>
12 to 20 Plus, Inc. (OTCBB: TTTP) is a late stage development company =
that produces and<BR>
markets (through its Neurochemical Research Group division) highly =
effective<BR>
condition-specific supplements, often referred to as =
neutraceuticals.<BR>
<BR>
The products, manufactured by FDA-approved labs, contain a sophisticated =
combination of<BR>
extensively researched nutritional elements and do not contain herbs. =
Retail sales in the<BR>
explosive dietary supplement market are expected to hit $40 billion by =
the year 2007,<BR>
according to Frost &amp; Sullivan reports.<BR>
Marketing research, product development, Beta testing and various =
mergers and acquisitions<BR>
in 2003, has now positioned 12 to 20 Plus (TTTP) to roll out its full =
product line<BR>
consisting of 7 products of which they have their own proprietary =
formula, into the<BR>
multi-billion dollar Over the Counter (OTC) market. 12 To 20 Plus is =
ready to capitalize<BR>
on its exceptional product line.<BR>
Key Facts about 12 to 20 Plus Inc<BR>
<BR>
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have introduced 9 products to =
the market that the company owns the proprietary<BR>
&nbsp;rights to,&nbsp; products that have been produced in FDA approved =
labs.<BR>
<BR>
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of their products Anaplex =
(antidepressant) is currently being sold and distributed<BR>
&nbsp;in Longs Drug Stores, one of America&#146;s leading drug stores =
with over 400 stores<BR>
<BR>

with two major distributors in Europe for their<BR>
healthcare products.<BR>
<BR>

attempting to market one their newest products a<BR>
&nbsp;revolutionary re-hydration product to the U.S Military and to =
allied forces overseas.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The Industry<BR>
The neutraceutical sector has experienced some great growth over the =
past five years,<BR>
being capped off in 2002 when revenues for the global nutrition markets =
hit $160 billion.<BR>
United States took responsibility for about 1/3 of that, with $56.5 =
billion, 18.5 coming<BR>
from the nutrition markets, $19.8 from functional foods, and $4.4 =
billion from personal<BR>
care products. It&#146;s safe to say that globally we are looking for =
new ways to live<BR>
healthier and longer lives, and that pharmaceutical remedies could =
quickly be a thing of<BR>
the past.<BR>
<BR>
It&#146;s estimated that 95% of medical doctors` practices entail =
writing pharmaceutical<BR>
prescriptions and that 50% of these prescriptions are to treat the side =
effects of<BR>
medications being utilized to treat the specific ailment.<BR>
People are no longer neglecting the facts that what they are putting =
into their bodies,<BR>
may not be good for them, medicinal foods or &quot;nutritionally high =
powered foods&quot; have been<BR>
in the natural products industry for a long time and through emerging =
scientific research<BR>
the public interest has the reached the mainstream.<BR>
<BR>
It seems as though everywhere you look these days the talk is on dieting =
whether it be the<BR>
low carbohydrate/high protein Atkins diet, The Zone diet, or any of the =
other millions of<BR>
options we have, the world is concerned with weight. According to the =
American Obesity<BR>
Association, of adults over the age of 20 in the United States 127 =
million are overweight,<BR>
60 million are obese, and 9 million are severely obese. Obesity =
increases the risk of<BR>
illness from 30 serious medical conditions. This fact is forcing many of =
the snack food<BR>
and soft drink companies to come up with new healthier products that =
meet the taste<BR>
standards of today&#146;s consumers.<BR>
