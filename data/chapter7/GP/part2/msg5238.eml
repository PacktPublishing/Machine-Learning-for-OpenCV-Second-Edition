Dear Friend,<BR>
<BR>
As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for<BR>
me, because, I believe everyone will die someday.<BR>
My name is MR Hassan AL Mohammed a Crude Oil merchant in<BR>
Kuwait,i have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer .<BR>
It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and<BR>
right now I have only about a few months to live,<BR>
according to medical experts.<BR>
I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I<BR>
never really cared for anyone(not even myself)but my<BR>
business. Though I am very rich, I was never<BR>
generous, I was always hostile to people and only<BR>
focused on my business as that was the only thing I<BR>
cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know<BR>
that there is more to life than just wanting to have<BR>
or make all the money in the world.<BR>
I believe when God gives me a second chance to come<BR>
to this world I would live my life a different way<BR>
from how I have lived it. Now that God has called<BR>
me, I have willed and given most of my property<BR>
and assets to my immediate and extended family<BR>
members as well as a few close friends.<BR>
I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul<BR>
so, I have decided to give alms to charity<BR>
organizations, as I want this to be one of the last<BR>
good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed<BR>
money to some charity organizations in Austra, cameroun,<BR>
liberia,Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has<BR>
deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself<BR>
anymore. I once asked members of my family to close<BR>
one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have<BR>
there to charity organization in Bulgaria and<BR>
Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to<BR>
themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as<BR>
they seem not to be contended with what I have left<BR>
for them.<BR>
<BR>
The last of my money which no one knows of is the<BR>
huge cash deposit of fifteen million dollars<BR>
$19,000,000,00 that I have with a finance/Security<BR>
Company abroad. I will want you to help me collect this<BR>
deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I have set aside 10% for you and for your time.<BR>
<BR>
God be with you.<BR>
<BR>
