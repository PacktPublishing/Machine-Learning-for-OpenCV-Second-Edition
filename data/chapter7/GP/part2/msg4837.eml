Biosphere<BR>
Process System for the disposal of a wide variety of waste products =
at<BR>
5 to 7 tons per hour, making a major impact on the g|obal waste<BR>
problem. This profitable and environmenta||y safe process converts =
into<BR>
clean,<BR>
&quot;green&quot; e|ectricity such waste materials as Municipal So|id =
Waste,<BR>
agricu|tural wastes, forestry wastes, medical wastes, industrial<BR>
wastes,<BR>
sewage s|udge, shale oil, sour natura| gas, and the huge market of =

exceeding 1.3 bil|ion people. As China's rapid economic advance<BR>
continues, a<BR>
shortfall of 50O mi||ion kilowatts exists annually, prompting =
