Watches, clocks and alarm clocks manufactured in Switzerland bear the =
designation -Swiss made- (or its abbreviation &quot;Swiss&quot;) as well =
as the logo of the producer or distributor. This label enjoys a solid =
reputation throughout the world.<BR>
<BR>
What lies behind this reputation<BR>
What does a label like this mean for the consumer<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Swiss made&quot; embodies a concept of quality that has been =
forged over the years. It includes the technical quality of watches =
(accuracy, reliability, water-resistance and shock-resistance), as well =
as their aesthetic quality (elegance and originality of design). It =
covers both traditional manufacturing and new technologies =
(micro-electronics).<BR>
<BR>
The Swiss are not the only watchmakers to manufacture high-quality =
timepieces and are consequently faced with strong competition. However, =
thanks to their unique infrastructure and to their know-how and spirit =
of innovation, they have succeeded in maintaining their leading =
position.<BR>
<BR>
The intrinsic value of the &quot;Swiss made&quot; label, therefore, is =
the result of considerable efforts on the part of watchmaking companies, =
who are ultimately responsible for maintaining its reputation.<BR>
