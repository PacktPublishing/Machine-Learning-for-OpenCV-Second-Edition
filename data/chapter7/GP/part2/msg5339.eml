A fourth twocomponent system SrrAB recently identified by our group 18 =
and others 19 was found to inhibit RNAIII expression and may itself be =
repressed by agr. Mutants of srrAB are unable to grow normally under =
anaerobic conditions 18 19 and expression of srrAB was shown to regulate =
genes involved in energy metabolism 19.<BR>

Immunocompromised patients are the most likely to gain from enhanced =
bactericidal activity possibly offered by&nbsp; lactamaminoglycoside =
combination therapy 9 In a comparison of&nbsp; lactam monotherapy =
with&nbsp; lactamaminoglycoside combination therapy restricted to =
patients with neutropenia we found no advantage to combination treatment =

The Kingdom of Fife (that royal province) may be observed by the curious =
on the map, occupying a tongue of land between the firths of Forth and =
Tay. It may be continually seen from many parts of Edinburgh (among the =
rest, from the windows of my father's house) dying away into the =
distance and the easterly HAAR with one smoky seaside town beyond =
another, or in winter printing on the gray heaven some glittering =
hill-tops. It has no beauty to recommend it, being a low, sea-salted, =
wind-vexed promontory; trees very rare, except (as common on the east =
coast) along the dens of rivers; the fields well cultivated, I =
understand, but not lovely to the eye. It is of the coast I speak: the =
interior may be the garden of Eden. History broods over that part of the =
world like the easterly HAAR. Even on the map, its long row of Gaelic =
place- names bear testimony to an old and settled race. Of these little =
towns, posted along the shore as close as sedges, each with its bit of =
harbour, its old weather-beaten church or public building, its flavour =
of decayed prosperity and decaying fish, not one but has its legend, =
quaint or tragic: Dunfermline, in whose royal towers the king may be =
still observed (in the ballad) drinking the blood- red wine; somnolent =
Inverkeithing, once the quarantine of Leith; Aberdour, hard by the =
monastic islet of Inchcolm, hard by Donibristle where the &quot;bonny =
face was spoiled&quot;; Burntisland where, when Paul Jones was off the =
coast, the Reverend Mr. Shirra had a table carried between tidemarks, =
and publicly prayed against the rover at the pitch of his voice and his =
broad lowland dialect; Kinghorn, where Alexander &quot;brak's =
neckbane&quot; and left Scotland to the English wars; Kirkcaldy, where =
the witches once prevailed extremely and sank tall ships and honest =
mariners in the North Sea; Dysart, famous - well famous at least to me =
for the Dutch ships that lay in its harbour, painted like toys and with =
pots of flowers and cages of song-birds in the cabin windows, and for =
one particular Dutch skipper who would sit all day in slippers on the =
break of the poop, smoking a long German pipe; Wemyss (pronounce Weems) =
with its bat-haunted caves, where the Chevalier Johnstone, on his flight =
from Culloden, passed a night of superstitious terrors; Leven, a bald, =
quite modern place, sacred to summer visitors, whence there has gone but =
yesterday the tall figure and the white locks of the last Englishman in =
Delhi, my uncle Dr. Balfour, who was still walking his hospital rounds, =
while the troopers from Meerut clattered and cried &quot;Deen Deen&quot; =
along the streets of the imperial city, and Willoughby mustered his =
handful of heroes at the magazine, and the nameless brave one in the =
telegraph office was perhaps already fingering his last despatch; and =
just a little beyond Leven, Largo Law and the smoke of Largo town =
mounting about its feet, the town of Alexander Selkirk, better known =
under the name of Robinson Crusoe. So on, the list might be pursued =
(only for private reasons, which the reader will shortly have df to =
guess) by St. Monance, and Pittenweem, and the two Anstruthers, and =
Cellardyke, and Crail, where Primate Sharpe was once a humble and =
innocent country minister: on to the heel of the land, to Fife Ness, =
overlooked by a sea-wood of matted elders and the quaint old mansion of =
Balcomie, itself overlooking but the breach or the quiescence of the =
deep - the Carr Rock beacon rising close in front, and as night draws =
in, the star of the Inchcape reef springing up on the one hand, and the =
star of the May Island on the other, and farther off yet a third and a =
greater on the craggy foreland of St. Abb's. And but a little way round =
the corner of the land, imminent itself above the sea, stands the gem of =
the province and the light of mediaeval Scotland, St. Andrews, where the =
great Cardinal Beaton held garrison against the world, and the second of =
the name and title perished (as you may read in Knox's jeering =
narrative) under the knives of true-blue Protestants, and to this day =
(after so many centuries) the current voice of the professor i<BR>
