<BR>
My name is Mr Marianito Dalida,I am memberof Independent Committee =
of<BR>
Eminent Persons (ICEP), Switzerland.<BR>
<BR>
ICEP is charged with the responsibility of finding bank accounts in<BR>
Switzerland belonging to non-Swiss indigenes,which have remained =
dormant<BR>
since World War II. It may interest you to know that in July of =
1997,<BR>
the Swiss Banker's Association published a list of dormant accounts<BR>
originally opened by non-Swiss citizens.<BR>
<BR>
These accounts had been dormant since the end of World War II (May =
9,<BR>
1945). Most belonged to Holocaust victims.<BR>
<BR>
The continuing efforts of the Independent Committee of Eminent =
Persons<BR>
(ICEP) have since resulted in the discovery of additional dormant<BR>
accounts -54,000 in December, 1999. The published lists contain all<BR>
types of dormant accounts, including interest-bearing savings =
accounts,<BR>
<BR>
securities accounts, safe deposit boxes, custody accounts, and<BR>
non-interest-bearing transaction accounts.<BR>
<BR>
Numbered accounts are also included. Interest is paid on accounts =
that<BR>
were interest bearing when established.<BR>
<BR>
The Claims Resolution Tribunal (CRT) handles processing of all =
claims<BR>
on accounts due non-Swiss citizens. A dormant account of ORDNER =
ADELE<BR>
with a credit balance of 45,000,000 US dollar plus accumulated =
interest<BR>
<BR>
was discovered by me. The beneficiary was murdered during the =
holocaust<BR>
<BR>
era, leaving no WILL and no possible records for trace of theirs. =
The<BR>
Claims Resolution Tribunal has been mandated to report all unclaimed<BR>
funds for permanent closure of accounts and transfer of existing =
credit<BR>
<BR>
balance into the treasury of Switzerland government as provided by =
the<BR>
law for management of assets of deceased beneficiaries who died<BR>
interstate living no wills).<BR>
<BR>
Being a top executive at ICEP, I have all secret details and =
necessary<BR>
contacts for claim of the funds without any hitch. The funds will be<BR>
banked in the Holland,London or Spain, being a safe for funds and we =
can<BR>
share<BR>
the funds and use in investment of our choice. Due to the sensitive<BR>
nature of my job, I need a foreigner to HELP claim the funds. All =
that<BR>
is required is for you to provide me with your details for processing =
of<BR>
<BR>
the necessary legal and administrative claim documents for transfer =
of<BR>
the funds to you.<BR>
<BR>
Kindly provide me with your full name, address, and telephone/fax. I<BR>
will pay all required fees to ensure that the fund is transferred to =
a<BR>
secure, numbered account in your name in the Holland,London or =
spain,of<BR>
<BR>
which you will be capable of accessing the funds gradually and =
transferring<BR>
<BR>
to your country and other banks of choice in the world. My share will =
be<BR>
60 percent and your share is 40 per cent of the total amount. THERE =
IS<BR>
NO RISK INVOLVED. You can find additional information about =
unclaimed<BR>
funds through the internet at the following websites:<BR>

<BR>
The Holocaust Claims Processing Office has put funds in Escrow =
awaiting<BR>
<BR>
submission of valid claims for necessary disbursement, I find myself<BR>
privileged to have this information and this may be a great =
opportunity<BR>
<BR>
for a life time of success without risks.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Thanking you in anticipation for your prompt response.<BR>
