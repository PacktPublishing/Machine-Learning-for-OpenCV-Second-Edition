<br><br>The most important thing about goals is having one.


<BR><BR>All charming people, I fancy, are spoiled. It is the secret of =
their attraction.



<BR>No man can be a pure specialist without being in the strict sense an =
idiot.<br><br>Correspondences are like small clothes before the =
invention of suspenders it is impossible to keep them up.



<BR><BR>A pound of pluck is worth a ton of luck.<BR><BR>Everybody, soon =
or late, sits down to a banquet of consequences.



<BR>Fear is met and destroyed with courage.<BR><BR>The timid are afraid =
before the danger, the cowardly while in danger, and the courageous =
after danger.



<br><br>I don't want to achieve immortality through my work. I want to =
achieve it through not dying.<BR>A Christian is a man who feels =
repentance on Sunday for what he did on Saturday and is going to do on =
Monday.<br>Nothing is more fatal to health than an over care of =
it.<BR><BR>You can't expect a person to see eye to eye with you when =
you're looking down on him.

<br>It is strange that we do not temper our resentment of criticism with =
a thought for our many faults which have escaped us.

<BR><BR>Ideas can be life-changing. Sometimes all you need to open the =
door is just one more good idea.<BR>Cocaine is God's way of saying =
you're making too much money.<br>You must not fight too often with one =
enemy, or you will teach him all your tricks of war.<br>The best thing =
about the future is that it comes only one day at a time.
<br><br>America did not invent human rights. In a very real sense... =
human rights invented America.
