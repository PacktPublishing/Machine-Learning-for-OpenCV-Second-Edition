HELP<BR>
<BR>
Attn :Director / CEO,<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;My name is james Swaa, the elder son of Mr. Swaa Bongani of =
Zimbabwe. This might be a surprise to you about where I got your contact =
address. I got your address from the South African Chamber of Commerce =
in Johannesburg, South Africa.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;During the current war against the farmers in Zimbabwe from the =
supports of our President Robert Mugabe to claim all the white-owned =
farms to his party members and his followers, he ordered all white =
farmers to surrender all their farms to his party members and his =
followers.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;My father is one of the best farmers in our country and because he =
did not support Mugabe's ideas, Mugabe's supporters invaded my father's =
farm and burnt everything in the farm, killing my father and made away =
with a lot of items in my father's farm.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;Before his death, my father had deposited with one of the Security =
Company in Johannesburg, South Africa the sum of US$14.6 Million =
(Fourteen Million Six Hundred Thousand United States Dollars).with my =
name,and made every documents with my name both the certificate of =
depositry.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;Then after the death of my father, we decided to move to the =
Republic of South Africa where he had deposited the money in the =
Security Company as valuables.<BR>
&nbsp;So,I decided to contact you to assist me to transfer this money =
out of South Africa because as asylum seekers we are not allowed to =
operate any bank account within South Africa.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;We have agreed to offer you 20% of the total sum for your =
assistance, 10% will be mapped out for any expenses that may be incurred =
in the course of this transaction and 70% will be for me and my family =
to invest in your country.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;All I want you to do is to furnish me with your full personal =
phone and fax numbers for easy communication, and try to contact me =
immediately through my private E_mail: (mr_jswaa@mail.com) or above =
Telephone number.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;Note that this transaction is 100% risk free and absolutely =
confidential.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks and God bless.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;Best Regards,<BR>
Mr. James swaa,<BR>
(For The family).<BR>
