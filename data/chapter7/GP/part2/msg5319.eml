help someone.
<br><br>Sweet are the uses of adversity which, like the toad, ugly and =
venomous, wears yet a precious jewel in his head.<br>In the fight =
between you and the world, back the world.<br><br>What is conservatism? =
It is not adherence to the old and tried, but against the new and =
untried?
<br>I really lack the words to compliment myself today.<br>Caution is =
the confidential agent of selfishness.



I have eyes like those of a dead pig.I would rather belong to a poor =
nation that was free than to a rich nation that had ceased to be in love =
with liberty.Any experience can be transformed into something of =
value.<br>You can give without loving, but you cannot love without =
giving.



<br><br>Friends are like melons shall I tell you why? To find one good =
you must one hundred try.


<br><br>It is easy to perform a good action, but not easy to acquire a =
settled habit of performing such actions.<br>Only that thing is free =
which exists by the necessities of its own nature, and is determined in =
its actions by itself alone.



<BR><BR>It's a mining town in lotus land.<BR>Thank Heaven, the sun has =
gone in, and I don't have to go out and enjoy it.
There is no duty we so much underrated as the duty of being =
happy.<BR><BR>Live on doubts it becomes madness or stops entirely as =
soon as we pass from doubt to certainty.



<br><br>It is necessary to be slightly under employed if you are to do =
something significant.
