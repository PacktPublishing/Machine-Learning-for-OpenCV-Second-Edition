<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Dear Friend,<BR>
You may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not<BR>
<BR>
know me personally. The purpose of my introduction is that I am Blossom =
Makenbi,<BR>
the first daughter of Zuma Makenbi one of the most popular black farmer =
in<BR>
Zimbabwe who was recently murdered in the land dispute in my country. =
I<BR>
got your contact through network online hence decided to write you.<BR>
Before the death of my father, he had taken me to Johannesburg to<BR>
deposit the sum of USD$9.5 million (Nine million, Five Hundred thousand =
United States dollars)<BR>
in one of the private security company, as he foresaw the looming danger =
in Zimbabwe this money<BR>
was deposited in a box as gem stones to avoid much demurrage from =
security<BR>
company. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and<BR>
=3Demicals for the Farms and establishment of new farms in =
Swaziland.<BR>
<BR>
This land problem came when Zimbabwean President Mr. Robert Mugabe<BR>
introduced a new Land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white =
farmers<BR>
&nbsp;and some few black farmers, and this resulted to the killing and =
mob<BR>
action by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in<BR>
the society. In fact a lot of people were killed because of this =
Land<BR>
reform Act for which my father was one of the victims.<BR>
It is against this background that, I and my family fled Zimbabwe =
for<BR>
fear of our lives and are currently staying in the Netherlands where =
we<BR>
are seeking political asylum and moreso have decided to transfer my<BR>
=FAthers money to a more reliable foreign account. since the law of<BR>
Netherlands prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank<BR>
account or to be involved in any financial transaction throughout =
the<BR>
territorial zone of Netherlands, As the eldest daughter of my father, I =
am<BR>
saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account<BR>
where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my<BR>
government who are bent on taking everything we have got. The South<BR>
=AFrican government seems to be playing along with them.<BR>
I am faced with the dilemma of moving this amount of money out of =
South<BR>
Africa for fear of going through the same experience in future, both<BR>
<BR>
countries have similar political history. As a business minded lady,I =
am<BR>
seeking for a partner who I have to entrust my future and that of my<BR>
<BR>
family in his hands, I must let you know that this transaction is =
risk<BR>
free. If you accept to assist me and my family, all I want you to do =
for<BR>
&nbsp;me, is to make an arrangements with the security company to clear =
the<BR>
consignment(funds) from their afiliate office here in the Netherlands =
as<BR>
&nbsp;i have already given directives for the consignment to be brought =
to<BR>
the Netherlands from South Africa.But before then all modalities =
will<BR>
have to be put in place like change of ownership to the consignment =
and<BR>
more importantly this money I intend to use for<BR>
investment.<BR>
I have two options for you. Firstly you can choose to have certain<BR>
percentage of the money for nominating your account for this =
transaction</FONT>
