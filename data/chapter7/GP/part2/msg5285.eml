<br><br>There is nothing so annoying as a good example!!Those who =
haven't loved somebody else, more than they love themselves haven't even =
begun to live



<br>If you give money, spend yourself with it.


<BR><BR>I knew what my job was it was to go out and meet the people and =
love them.<BR>Without friends, no one would want to live, even if he had =
all other goods.



<BR><BR>When you reach for the stars, you may not quite get one, but you =
won't come up with a handful of mud either.<br><br>These two imparadised =
in one another's arms, the happier Eden, shall enjoy their fill of bliss =
on bliss.


<br><br>When your heart is in your dream, no request is too extreme.



The perfecting of one's self is the fundamental base of all progress and =
all moral development.<BR><BR>Nobility is a graceful ornament to the =
civil order. It is the Corinthian capital of polished society.Don't =
complain because you don't have. Enjoy what you've got.Deceive not thy =
physician, confessor, nor lawyer.
<br><br>The sublimity of wisdom is to do those things living that are =
desired when dying.
A man generally has the good or ill qualities he attributes to =
mankind.<BR>Whenever science makes a discovery, the devil grabs it while =
the angels are debating the best way to use it.



<br><br>The fact that logic cannot satisfy us awakens an almost =
insatiable hunger for the irrational.
<br><br>Man is an imagining being.The difference between utility and =
utility plus beauty is the difference between telephone wires and the =
spider web.
