<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Dear friend,<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;I wish to begin by way of introduction. I am Williems Tomu&nbsp; =
the first and only surviving son of late Marc Tomu&nbsp; one of the =
foremost and rich black farmers in Zimbabwe recently murdered in the =
land dispute in&nbsp; Zimbabwe.<BR>
<BR>
Before the death of my father, he had taken me to Johannesburg-South =
Africa, to deposit the sum of US$24 million (Tweenty Four Million United =
States Dollars) in one of the private security companies, as family =
valuables. when he realized the looming danger in Zimbabwe.<BR>
<BR>
This amount was meant for the purchase of new machineries and chemicals =
for the farms and also for the establishment of new farms in =
Swaziland.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;This land dispute started when President Robert Mugabe introduced =
a new land reform, which was particularly targeted at the rich white =
farmers and a few black farmers (my father included). This resulted in =
the gruesome killing of rich farmers (mainly whites) and the unlawful =
possession of their properties by Mugabe?s war veterans, under the =
disguise of fighting for the<BR>
interest of the country.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;It is against this background that I fled the country with my =
family, to the Netherlands where we are currently seeking asylum.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;I have decided to seek foreign assistance, as the Netherlands law =
prohibits asylum seekers from operating bank accounts or involve in =
financial transaction of any kind, hence this letter to you.<BR>
<BR>
All I need is your trustworthiness to be able to entrust the above said =
amount and help me with investment opportunities. My family?s survival =
depends on this money as we have virtually lost all our assets.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;There are two options, firstly, you can choose to accept 30% of =
the total amount for your assistance or go into partnership for the =
proper investment of the money in your country.<BR>
<BR>
We shall discuss in detail the modalities involved when you reply =
providing me with your telephone &amp; fax numbers.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;I await your reply through this email&nbsp; =
below&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; willamstomuj@netscape.net,) =
(williamstomu1@netscape.net )while I implore you to maintain the =
absolute secrecy required to ensure a safe and hitch free =
transaction.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;I shall furnish you with more details on request.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;Yours truly<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;Mr. Williems Tomu<BR>
