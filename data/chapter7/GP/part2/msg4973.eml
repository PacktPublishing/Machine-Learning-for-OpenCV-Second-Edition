purpose for which they were made; but I don't believe nature ever =

being I'm going to eat like a human being, so I've consumed my last =
Electrical Concentrated Food Tablet--and don't you forget it! The Demon =
sank into a chair, nerveless and limp, but still staring fearfully at =
the boy

Automatic Record of Events upon the table beside the other things
