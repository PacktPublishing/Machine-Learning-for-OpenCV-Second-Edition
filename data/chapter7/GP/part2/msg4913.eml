A Hollywood producer ws determined to give his mother a birthday =

about<BR>
an amazing bird which could talk in twelve languages and sing ten =
famous<BR>
operas. he immediately bought the bird and sent it to his mother. It =
cost<BR>
him $50,000.The day after her birthday, he phoned his mother. &quot;What =
did you<BR>
think of the bird, Mother?&quot; he asked eagerly. his mother =
replied,<BR>
&quot;Delicious!&quot;<BR>
A businessman entered a tavern, sat down at the bar, and ordered a =
double<BR>
martini on the rocks. After he finished the drink, he peeked inside =
his<BR>
shirt pocket, then he ordered another double martini. After he finished =
that<BR>
one, he again peeked inside his shirt pocket and ordered another =
double<BR>
martini. Finally, the bartender said, &quot;Look, buddy, I'll bring ya' =
martinis<BR>
all night long. But you gotta tell me why you look inside your shirt =
pocket<BR>
before you order a refill.&quot; The customer replied, &quot;I'm peeking =
at a photo of<BR>
my wife. When she starts to look good, then I know it's time to go =
home.&quot;<BR>
