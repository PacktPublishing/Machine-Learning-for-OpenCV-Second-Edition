RENO, Nev., Feb. 23, 2005 PRIMEZONE. Martin Nutraceuticals Inc. =
(MTNU)<BR>
is a company focused on developing natural and alternative medicine<BR>
products that provide better health for individuals through the use =
of<BR>
their wide range of products, which aid in joint therapy, digestive<BR>
therapy, WeightControl, blood circulation and alertness, and overall<BR>
improved<BR>
functioning of the b0dy.<BR>
<BR>
The flagship product which is based on Joint Therapy is used to aid =
in<BR>
joint and general arthritic pain. Over 65 million Americans suffer =
from<BR>
arthritis and osteoporosis. For several years, Dr. A. W. Martin DC,<BR>
PhD, RNCP, DNM, a world renowned researcher has studied the effects =
of<BR>
enzyme therapy on pain and inflammation. Dr. Martin has developed a =
unique<BR>
blend of proprietary and patented ``systemic oral enzymes'' designed =
to<BR>
provide superior anti-inflammatory benefits. Studies have shown that<BR>
Dr. Martin's Joint Therapy, proprietary enzyme formula reduces pain =
and<BR>
inflammation in 80% of patients who are diagnosed with Osteoarthritis =
of<BR>
the knees in less than 6-weeks.<BR>
<BR>
In another study conducted the patient Fibromyalgia -- a severe =
muscle<BR>
pain syndrome that affects more than 20 million North Americans -- =
90%<BR>
of patients reported relief from swelling and pain within 4-weeks of<BR>
using Dr. Martin's Joint Therapy formula.<BR>
<BR>
The nutraceuticals market has grown steadily at an incredible rate =
of<BR>
15-20% annually since 1998. Currently in North America, over 3.9 =
billion<BR>
is spent on over-the-counter and prescription medication for =
arthritis,<BR>
joint and muscle related pain alone. Since Dr. Martin's foray into =
the<BR>
nutraceuticals market, Dr. Martin's products have amassed sales over =
35<BR>
million. It is with this track record and knowledge that Martin<BR>
Nutraceuticals has re-branded many of Dr. Martin's successful formulas =
and<BR>
is<BR>
poised to unveil them onto an international platform.<BR>
<BR>
In the weeks and months to come, the company will be unveiling new<BR>
product lines, various sales targets, contracts, distribution =
agreements<BR>
and clinical data.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
About MTNU:<BR>
<BR>
MTNU is becoming quickly recognized in the nutraceutical marketplace<BR>
which will surpass 74.4 billion in the year 2007.&nbsp; With a growing =
demand<BR>
for nutraceutical products that provide not only health benefits, =
but<BR>
also prevent and provide treatment for disease, MTNU provides high<BR>
quality products that use proprietary and patented oral systemic =
enzymes<BR>
that help in the rapid absorption of the product, resulting in =
incredibly<BR>
swift, and effective results to symptoms including:<BR>
<BR>
JointPain<BR>
Cardiovascular Irregularities<BR>
Digestive Irregularities<BR>
Anti-Oxidization<BR>
WeightL0ss<BR>
<BR>
MTNU offers individuals a wide array of reliable and effective<BR>
nutraceuticals. Martin Nutraceuticals has created a family of =
complimentary<BR>
<BR>
medicine and supplementation that has helped thousands of people =
suffering<BR>
from arthritis and general jointpain, poor circulation, tiredness,<BR>
obesity and digestive complications.&nbsp; By integrating proprietary =
oral<BR>
systemic enzymes, MTNU has revolutionized the consumption of =
naturopathic<BR>
supplementation. With the use of these enzymes with products such as<BR>
Joint Therapy, MTNU has designed an innovative way to treat arthritis =
and<BR>
general jointpain.<BR>
<BR>
Millions of people in North America suffer from some degree of =
general<BR>
jointpain.&nbsp; According to the Arthritis Society, arthritis is =
North<BR>
America's most common ailment, with over 44 million North Americans<BR>
suffering.&nbsp; The Wall Street Journal, in the April 19th, 1999 issue =
states<BR>
that<BR>
Aspirin, Ibuprofen (Cox 1) Vioxx, Celebrex (Cox 2) killed 20,000<BR>
Americans a year and put another 100,000 in the hospital suffering =
with<BR>
drug<BR>
side effects including: liver damage, kidney damage and intestinal<BR>
hemorrhaging.&nbsp; With many of these products being pulled and =
highly<BR>
regulated because of the potential of deadly side effects, sufferers =
of<BR>
jointpain are seeking a natural, healthy alternative to aid in their<BR>
suffering.<BR>
<BR>
MTNU has developed a proprietary therapeutic product, Joint Therapy,<BR>
which is able to benefit all types of arthritis from: Rheumatoid<BR>
Arthritis, sports injuries, pelvic inflammation to cardiac =
inflammation.<BR>
MTNU's<BR>
unique marketing program consists of heavily aired infomercials, =
direct<BR>
mailorder marketing and large pharmaceutical and retail chains.<BR>
<BR>
Will MTNU explode higher as more and more investors become aware of =
the<BR>
stock?&nbsp; If you think so, you may not want to wait until it is too =
late.<BR>
Remember, timing your trade is critical.<BR>
<BR>
Good Luck and Happy Trading.<BR>
