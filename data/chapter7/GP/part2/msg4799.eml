A couple had been married for 25 years and were celebrating their =
60th<BR>
birthdays, which fell on the same day. During the celebration a =
fairy<BR>
appeared and said that because they had been such a loving couple for =
all 25<BR>

around<BR>
the world. The fairy waved her hand, and Boom! She had the tickets in =
her<BR>
hand. Next, it was the husband's turn. He paused for a moment, then =

me.&quot; The fairy<BR>
picked up her wand, and Boom!&nbsp; He was ninety.<BR>
