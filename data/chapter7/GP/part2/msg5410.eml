Bread never falls but on its buttered side.<BR>

Ask no questions and hear no lies. . A true friend is someone who =
reaches for your hand, but touches your heart. . A penny saved is a =
penny earned. . Never judge a book by its cover .<BR>
An apple a day keeps the doctor away.<BR>
<BR>
Keep your mouth shut and your eyes open.<BR>
<BR>
no more?<BR>

Leave no stone unturned. . Never cackle unless you lay. . Call a spade a =
spade. .<BR>
He that pays last never pays twice. . It's an ill wind that blows no-one =
some good. . More haste less speed. .<BR>
<BR>
While the cats away the mice play. . The early bird catches the worm. . =
There is a thin line between love and hate. .<BR>
