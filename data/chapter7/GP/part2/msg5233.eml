In order to transfer out to overseas ($ 28,500.000.00 USD) Twenty Eight =
Million Five hundred United States Dollars from Grand Trust Bank, Benin. =
I have the courage to ask for your assistance to handle this important =
and confidential business to provide either an existing bank account or =
to set up a new Bank a/c immediately to receive this money, even an =
empty a/c can serve to receive this funds quitely.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I am DR NESTOR NGWU the MANAGER of GRAND FINANCE AND TRUST, BENIN. There =
is an account opened in this bank in 1998 and since 2003 nobody has =
operated on this account again. After going through some old files in =
the records, I discovered that if I do not remit this money out urgently =
it will be forfeited for nothing.<BR>
The owner of this account is Engr. Luke Pepper, a foreigner, and a miner =
at LUKELIN INVESTMENT S.A, a&nbsp; Mechanical Engneer by profession and =
he died since 2000. No other person knows about this account or any =
thing concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and my =
investigation proved to me as well that this company does not know =
anything about this account and the amount involved is USD (USD $28.5 =
MILLION) Twenty Eight Million Five hundred United States Dollars.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I want to transfer the (USD $28.5 MILLION) Twenty Eight Million Five =
hundred United States Dollars) into a safe foreigners account abroad , =
but I don't know or have any foreigner, I am only contacting you as a =
foreigner because this money can not be approved to a local bank here, =
but can only be approved to any foreign account because the money is in =
us dollars and the former owner of the account, Engr. Luke Pepper, is a =
foreigner too. I know that this message will come to you as a surprise =
as we don=12t know our selves before,but be rest assure<BR>
that it is real and a genuine business. I only got your contact address =
from my secretary who operates computer with believe in God that you =
will never let me down in this business.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
You are the only person that I have contacted in this business, so =
please reply urgently so that I will inform you the next step to take =
urgently. Send also your private telephone and fax number including the =
full details of the account to be used for the deposit like I said =
before an empty account can be ok. I want us to meet face to face or =
sign a binding agreement to bind us together so that you can receive =
this money into a foreign account or any account of your choice where =
the fund will be safe. I will fly to your country for withdrawal and =
sharing and other investments.<BR>
<BR>
I am contacting you because of the need to involve a foreigner with =
foreign account and foreign beneficiary. I need your full co-operation =
to make this work fine because the management is ready to approve this =
payment to any foreigner who has correct information of this account, =
which I will give to you later immediately, if you are able and with =
capability to handle such amount in strict confidence and trust =
according to my instructions and advice for our mutual benefit because =
this opportunity will never come again in my life.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I need truthful person in this business because I don't want to make =
mistake I need your strong assurance and trust. With my position now in =
the office I can transfer this money to any foreigner's reliable =
account, which you can provide with assurance that this money will be =
intact pending my physical arrival in your country for sharing. and I =
want to remind you that your share has been carculated at 40% of the =
total sum. I waiting for your urgent reply so that i will give you more =
information about this transaction.<BR>
