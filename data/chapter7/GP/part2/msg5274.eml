<br>Architect. One who drafts a plan of your house, and plans a draft of =
your money.Do not do what you would undo if caught.
<br>Every exit is an entry somewhere else.


<br><br>I know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable =
ability of man to elevate his life by conscious endeavor.



<BR><BR>I will show you fear in a handful of dust.<BR><BR>Man is more =
interesting than men. God made him and not them in his image. Each one =
is more precious than all.



<br>Better to be known as a sinner than a hypocrite.


<br><br>The intelligent man finds almost everything ridiculous, the =
sensible man hardly anything.


In order to win, you must expect to win.



<BR><BR>I've been drunk for about a week now, and I thought it might =
sober me up to sit in a library.
<BR>Unless the theatre can ennoble you, make you a better person, you =
should flee from it.<br>Faith is not something to grasp, it is a state =
to grow into.


<BR><BR>The ideal committee is one with me as the chairman, and two =
other members in bed with the flu.<br><br>Our life is made by the death =
of others.



<br><br>If you are prepared, then you are able to feel confident.



<BR><BR>Laughter is not at all a bad beginning for a friendship, and it =
is far the best ending for one.

<BR><BR>Difficulties strengthen the mind, as labor does the body.



<BR><BR>As the family goes, so goes the nation and so goes the whole =
world in which we live.<br><A =
