<br>I do not read advertisements. I would spend all of my time wanting =
things.

<br>I'm their leader, I've got to follow them.


<BR><BR>What a grand thing it is to be clever and have common sense.



<BR>Natural forces within us are the true healers of disease
<BR>A building has integrity just like a man. And just as =
seldom.<BR><BR>I have a Vision of the Future, chum. The workers flats in =
fields of soya beans tower up like silver pencils, score on score.<br>I =
am not concerned that I am not known, I seek to be worthy to be =
known.<br>We are as much informed of a writer's genius by what he =
selects as by what he originates.<BR>Reading makes a full man, =
meditation a profound man, discourse a clear man.



<br>Who thinks the law has anything to do with justice? It's what we =
have because we can't have justice.



<BR>Computers in the future will weigh no more than 1.5 tons. [Quoted in =
Popular Mechanics 1950]<br>This is a world of action, and not for moping =
and droning in.<BR>Democracy! Bah! When I hear that word I reach for my =
feather Boa!



<BR>The role of the intelligence --that part of us which affirms and =
denies and formulates opinions is merely to submit.Drive your business, =
let not you're business drive you.<br>Every rascal is not a thief, but =
every thief is a rascal.
<br>Beware of all enterprises that require a new set of =
clothes.<br><br>No one can transcend their own individuality.<br><br><A =
