<br><br>Prosperity is the blessing of the Old Testament adversity is the =
blessing of the New.



<BR>In literature the ambition of the novice is to acquire the literary =
language: the struggle of the adept is to get rid of it.



<BR>Trouble shared is trouble halved.

<BR><BR>Personally, I'm always ready to learn, although I do not always =
like being taught.



<br><br>God knows best he hasn't arranged your anatomy so as to make it =
easy for you to pat yourself on the back.

<BR><BR>Be tolerant of the human race. Your whole family belongs to it =
-- and some of your spouse's family does too.



<BR>People want economy and they'll pay almost any price to get it.
<BR><BR>We have inherited the past we can create the future.<BR><BR>It =
is a fine thing to be honest, but it is also very important to be right.
<BR><BR>Science does not know its debt to imagination.


<BR><BR>There is no greater sorrow than to recall happiness in times of =
misery.<BR>To make your children capable of honesty is the beginning of =
education.<BR>The real people of genius were resolute workers not idle =
dreamers.
<BR>No one hates his job so heartily as a farmer.<br><br>The jingling of =
the guinea helps the hurt that Honor feels.



<br>He that waits for a dead man's shoes may long go barefoot.



<br>Always be nice to people on the way up because you'll meet the same =
people on the way down.



<br>Love doesn't make the world go round. Love is what makes the ride =
worthwhile.
