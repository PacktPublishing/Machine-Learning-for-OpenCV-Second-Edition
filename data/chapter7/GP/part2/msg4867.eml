<BR>
I am the above named person Mrs.Sarah Kushab,a Pakistani<BR>
national I was married to Dr.Michael Kushab who worked with<BR>
Pakistan embassy in the Republic of Benin for Five years<BR>
before he died in the year 2001. We were married for eleven<BR>
years and the union unfortunately did not produce any<BR>
offspring. Before his death we had given our lives to Christ<BR>
and were living according to the Word.<BR>
A few weeks ago i was diagnosed with cancer and the<BR>
doctor has informed me that i do not have much time to<BR>
live. Presently I am practically an invalid as the<BR>
cancer has ravaged my body and i can feel my life<BR>
slowly ebbing away. I do not have much time to do the<BR>
Lord's work but He will give me strength to see my<BR>
last assignment through.<BR>
My husband, Dr.Michael before his death deposited his<BR>
life savings $10.5Million (Ten Million<BR>
Five hundred thousand U.S. Dollars) with a financial<BR>
institution in the European continent. Before his<BR>
death, we were committed to the growth of the church<BR>
and the propagation of the word, but I can no longer<BR>
partake in these noble tasks. I need a church,<BR>
Christian individual or individuals who can continue<BR>
the work in our stead. who will utilize this money the<BR>
way I am going to instruct here into-fund churches,<BR>
orphanages and widows propagating the word of God and<BR>
to ensure that the house of God is maintained. To care<BR>
for the sick, the poor, the downtrodden wherever they<BR>
may be The Bible made us to understand that blessed is<BR>
the hand that gives. I took this decision because<BR>
I don't have any child or next of kin who can inherit<BR>
these wealth.<BR>
Though the internet is a seemingly unlikely<BR>
place to find such individuals, I believe that the<BR>
Lord hide s jewels in the most unlikely places. It is<BR>
not the means that is important but the message. I know<BR>
that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord.<BR>
Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my<BR>
case and I shall hold my peace. With God all things<BR>
are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall<BR>
give you the contact of financial institution in<BR>
Europe. I will also issue you a letter of authority<BR>
that will prove you as the original- beneficiary of<BR>
this fund. I want you and the church to always pray<BR>
for me because the lord is my shepherd. the Happiness<BR>
is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian.<BR>
Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I<BR>
stated herein. Hoping to hearing from you. Remain<BR>
blessed in the name of the Lord.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
N.B- MY LAWYER SHALL GIVE YOU ALL THE LEGAL ASSISTANCE<BR>
YOU NEED TO PUT CLAIM TO THE SAID FUNDS.<BR>
NAME:ADVOCATE JOSE VAN ROY<BR>
Remain blessed in the name of the Lord.<BR>
Yours in Christ,<BR>
