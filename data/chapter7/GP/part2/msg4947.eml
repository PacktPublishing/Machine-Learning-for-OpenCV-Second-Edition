When Tom Howard was seventeen years old he was as tall as his father, so =
he<BR>
began to borrow Mr. Howard's clothes when he wanted to go out with =
his<BR>
friends in the evening.Mr. Howard did not like this, and he always got =
very<BR>
angry when he found his son wearing any of his things.One evening when =
Tom<BR>
came downstairs to go out, his father stopped him in the hall. He looked =
at<BR>
Tom's clothes very carefully.Then he said angrily, &quot;Isn't that one =
of my<BR>
ties, Tom?&quot;&quot;Yes, Father, it is.&quot; answered Tom.&quot;And =
that shirt's mine too,<BR>
isn't that one of my ties, Tom?&quot;&quot;Yes, that's yours too,&quot; =
answered Tom.&quot;And<BR>
you're wearing my belt!&quot; said Mr. Howard.&quot;Yes, I am, =
Father,&quot; answered Tom.<BR>
&quot; You don't want your trousers to fall down, do you?&quot;<BR>
A guy walks into a post office one day to see a very well-dressed,<BR>
middle-aged, balding man standing at the counter methodically placing =
&quot;Love&quot;<BR>
stamps on a huge stack of bright pink envelopes. Each envelope has =
hearts<BR>
all over it. The man then takes out a perfume bottle and starts =
spraying<BR>
scent all over them. His curiosity getting the better of him, he goes up =
to<BR>
the balding man and asks him what he is doing. The man says &quot;I'm =
sending out<BR>
1,000 Valentines cards signed, 'Guess who?'&quot; &quot;But why?&quot; =
asks the man. &quot;I'm a<BR>
divorce lawyer,&quot; the man replies.<BR>
