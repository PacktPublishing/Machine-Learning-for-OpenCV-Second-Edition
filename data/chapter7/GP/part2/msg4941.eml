Hi Varou,=20
<p>
What is the ideal dosage for the drug that treats impotence in men? I =
have experimented with dosage and now find that 25 mg about one half =
hour before sex is perfect for me. I'm rock hard and can go forever.
<p>
We offer some of the affordable drugs available anywhere on the =
internet, with the convenience of our online tracking system and =
refills.
<p>
We use encrypted secure server technology.. <a =

<p>
Best regards,=20
