One day a visitor from the city came to a small rural area to drive =
around<BR>
the country roads, see how the farms looked, and perhaps to see how =
farmers<BR>
earned their living. The city man saw a farmer in his yard, holding a =
pig up<BR>
in his hands, and lifting it so that the pig could eat apples from an =
apple<BR>
tree. The city man said to the farmer,&quot; I see that your pig likes =
apples,<BR>
but isn&quot;t that quite a waste of time?&quot; The farmer =
replied,&quot; What&quot;s time to a<BR>
pig?&quot;<BR>
One evening, in the midst of dinner preparation, our 10-year-old =
daughter<BR>
asked, &quot;Mommy, what's puberty?&quot; My wife was rushed at the =
moment, so she<BR>
suggested that Peggy look up the word in the dictionary, after which =
they<BR>
could talk about it.A few minutes later, Peggy returned. Her mother =
asked<BR>
what the dictionary had said. &quot;Puberty means,&quot; announced =
Peggy, &quot;the<BR>
earliest age at which a girl is able to bear children.&quot;&quot;What =
do you think of<BR>
that?&quot; my wife asked.&quot;I'm not sure,&quot; Peggy relied. =
&quot;I've always been able to<BR>
bear children. It's adults I can't bear.&quot;.<BR>
