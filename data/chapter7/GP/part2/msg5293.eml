<BR>You can lease the peace of mind You bought a mask, I put it on. You =
never thought to ask me If I wear it when you're gone<BR>A book is the =
only immortality.



<br>His hilarity was like a scream from a crevasse.


<BR><BR>Eyes lie if you ever look into them for the character of the =
person.<BR><BR>The best leaders... almost without exception and at every =
level, are master users of stories and symbols.

<BR>Familiarity breeds contempt and children.

<br><br>So live that you can look any man in the eye and tell him to go =
to hell.<BR><BR>People are slow to believe that, which if believed would =
work them harm.



<BR>Experience is a comb which nature gives to men when they are =
bald.=0D


<br>We pay when old for the excesses of youth.



<br>There is a great man who makes every man feel small. But the real =
great man is the man who makes every man feel great.



If you have a dream, give it a chance to happen.<BR><BR>All noble =
enthusiasms pass through a feverish stage, and grow wiser and more =
serene.



<br>Better to be ignorant of a matter than half know it.

<br>It is with trifles and when he is off guard that a man best reveals =
his character.



<br>That which we obtain too easily, we esteem too lightly.<br>You can =
fail so very often. But you are not a failure until you give up.<BR>You =
talk too much, you laugh too loud, that's the price of love.<BR><BR><A =
