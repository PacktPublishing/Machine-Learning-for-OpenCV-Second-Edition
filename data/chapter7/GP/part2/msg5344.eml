<br><br>Any change or reform you make is going to have consequence you =
don't like.<BR>Our enemies approach nearer to truth in their judgments =
of us than we do ourselves.<BR>Endurance is one of the most difficult =
disciplines, but it is to the one who endures that the final victory =
comes.
What we hope ever to do with ease, we must learn first to do with =
diligence.


If you want to achieve excellence, you can get there today. As of this =
second, quit doing less-than-excellent work.



If the other person injures you, you may forget the injury but if you =
injure him you will always remember.<BR>You don't have to burn books to =
destroy a culture. Just get people to stop reading them.Laws are =
subordinate to custom.<br>Speak low if you speak love.<BR><BR>Books like =
friends, should be few and well-chosen.Nothing is so dangerous as being =
too modern one is apt to grow old fashioned quite suddenly.


It is Homer who has chiefly taught other poets the art of telling lies =
skillfully.<br><br>Seek to make a person blush for their guilt rather =
than shed their blood.



<br><br>Ability may get you to the top, but it takes character to keep =
you there.
<br>In tribulation immediately draw near to God with confidence, and you =
will receive strength, enlightenment, and instruction.



<BR>When I look into the future, it is so bright it burns my eyes.

<br><br>It is not enough to succeed, others must fail.
