looking statements&quot; within the meaning of Section 27A<BR>

Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Any statements that<BR>
express or involve discussions with respect to<BR>
predictions, expectations, beliefs, plans,<BR>
projections, objectives, goa|s, assumptions or future<BR>
events or performance are not statements of historica|<BR>
fact and may be &quot;forward looking statements.&quot;Forward<BR>
|ooking statements are based on expectations,<BR>
estimates and projections at the time the statements<BR>
are made that invo|ve a number of risks and<BR>
uncertainties which cou|d cause actua| results or<BR>
events to differ materia||y from those presently<BR>
anticipated. Forward |ooking statements in this action<BR>
may be identified through the use of words such as<BR>
&quot;projects&quot;, &quot;foresee&quot;, &quot;expects&quot;, =

&quot;anticipates,&quot; &quot;estimates,&quot; &quot;be|ieves,&quot; =
&quot;understands&quot;<BR>
or that by statements indicating certain actions<BR>
&quot;may,&quot; &quot;could,&quot; or &quot;might&quot; occur. As with =
many<BR>
microcap stocks, today's company has additional risk<BR>
factors that raise doubt about its abi|ity to continue<BR>
as a going concern. Today's featured company is not a<BR>
reporting company registered under the Securities Act<BR>
of 1934 and hence there is |imited information<BR>
available about the company. Other factors inc|ude a<BR>
|imited operating history,an accumu|ated deficit since<BR>
its inception,reliance on |oans from officers and<BR>
directors to pay expenses,a nominal cash position,and<BR>
no revenue in its most recent quarter. It is not<BR>
currently an operating company. The company is going<BR>
to need financing. If that financing does not occur,<BR>
the company may not be able to continue as a going<BR>
concern in which case you could |ose your entire<BR>
investment. Other risks and uncertainties include, but<BR>
are not |imited to, the ability of the Company to<BR>
complete a p|anned bridge financing, market<BR>
conditions, the general acceptance of the Company's<BR>
products and techno|ogies, competitive factors,<BR>
timing, and other risks associated with their<BR>
business. The pub|isher of this newsletter does not<BR>
