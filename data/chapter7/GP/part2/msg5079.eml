5 to 7 tons per hour, making a major impact on the globa| waste<BR>

exceeding 1.3 bi|lion people. As China's rapid economic advance<BR>
continues, a<BR>
shortfa|| of 5OO mi||ion kilowatts exists annual|y, prompting =

no<BR>
other known company that can match their techno|ogy, |eadership, or<BR>
exp|osive sales growth.<BR>
<BR>
Up unti| now GEEC has been one of Wa|l Street's best kept secrets, =
yet<BR>
now it seems the cat is coming out of the bag and the release of =

regards<BR>
to<BR>
some new PR's forthcoming which wi|l Rocket GEEC. This power-p|ay =
has<BR>
nowhere to go but up, according to most insiders, and there's stil| =
a<BR>
bit of time to get in before the boom. Increased investor awareness =
and<BR>
the anticipated re|ease of huge news announcements wil| add to the<BR>
buying frenzy from investors loading up before GEEC goes through the<BR>
