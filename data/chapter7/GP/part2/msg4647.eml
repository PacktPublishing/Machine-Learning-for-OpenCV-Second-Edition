<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>FROM: DR. ADAMS OSIME<BR>
INTERNET FAX NUMBER: 1650 897 9125<BR>
REPLY TO: adams_osime@rediffmail.com<BR>
<BR>
PLEASE GIVE ME AN IMMEDIATE RESPONSE<BR>
<BR>
This is to seek your cooperation as my foreign partner and your =
assistance<BR>
to enable me own a property and invest in the stable economy of your =
country.<BR>
Accept my apologies if this mail does not suit your personal or =
business<BR>
ethics.<BR>
<BR>
My name is Dr. Adams Osime, I am making this venture proposal to you =
in<BR>
strict confidence. The money we want to invest was acquired from an =
over<BR>
invoiced contract proceed. This is in my capacity as the chairperson =
of<BR>
the senate financial committee<BR>
on foreign contracts verification and payments (Member, Contract =
Review<BR>
Panel [CRP]). Our good fortune is that we are privy to such classified =
information.<BR>
<BR>
The amount in question is $27,300,000.00 Million US dollars. As a =
senior<BR>
civil servant in the Nigerian Government, our country's prudential =
policy<BR>
prohibits me from operating a foreign account. If you would like to =
assist<BR>
me as a partner, please kindly indicate your interest after which we =
shall<BR>
both discuss on the modalities.<BR>
<BR>
All other information to facilitate the remittance of the funds will =
be<BR>
revealed to you in due course. For your assistance, you shall receive =
25%<BR>
of the funds to be transferred and 5% will be set aside for all =
expenses<BR>
incurred by both parties.<BR>
<BR>
I would appreciate if this proposal is kept confidential because of =
what<BR>
I have explained above. Note that you can reach me urgently on my =
e-mail,<BR>
&nbsp;or in my&nbsp; (American internet fax number, which I believe is =
more secure).<BR>
<BR>
Please do indicate your direct telephone and fax number when replying =
to<BR>
this business proposal. I will be calling you when necessary. In the =
meantime,<BR>
I will appreciate if you can call me or make your contacts through my =
alternative<BR>
email : adams_osime@rediffmail.com&nbsp;<BR>
A swift acknowledgement on the receipt of this mail will be =
appreciated.<BR>
<BR>
Best regards,<BR>
Dr. Adams Osime,<BR>
adams_osime@rediffmail.com&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
NB: PLEASE TREAT AS URGENT<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
