Nigeria by an act of parliament to provide alternative funding for =
sports development in Nigeria. The lottery is played through play slips =
available at designated retail outlets in Nigeria and Overseas. Using =
the play slips, players must choose six numbers between 1 and 45, and =
mark them in a number panel on the play slip.<BR>

balloting system for internet users with valid email addresses. This is =
