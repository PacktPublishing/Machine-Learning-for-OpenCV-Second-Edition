Hi Varou,=20

Mind-body research shows that the words you use can have a powerful =
effect on how you feel. Most anxiety sufferers use negative words that =
destroy their self-esteem and promote a sense of loss of control. These =
are "victim" words. A few victim words include: can't, always, never, =
and should.=20
