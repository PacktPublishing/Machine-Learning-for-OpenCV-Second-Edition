<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>&nbsp; Dear Sir/Madam,<BR>
<BR>
As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I =
believe everyone will die someday. My name is Millah Khalid a merchant =
in Dubai, in the U.A.E. I have been diagnosed with Esophageal =
cancer.<BR>
It has defied all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only =
about a few months to live, according to medical experts in Hong =
Kong.<BR>
<BR>
I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared =
for anyone(not even myself) but my business. Though I am very rich, I =
was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on =
my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all =
this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have =
or make all the money in the world. I believe when God/Allah gives me a =
second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way =
from how I have lived it. Now that God has called me, I have given most =
of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as =
well as a few close friends. I want God to be merciful to me and accept =
my soul so, I have decided to give also to charity organizations, as I =
want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have =
distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria =
and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly before I was =
flew to Hong Kong,so I cannot do this myself anymore.<BR>
<BR>
I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and =
distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in =
Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to themselves. =
Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended =
with what I have left for them.<BR>
<BR>
The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of =
$5,500,000.00USD Five million five hundred thousand dollars that I have =
with a Bank in Europe. I will want a GOD fearing person with sympathetic =
mind that will send his profile to confirm his dignity to help me =
COLLECT THIS DEPOSIT AND DISPATCHED it to charity organizations as this =
will enable my name to be publish in their monthly magazines as a donor =
and honor to Allah.<BR>
<BR>
You can contact via my personal email address below:<BR>
millah004@netscape.net or fax:00852-30173957<BR>
Because this is the only way possible to communicate based on my present =
state.<BR>
<BR>
May God be with you.<BR>
Millah Khalid.<BR>
