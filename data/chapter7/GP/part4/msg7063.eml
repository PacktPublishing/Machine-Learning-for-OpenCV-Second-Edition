<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Dear Sir/Madam,<BR>
<BR>
I beg you to carefully go through this email and should it not meet<BR>
your business or personal ethics, please accept my apologies in =
advance.<BR>
My name is David Roberts, the Chief Executive of Private Clients =
&amp;<BR>
International of the Barclays Group with head office at 54 Lombard<BR>
street, London EC3P 3AH.<BR>
<BR>
I am writing this letter to solicit for your support<BR>
and assistance to carry out a project concerning a late customer of =
the<BR>
bank by name Dr. Victor Morgan, an oil magnet and philanthropist who =
died on<BR>
the 14th of June 2002 in the London Hospital after being involved in =
fatal<BR>
car crash which also claimed the life of his wife and two sons.<BR>
<BR>
Lying in his inactive account in one of our branches is the sum of<BR>
Thirty Million United States Dollars. Ever since he died the bank has =
placed a<BR>
stop on all transactions on this account pending when his next of kin =
would<BR>
come forward for necessary actions, identification and collection.<BR>
Unfortunately from our investigations and confirmations from his =
attorney he has no<BR>
family members who are aware of the existence of the money and as such, =
we<BR>
have decided to do business with you.<BR>
<BR>
If you stand in as the beneficiary of this funds the money will be<BR>
released to you, after the due processes have being followed.<BR>
<BR>
Obviously we do not want this money to go into the Bank Treasury<BR>
because the banking law and guideline stipulates that if such fund =
remains<BR>
unclaimed for 3 years, the money will be transferred into the Bank =
Treasury as<BR>
unclaimed debt. This would not take too much time to get done as his =
lawyer<BR>
already has the necessary Letters of Administration and court orders =
from the<BR>
British high court which are part of the documents required by the<BR>
Barclays bank to process fund release approvals.<BR>
<BR>
To do this work 75% of the money will be for our end, 20% will be =
for<BR>
you while 5% will be for any xpenses incurred during the =
transaction.<BR>
Please reach me at my private email address above, if willing to do =
business<BR>
with us.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks and regards,<BR>
<BR>
David Roberts.<BR>
