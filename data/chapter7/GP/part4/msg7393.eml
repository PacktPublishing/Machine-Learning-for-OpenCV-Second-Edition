<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Hey I'am Julie ^_^. I just turned 18 -High school =
senior in Houston, TX. I was waiting for such a long time until this =
day. I finally got my wish.. I am just simply trying to show off and =
meet new cyber friends. And who knows where that can lead to ;D. Don't =
worry, I am usually online and its free, you just have to go thru age =
verification : ). I can't have youngers snooping around hehe.<BR>
