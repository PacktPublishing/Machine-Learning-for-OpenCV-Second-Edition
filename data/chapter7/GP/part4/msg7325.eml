Dear Sir<BR>
<BR>
RE: JOINT VENTURE.<BR>
<BR>
I would like to apply through this medium for your co-operation and to =
secure an opportunity to invest and do joint business with you in your =
country.<BR>
<BR>
I have a substantial capital I honorably intend to invest in your =
country into a very lucrative venture of which you are to advise and =
execute the said venture over there for the mutual benefits of both of =
us. Your able co-operation is to become my business partner in your =
country and create ideas on how money will be invested, probably managed =
and the type of investment after the money is transferred to your =
custody with your assistance.<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, on indication of your willingness to handle this transaction =
sincerely by protecting our interests and upon your acceptance of this =
proposal, I would furnish you with the full detailed =
information,procedure, amount involve and mutual agreement on your =
percentage interest or share holding for helping me to secure the =
release of the deposit and investing the<BR>
money.<BR>
<BR>
I shall be glad to reserve this respect and opportunity for you, if you =
so desire, but i do urge you to give the matter your immediate attention =
it deserves.<BR>
<BR>
Looking forward to your response.<BR>
