<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;From MrI.Kamara<BR>
<BR>
TEL +27 73 399 1977<BR>
<BR>
DEAR ,<BR>
<BR>
This letter was borne out of my sincere desire to establish a =
business/mutual<BR>
relationship with you. I got your contact through the international =
trade<BR>
and commerce (ITCC).<BR>
<BR>
My name is Ibram Kamara the son of late Chief Abraham P.Kamara (the =
former<BR>
deputy minister of finance under the ousted civilian government) who =
was<BR>
killed and mutilated by the military junta led by major, Paul Koroma =
after<BR>
overthrowing the elected government of president Tejan. Through, I do =
not<BR>
know to what extent you are familiar with events and disturbance in =
Sierra-Leone<BR>
but the pressure of war drove my mother and I out of Sierra -Leone =
into<BR>
exile in South Africa where we have been living under political asylum =
for<BR>
years.<BR>
<BR>
Sadly, my mother died of cancer 2 months ago and was buried here in =
South<BR>
Africa . Prior to her death, she handed me over a certificate meant =
for<BR>
a secret deposit, which my father made in a security/finance company =
in<BR>
europe the deposit that worth US$25,000,000 ( Twenty five million U.S =
dollars)<BR>
this was the money paid to his corporation by it's overseas customers =
in<BR>
the heat of the conflict. He made the deposit in his name and also =
deposited<BR>
it as a family tresures, with the hope of converting it to his =
personal<BR>
use at the end of the war but he was killed when the conflict =
intensified<BR>
as a result of his opposition to the rebel forces. I have contracted =
the<BR>
Security/finance Company to confirm the deposit and establish =
ownership.<BR>
<BR>
Due to the death of my Mother, I have decided to solicit for the =
participation<BR>
of an honest and trustworthy person or company that will assist in =
acting<BR>
as my representative who will jointly signed the agreement for the =
safe<BR>
keeping of the money in the security/finance company. The =
security/finance<BR>
company don't know the content of the consignment, they believe that =
it<BR>
is African artefact. As contained in 2 trunk boxes. Unfortunately, My =
mum<BR>
who is surpose to assist me in releasing the consignment has died of =
cancer<BR>
that is why I am looking for your assistance. I cannot do it alone due =
to<BR>
my present social status and total ignorance of the business world. I =
shall<BR>
also give you 20% of the funds for your assistance to relocate this =
fund<BR>
to your country and for re-investment while the rest will be kept in =
any<BR>
account of your choice for inverstmant purpose. i would have done the =
transfer<BR>
myself as my name is written as the next of kin,but because of my =
present<BR>
status in this country as a refugee i will not be allowed to handle =
such<BR>
money or else it will be confisticated by the goverment if found in my =
possetion,and<BR>
also i will not be allowed to open an account as a refugee not even to =
talk<BR>
of inversting such an amount of money,these are the reasons why i need =
your<BR>
assistance,If you are interested in helping me out of this my present =
situation,<BR>
contact me immediately through my email and i will funish you with =
other<BR>
details you need to conclude this transaction.this transaction is =
absolutely<BR>
risk free and of biliteral benefits as i have all neccesray legal =
documents<BR>
backing it up.please get back to me with your full name,tel.no fax no =
and<BR>
also your home addres so as to enable me introduce you to the =
security/finance<BR>
company handling the consignment as my representative.after all these =
you<BR>
will then make an arrangement on how we are going to meet face to face =
and<BR>
discuss in details.<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, I cannot travel out because i have no travelling documents =
for<BR>
now,i also hope that after everything you will secure a visa for me to =
join<BR>
you in your country so that i can continue my studies over there. I =
hope<BR>
to hear from you soon<BR>
<BR>
Best regards,<BR>
MR IBRAM KAMARA<BR>
