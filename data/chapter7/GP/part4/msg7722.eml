<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Hello!<BR>
<BR>
We would like to offer V_I_A_G_R_A soft tabs,<BR>
<BR>
These pills are just like regular V=ECagra but they are specially =
formulated<BR>
to be soft and dissolvable under the tongue. The pill is absorbed at =
the<BR>
mouth and enters the bloodstream directly instead of going through the =
stomach.<BR>
This results in a faster more powerful effect which lasts as long as the =
normal.<BR>
<BR>
Soft Tabs also have less sidebacks (you can drive or mix alcohol drinks =
with them).<BR>
<BR>
You can get it at: <A =
