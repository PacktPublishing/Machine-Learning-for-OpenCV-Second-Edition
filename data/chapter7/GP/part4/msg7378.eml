<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>AN OPEN LETTER TO&nbsp; MUSLIMS ONLY<BR>
(A Message For Peace And Reconciliation)<BR>
<BR>
Dear Brothers and Sisters,<BR>
<BR>
God forbid if any one of our near one and dear one is killed then the =
killer is evil, a beast and what not and should get penalty but if one =
among us kills anybody then he is not evil and we start finding =
justifications behind killing.... double standards?<BR>
<BR>
Being Muslims, many of our brothers and sisters are not working for =
peace. They are misguided, mistaken and spreading the virus of hatred =
and revenge through disinformation and false accusations, which is =
resulting in death and miseries for number of innocent people living =
around the world at the hands of merciless KILLER MUSLIMS and also =
bringing bad name to MOHAMMED (PBUH) who never killed anyone in his life =
time.<BR>
<BR>
Instead of teaching about Good &amp; Evil, certain Radical Muslim =
Clerics are only &quot;Trading in Religion&quot;. They teach us about =
accusing, abusing and killing the non-Muslims. They try to hypnotize us =
to Hate and Kill the non-Muslims and brethren of other sects or be =
killed and without using any common sense, we readily believe in =
whatever is being said by these Hate Mongers.&nbsp; Actually, they are =
&quot;Agents of Satan&quot; who is paying them heavily and in return =
they are cutting at the very roots of the Ummah. Instead of =
&quot;Mourning&quot; most of the Muslims are rejoicing on the brutal =
killings of the non-combatant innocent civilians and &quot;The =
Murderers&quot; have always been &quot;Our Great Heroes&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
Before it is too late and the Curse Of God falls upon us, we should use =
common sense, find out the truth and wakeup to save Muslims from =
becoming the most &quot;Hated, Isolated, Discredited and =
Suspicious&quot; people in the world. We must start working for =
promoting &quot;Sectarian Harmony and Religious Tolerance&quot; in the =
society and should prove to the WORLD through our deeds that MOHAMMED =
(PBUH) teaches &quot;Love &amp; Peace&quot; and not Gangsterism, =
Terrorism, Extremism, Sectarianism, Cruelty, Inhumanity and &quot;Hatred =
&amp; Killing&quot; of the innocent civilians.<BR>
<BR>
Islam is a religion of peace. Islam teaches respect and love for all =
even the animals. But many narrow-minded Muslims have so far failed to =
learn anything from the teachings of Mohammed (PBUH). We are far away =
from the basic principle of Islam i.e. &quot;Enjoining the people to do =
Good and forbidding them from Doing Evil&quot;. Unfortunately, most of =
us remember only one thing to be called as good Muslims and that is to =
&quot;hate&quot; the non-Muslims&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
The killing of others in the name of religion is a Sin. Can a FATHER =
ever teach his Children to be the permanent Enemies of each other?<BR>
<BR>
MY PRAYER FOR PEACE:<BR>
<BR>
Merciful God, please give to peoples of the world, the required wisdom =
and determination, to Forgive and Forget the bitterness of the past and =
learn to live in peace like brothers and sisters, by ending the =
divisions and hatreds created in us by our past and present elders. =
(Amen)<BR>
<BR>
I seek YOUR OPINION to correct the situation.<BR>
<BR>
Thanking you in advance,<BR>
