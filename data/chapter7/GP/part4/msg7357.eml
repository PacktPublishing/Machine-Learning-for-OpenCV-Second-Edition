1.&nbsp; Wicklund derives significant advantages from its developed =
strategic relationship with Georgia Pacific Corporation, a major =
building products distributor and the 2nd largest reseller of rebar in =
the US.&nbsp; Through this relationship, the Company has obtained an =
exclusive US marketing and distribution agreement and a significant =
order commitment which will drive revenues over the near term.<BR>
<BR>
2.&nbsp; The Company has developed a leading position in the rapidly =
expanding US market for plastic lumber products with introduction of its =
DURALAST line of plastic and plastic composite lumber products.&nbsp; =
Offering a number of advantages compared to conventional pressure =
treated lumber, plastic and composite lumber are highly durable, do not =
rot, crack, splinter, or decompose, and require almost no maintenance; =
increasingly plastic lumber is becoming the product of choice for a =
number of new construction and building applications.&nbsp; Sales of =
plastic lumber are growing at over 40% per year, and the US market is =
expected to reach $1.5 billion by 2006.<BR>
<BR>
3. Wicklund's patented line of rebar supports are the most durable and =
high quality product currently on the market, and have been validated =
through successful use in a number of major, high profile construction =
projects including Boston's "Big Dig" transportation project, =
Cleveland's Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame, the Tennessee Aquarium, the =
Nuclear Regulatory Facility at Los Alamos, NM, and the Toronto =
Skydome.&nbsp; Wicklund's plastic rebar supports are widely regarded as =
the highest quality in the industry and in testing at the University of =
Kentucky have demonstrated superior strength, resistance to water, and =
ionization, all of which contribute to concrete deterioration and =
spalling.&nbsp; Moreover, relative to the closest competitive products =
manufactured by Aztec, the market leader (a division of Dayton =
Superior), Wicklund's products are available at superior pricing =
levels<BR>
<BR>
4.&nbsp; Wicklund is well situated to benefit from an upturn in =
transportation infrastructure spending provided by recent passage of the =
Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity Act of =
2003.&nbsp; The signature of this bill, an improvement over 1998's $218 =
billion TEA-21, will authorize $275 billion in transportation spending =
over the next six years to maintain and repair the nation's aging =
transportation grid.&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
5.&nbsp; The Company has created a strong and experienced management =
team, who has been successful in establishing Wicklund's strong product =
offering and negotiating critical distribution relationships, and brings =
unique industry experience and knowledge.&nbsp; CEO James Turek has an =
extensive experience in the plastics industry, with past positions =
including President of International Plastics Corporation, a distributor =
of consumer recycled plastic products, and has played an instrumental =
role in the R&amp;D efforts of the Company.&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
This stock will see major upward movement in the next several weeks. =
Right now, WKDH is one of the Street's best kept secrets, but it will =
not remain that way for long. This is a unique opportunity to get in =
while trading levels are still low. As the Company goes forward with its =
business plan and signs major new contracts, this stock will move =
quickly. This is your last chance to invest before WKDH begins major =
price appreciation. This stock could reach $0.50 in the next five =
trading days!<BR>
