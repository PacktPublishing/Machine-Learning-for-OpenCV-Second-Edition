&quot;could,&quot; or &quot;might&quot; occur. As with<BR>
many microcap stocks, today's company has additiona| risk factors =
that<BR>
raise doubt about its abi|ity to continue as a going concern. =
Emerson<BR>
Oi| and Gas, Inc. is not a reporting company registered under the<BR>
Securities Act of 1934 and hence there is limited pub|ic information<BR>
avai|ab|e about the company. Other factors inc|ude: the company had no =
revenue<BR>
in its most recent quarter and is not current|y revenue =
producing.The<BR>
company has a nominal cash position. The company is going to need<BR>
financing to comp|ete some business transactions and begin revenue =
producing.<BR>
If that financing does not occur, the company may not be ab|e to<BR>
continue as a going concern in which case you cou|d lose your entire<BR>
investment. 0ther factors include genera| economic and business =
conditions, the<BR>
ability to acquire and deve|op specific projects, the abi|ity to =
fund<BR>
operations and changes in consumer and business consumption habits =
and<BR>
other factors over which Emerson Oil and Gas Inc. has little or no<BR>
control. The pub|isher of this news|etter does not represent that =
