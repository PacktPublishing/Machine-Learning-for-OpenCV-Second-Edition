Brief Profile:<BR>
<BR>
Globetech Ventures Corp. is a global mining company<BR>
engaged in acquiring and developing mineral properties<BR>
and, if warranted, the processing of related mineral<BR>
resources. Company owns through its Brazilian<BR>
subsidiary title to 197,000 acres (80,000 hectars ) of<BR>
mineral rights in Brazil=12s gold and other mineral rich<BR>
Vila Nova greenstone Belt. This month company acquired<BR>
100% interest in a molybendum (metallic element used<BR>
principally as an alloying agent in steel, cast iron,<BR>
and superalloys) rich property in British Colombia.<BR>
<BR>
Gold Mining Potential:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
The Vila Nova greenstone belt forms part of a stable<BR>
Precambrian Guinan Shield rock formation, which in the<BR>
adjacent countries of Venezuela, French Guiana and<BR>
Guyana, hosts world class gold deposits. The Omai gold<BR>
deposit in Guyana, has a reserve of approximately 4.2<BR>
million ounces of gold. The Guinan shield has<BR>
historically produced large amounts of gold, some 4.8<BR>
million ounces having been mined in the 19th century<BR>
alone. In the Vila Nova greenstone belt, in similar<BR>
rocks to those found in Globetech's claim area, the<BR>
Amapari gold deposit lies north of the Corporation's<BR>
claim area. The Amapari gold deposit which has a<BR>
resource in excess of 2 million ounces of gold, was<BR>
recently acquired by Wheaton River Minerals for $105<BR>
million.<BR>
<BR>
Strong Buy. Why Now?<BR>
<BR>
The stock is incredibly cheap and it has been off the<BR>
radar screen of Canadian mining funds until now. All<BR>
indicators point to an expected sharp rise in the<BR>
value of this company. There=12s been talk of heavy<BR>
institutional investments in Globetech. Technically<BR>
the stock is near it=12s 2 months support line and looks<BR>
ready to retest the $1.73 high. Gold has been<BR>
declining for nearly three months, but despite the<BR>
short term correction gold is still above the 65-week<BR>
moving average and is ready to resume it=12s strong bull<BR>
trend. Increasing gold prices will push Globetech=12s<BR>
value as well.&nbsp; In addition to its current operations<BR>
the company is pursuing and evaluating potential mineral<BR>
properties that can potential double or triple the<BR>
company=12s value.<BR>
