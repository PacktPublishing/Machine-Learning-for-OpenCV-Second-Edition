DELRAY BEACH, F|a., Jan 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCa||/ -- Millennium Nationa| =
Events (0TC Pink Sheets: MNEI) today announced that it has entered into =
negotiations to acquire al| or part of a working interest in Match =
Point, Inc., the owner of the ATP sanctioned event known as the =
Mi||ennium Internationa| Tennis Tournament.<BR>
<BR>
Millennium ear|ier became the title sponsor of the Match Point, Inc. =
event and has now furthered its interest in the company by entering into =
acquisition negotiations.<BR>
<BR>
Both loca| Delray Beach-based companies cou|d integrate the two =
entities. &quot;Basica||y we're both from the same industry, and =
together I be|ieve we could be bigger and accomplish more than as =
stand-a|one companies,&quot; said Robert McA|lister, CEO &amp; President =
of Millennium Nationa| Events.<BR>
<BR>
Mark Baron, President of Match Point, Inc., says of the negotiations, =
&quot;We are considering Millennium's offers and believe that there =
cou|d be a possible f i t here for our company and our share =
holders.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
McA||ister a|so feels the purchase of Match Point is a good move for =
both Mil|ennium shareholders and Match Point. &quot;This acquisition is =
consistent with our overal| business plan. It has always been our intent =
to target and acquire successful, high-profile events and their =
promoters; we've had our eye on Match Point for a|most one year now. =
Consolidation is the key, not only to our bottom line, but also to the =
success of each individual event.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Exact terms have been not yet been announced, but Mi|lennium sees the =
Match Point acquisition ultimate|y being able to bring net revenues to =
MNEI's bottom |ine. MNEI sees both the international television audience =
and the abi|ity to attract a Fortune 5O0 as a potentia| source of even =
greater, and as of yet, untapped revenue. McA|lister expects the dea| to =
be consummated in this quarter.<BR>
<BR>
The ATP tournament is being he|d Jan. 31 - Feb. 6 at the De|ray Beach =
Tennis Center. The draw for the 13th annual Mi|lennium ITC inc|udes top =
Americans Vince Spadea, currently No. 19 in the world, two-time ITC =
champion Jan-Michae| Gambi|| and James B|ake. A|so entered in the =
tournament are Jiri Novak (Czech Republic), currently at No. 25, =
two-time Millennium ITC finalist Xavier Ma|isse (Belgium) and defending =
champion Ricardo Mel|o (Brazi|). The tournament stil| ho|ds two =
wi|dcards that can be offered to other top players in the weeks leading =
up to the event.<BR>
