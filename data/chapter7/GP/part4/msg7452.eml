<br><br>To me, fair friend, you never can be old. For as you were when =
first your eye I eyed. Such seems your beauty still.<BR><BR>Fear of =
change perplexes monarchs.
<br>If your energy is as boundless as your ambition, total commitment =
may be a way of life you should seriously consider.



<BR><BR>A man of knowledge lives by acting, not by thinking about =
acting.<br><br>There is many a boy here today who looks on war as all =
glory, but boys it is all hell.
<BR><BR>The white man knows how to make everything, but he does not know =
how to distribute it.

<br>Those who play with the devil's toys will be brought by degrees to =
wield his sword.



<br><br>Books give not wisdom where none was before. But where some is, =
there reading makes it more.



<BR>Prithee don't screw your wit beyond the compass of good manners.



<BR><BR>One may go a long way after one is tired.

<br><br>If you want to be a winner, hang around with winners
<BR><BR>The display of grief makes more demands than grief itself. How =
few men are sad in their own company.



<BR>A person dishonored is worst than dead.<br>The pencil of the Holy =
Ghost hath labored more in describing the afflictions of Job than the =
felicities of Solomon.



<BR><BR>Skillful listening is the best remedy for loneliness, =
loquaciousness, and laryngitis.<br>The bastard! He doesn't exist!


Always remember, a cat looks down on man, a dog looks up to man, but a =
pig will look man right in the eye and see his equal.<br><br>The wise =
does at once what the fool does at last.
