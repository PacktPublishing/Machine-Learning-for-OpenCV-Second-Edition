Leadership involves finding a parade and getting in front of =
it.<br><br>Ambition is a lust that is never quenched, but grows more =
inflamed and madder by enjoyment.<br>We judge ourselves by what we feel =
capable of doing, while others judge us by what we have already =
done.<BR><BR>Whatever deceives men seems to produce a magical =
enchantment.<br>Pandemonium did not reign it poured.<BR><BR>There is no =
love sincerer than the love of food.
<BR><BR>He that is conscious of guilt cannot bear the innocence of =
others: So they will try to reduce all others to their own =
level.<BR>Competition is a process or variety of habitual behavior that =
grows out of a habit of mind.<br>It has yet to be proven that =
intelligence has any survival value.



<BR>He is mad past recovery, but yet he has lucid intervals.



<BR><BR>There are more love songs than anything else. If songs could =
make you do something we'd all love one another.

Nothing dies harder than a bad idea.



<br>Failure too is a form of death...<br><br>Writing about music is like =
dancing about architecture it's a really stupid thing to want to =
do.<br>Love is only chatter, friends are all that matter.



<BR>Be not curious in unnecessary matters: for more things are shrewd =
unto thee than men understand.



<br><br>One of the striking differences between a cat and a lie is that =
the cat has only nine lives.<br>Man is emphatically a proselytizing =
creature.
