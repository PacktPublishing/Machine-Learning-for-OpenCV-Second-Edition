--EESI is a rapidly emerging direct sales company with two main =
divisions- Bayport, Inc. offers a complete line of high-quality products =
for the high growth $52 billion personal care industry- American =
Business Resource Network provides a complete system of educational =
training and instructional seminars to help the nation's 25 million =
small and entrepreneurial businesses.<BR>
<BR>
--EESI is undertaking major growth initiatives which will play out in =
significant near term revenue growth, and leave the Company well =
positioned to emerge as a major player in the $85 billion direct =
marketing industry!!!<BR>
<BR>
A Few Reasons to Own EESI:<BR>
<BR>
1. EESI's Bayport subsidiary is an emerging leader in the $52 billion =
personal care market with a product offering of over 70 high quality =
personal care and health and wellness items.&nbsp; The Bayport line is =
distributed through direct sales, the Internet, infomercials, and trade =
shows.&nbsp; Bayport is completing installation of advanced order =
processing and fulfillment software that will enable it to meet high =
sales volumes, and is developing relationships with outside sales groups =
to ramp sales efforts.&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
2.&nbsp; Bayport is addressing lucrative markets with its personal care =
and health &amp; wellness offerings.&nbsp; Personal care and cosmetic =
care is a $52.7 billion industry that is growing at a CAGR of 5.7%, =
while Bayport's niche markets provide ample growth opportunities (skin =
care is a $19 billion industry, for example).&nbsp; The health &amp; =
wellness industry is estimated at over $59 billion and has been growing =
at a rate of 10% annually, as American consumers seek better health and =
appearance.<BR>
<BR>
3. EESI has created an innovative and unique service offering with =
American Business Resource Network.&nbsp; ABRN will provide three =
complimentary levels of services, a "a "Getting Your Business Started on =
the Right Track" software package which includes all of the forms and =
templates necessary to form a business; a more advanced series of =
educational seminars covering topics relevant to start-up business =
needs; and the National Investment Congress- an organization hosting =
annual conventions to showcase companies for national investment =
exposure and financing.&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
4. There are over 25 million individual and small businesses in the US, =
with over 1 million small business failures each year and a majority of =
new start-ups closing within 5 years due to owner inexperience, lack of =
familiarity with capital structure, and other issues.&nbsp; ABRN is one =
of the first businesses to specifically address this significant market =
opportunity.<BR>
<BR>
5. Direct marketing is a dynamic and explosive growth industry with =
revenues of over $85 billion- in the US alone the industry is expected =
to reach $35 billion by 2005.&nbsp; Increasingly network marketing has =
become popular not just among specialty businesses like Avon and Mary =
Kay, but with corporate America as well.&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
6. EESI has recently launched Telemarkone, a call center and =
telemarketing operation that will provide support for Bayport and ABRN =
operations as well as an additional revenue stream through contracts =
with major corporations.&nbsp; Telemarkone has already signed agreements =
with AT&amp;T Wireless and California Long Distance Co. and EESI =
management estimates that this arm of the Company will add at least $2 =
million in net income over the next 12 months.<BR>
<BR>
7. EESI has a strong and experienced management team with long and =
successful histories in key operating markets.&nbsp; CEO Gary Sherman =
has an extensive investment banking background, while Bayport leaders =
James and Betty Porter have a wide range of experience in the direct =
marketing and personal care industries.<BR>
<BR>
With a strong position in the direct marketing industry, innovative =
operations in personal care/health &amp; wellness, business education, =
and telemarketing, EESI stands poised to see major near term revenue =
growth.&nbsp; EESI is improving its sales infrastructure, and we expect =
to see significant announcements over the next several months.&nbsp; =

We urge you to invest now, and take advantage of this unique opportunity =
to invest in a rapidly growing and soon-to-be profitable new player in =
the direct marketing industry.&nbsp; The best news is that, at its =
current price of $0.04, EESI offers a low risk opportunity to see huge =
trading gains.&nbsp; This stock could reach $0.30 in the next week of =
trading!!!<BR>
