Fatality was not significantly different  Failures were significantly =
more common with combination therapy  Among all trials we found no =
evidence for any potential prevention of infection by resistant isolates =
with combination therapy  <BR>
It can be debated which design appropriately examines the clinical =
interpretation of synergism studies comparing same or different  lactams =
 Synergism has been defined as a 2 log10 or greater reduction in =
bacterial count with the combination versus that with each of the agents =
alone 86 In studies comparing the same  lactam this is directly tested =
but the effect of increasing the antibiotic spectrum cannot be separated =
from a synergistic effect  <BR>
