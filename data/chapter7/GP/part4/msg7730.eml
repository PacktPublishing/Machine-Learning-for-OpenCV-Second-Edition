Digital Color Print, Inc. (&quot;DCPI&quot;), through it's wholly owned =
subsidiary Logical=20
Imaging Solutions (&quot;LIS&quot;), is in the business of supplying =
high-speed digital=20
printing systems and supplies to the commercial printing industry. The =
printing=20
systems are unique in technical concept and application. The systems are =
totally=20
digital, designed to mount on existing offset web presses and =
significantly=20
improve the functionality of the press, not as a replacement - but as an =

enhancement. The printing process is called Electron Beam Imaging =
(&quot;EBI&quot;), and=20
is significantly faster the convention laser printing - the only =
partially=20
competing technology.<br>
<br>
Printing is America's third largest manufacturing industry; employing =
more than=20
1.2 million people in almost 46,000 establishments. The printing =
industry,=20
during 2002, produced over $165 billion of printed products and =
purchased $4.5=20
billion of hardware and $7.7 billion of consumable products.&nbsp; =
NYSE-listed Dover=20
Corporation, the largest manufacturer of offset web presses, estimates =
that=20
there are more than 35,000 presses installed in the U.S., with a press =
costing=20
from $150,000 to several million and using as much as $10,000 of =
consumable=20
products per month.<br>
<br>
Offset presses print all types of documents; forms, labels, tickets, =
tags,=20
advertisements and direct mail pieces, at production rates of 500=20
pages-per-minute (&quot;ppm&quot;) to thousands of ppm. However, the =
printed materials=20
produced are each identical, as each image printed is the =
&quot;offset&quot; inked image=20
derived from the printing plates that are mounted on the offset press. =
The great=20
limitations of the offset process are that each image (page) remains =
identical=20
unless the printing plates are changed. Also the inking of the plates =
requires=20
the laborious tasks of mixing the inks for each plate, inking the plates =
and=20
then cleaning the press for the next job. If the print job requires =
variable=20
information, such as; name, address, bar codes, dates, prices, this must =
be=20
added in a distinctly separate print operation. Typically this task is =
performed=20
by expensive data processing laser printers, manufactured by either =
Xerox, IBM=20
or Oce' (Formerly, Siemens Printing Systems). The laser printers print =
only in=20
black.<br>
<br>
LIS printing systems are designed to mount directly on most offset web =
presses=20
and allow for the printing of any type of data or graphics, without =
limitation,=20
and in line with the offset presses traditional production of a colorful =
end=20
product. As a simple example: In the production of an event ticket such =
as a &quot;Superbowl&quot;=20
ticket, all fixed or non-variable information, such as the =
&quot;colorful=20
photo-quality&quot; front cover and the stadium rules and disclaimers on =
the reverse=20
side of the ticket are produced by plates on an offset press; identical=20
information on each ticket. A second printing process is then required =
to add=20
the variable information, which includes the section, seat and row =
numbers,=20
price and date of the event. This function can be accomplished, in line, =
by an=20
LIS provided system.<br>
<br>
LIS printing systems are entirely digital and are dry &quot;Toner&quot; =
based, which=20
precludes the laborious press set-up and clean-up tasks, ink mixing and =
storage=20
and the production of printing plates. The pressman simply runs the =
paper=20
directly through LIS's printer and it becomes an integral part of the =
press and=20
the starting and stopping of the press and the placement of the digital =
object=20
on the page are all under the control of LIS proprietary software. <br>
<br>
NYSE-listed Dover Corporation, the largest manufacturer of offset web =
presses,=20
estimates that there are more than 35,000 presses installed in the U.S., =
with a=20
press costing from $150,000 to several million and using as much as =
$10,000 of=20
consumable products per month.&nbsp; DCPI's DIGITALCOLORPRESS was =
designed to be=20
installed on the majority of these presses, extending their life and =
utility by=20
providing the printing of computer generated variable data in-line with =
the=20
offset printing function. Further, the system eliminates the need for =
preparing=20
and storing printing plates, and inks and the expensive tasks of setting =
up a=20
press for a print run, followed by tearing down after each job, cleaning =
the=20
press and setting up for the next print job. DCPI estimates that the =
majority of=20
printers will upgrade to color during the first two years of the=20
DIGITALCOLORPRESS availability and thousands more&nbsp; commercial =
printers will=20
purchase systems through DCPI's direct sales force and distribution =
channel=20
during the next two years.<br>
<br>
DCPI's first growth step is to increase consumable inventory to support =
existing=20
LIS systems, each installation generates about $6,000 per month in =
consumable=20
purchases. Secondly, to make LIS's unique color press available from =
inventory=20
and expand the current number of installed sites. Thirdly, make the =
product=20
offering available to the commercial printing industry. Large tasks, but =

currently without any perceived competition or technological =
limitation.<br>
<br>
<i>This stock will see major upward movement in the next several weeks. =
Right=20
now, DCPI is one of the Street's best kept secrets, but it will not =
remain that=20
way for long. This is a unique opportunity to get in while trading =
levels are=20
still low. As the Company goes forward with its business plan and signs =
major=20
new contracts, this stock will move quickly. This is your last chance to =
invest=20
before DCPI begins major price appreciation. This stock could reach =
$3.50 in the=20
next five trading days!<br>
