&lt;p&gt;SAN LUIS OBISPO, CA,, Apr. 30, 2004 (MARKET WIRE via COMTEX) -- =
(TTTP.OB) --<BR>
&nbsp; According to a recent poll, Americans dread blindness more than =
any other disability.<BR>
&nbsp; Recent studies indicate that by the year 2025, the population of =
people over<BR>
&nbsp; the age of 65 in the United States will be six times higher than =
in 1990. The<BR>
&nbsp; reason -- &quot;baby boomers&quot; are aging and overall life =
expectancy is<BR>
&nbsp; increasing. Since many people diagnosed with macular degeneration =
are over age<BR>
&nbsp; 55, the number of cases of macular degeneration in the U.S. will =
increase significantly<BR>
&nbsp; as baby boomers age. &lt;/p&gt;<BR>
&lt;p&gt;Said Carol Slavin, President &quot;The market is very large, =
with about 50<BR>
&nbsp; million AMD sufferers worldwide (15 million in the U.S.) and five =
million new<BR>
&nbsp; cases each year. Less than 2% of all AMD cases are treated =
successfully, so<BR>
&nbsp; an urgent need exists for effective new strategies.&quot; We =
would anticipate<BR>
&nbsp; significant revenues in the millions of dollars as we increase =
our distribution<BR>
&nbsp; capabilities and our VisionKare(TM) brand becomes the =
&quot;benchmark&quot;<BR>
&nbsp; for the industry.&lt;/p&gt;<BR>
