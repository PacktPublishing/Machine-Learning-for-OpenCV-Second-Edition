SN<FONT FACE=3D"Arial"> World Foundation<FONT FACE=3D"Arial"> will =
supply to countries and developing regions the technology and necessary =
support for production in series of Mini-plants in mobile containers =
(40-foot). The Mini-plant system is designed in such a way that all the =
production machinery is fixed on the platform of the container, with all =
wiring, piping, and installation parts; that is, they are fully =
equipped... and the <FONT FACE=3D"Arial">M<FONT FACE=3D"Arial">ini-plant =
