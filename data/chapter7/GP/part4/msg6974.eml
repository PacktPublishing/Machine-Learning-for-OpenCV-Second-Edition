-ARME is a leader in the design, development, and manufacture of "clean =
energy" electrical battery power drive systems for land and marine =
vehicles.=A0 The Company's proprietary Lithium-Ion electric battery =
system provides highly efficient and environmentally clean power capable =
of driving a vehicle at high speeds.=A0 ARME plans to begin marketing =
and distribution of a wide range of electric vehicles utilizing these =
proprietary drive technologies, and will introduce lines of electric =
bicycles, motor scooters, ATV's, and other vehicles from late fiscal =
2004.=A0 <BR>
<BR>
-With manufacturing and distribution channels already in place for major =
markets in Europe, Asia, and the Americas, we believe that ARME is well =
positioned to emerge as a major player in an explosive growth $16.2 =
billion electric vehicle market that is expected to reach $177 billion =
by 2013.</B><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
1.=A0 <B>Armor Enterprises is continuing to enhance its product line =
with new electric vehicles and innovative technologies.</B>=A0 The =
Company has recently acquired the rights to produce and install the =
newest, high tech gas turbine fired generator on all its electric =
vehicles as a modular component.=A0 Inclusion of this system will =
further enhance Armor Enterprises competitive advantage, enabling its =
electric vehicles to safely recharge their batteries on board with low =
pressure hydrogen running a turbine generator- effectively eliminating =
the need for recharging the vehicle's battery while providing additional =
power.=A0 Armor Enterprises is further working to broaden its planned =
product offering with the development of new vehicle systems for its =
technologies.=A0 Most notably, the Company has recently entered into an =
agreement with Nova Communications, manufacturer of a line of innovative =
personal water craft, for joint development of a marine propulsion =
engine.=A0 <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
2. <B>The Company benefits from its strong and experienced management =
team, Board of Directors, and Advisory Board, who have extensive =
experiences in the alternative energy and electric vehicle industries, =
and who have a history of successful tenures at public and private =
companies.</B>=A0 President and CEO Merrill Moses is an experienced =
executive and investment banker, and VP of Operations Ms. Cheryl =
Spousta-Schertzer has extensive senior management experiences in the =
telecommunications and high tech industries.=A0 The Company also =
benefits from having an active Board of Directors and Advisory Board, =
who have been involved in the development of alternative energy and =
electric vehicle technologies for nearly twenty years.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
3.=A0 <B>Armor Enterprises is exceptionally well positioned at the =
forefront of a rapidly growing $16.2 billion electric vehicle industry =
that is expected to reach revenues of $177 billion by 2013!=A0</B> =
Driven by improvements in EV storage and drive technologies, increasing =
government incentives and regulations, and ongoing concerns about the =
environmental and economic impact of reliance on fossil fuels, the =
electric vehicle industry has rapidly grown from little more than a =
curiosity to a multi-billion dollar global business.=A0 In the US alone, =
the EV industry is growing at a CAGR of 27% and is expected to reach =
industry revenues of more than $7 billion by 2005.=A0 With its focus on =
lucrative, mature, and high growth niche markets within the EV industry, =
including motor scooters (a $2.5 billion market in Europe alone), off =
highway motorcycles and ATV's ($20 billion), and personal water craft =
($1.4 billion), we believe that Armor Enterprises has significant =
competitive advantages and early-mover status within this niche =
markets.=A0 <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
4.=A0 <B>Armor Enterprises has received significant interest in its line =
of electric vehicles from major distributors and is currently in the =
testing phase for a number of potential major contract wins.</B>=A0 The =
Company has announced a number of significant negotiations with major =
groups in Europe, Asia, and the Americas for purchase and distribution =
of Armor's line of EV products, and we anticipate that delivery of =
prototype models and testing will serve to validate its offering, =
leading to major contract and distribution agreements over the next six =
months.=A0 The Company has recently undertaken a contract to build and =
deliver prototypes for its electric mountain bike, electric ARV, =
electric go-kart, and neighborhood electric vehicle (NEV) to be used as =
demonstration models for a very large private company.=A0 Armor =
Enterprises has further undertaken negotiations with one of the largest =
go-kart race track consortiums in Europe to provide models of their =
electric go-karts for testing.=A0 We believe that these and other =
testing developments will facilitate the development of widescale =
distribution and sales efforts from late 2004.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
5.=A0 <B>The Company derives significant advantages from its established =
strategic relationship with one of Asia's largest two wheel vehicle =
manufacturers, which will prove an invaluable assistance in rapidly =
ramping up production, building distribution channels, and developing =
new product lines.=A0</B> Strategic alliances and joint ventures are an =
integral component in the Company's business strategy, enabling Armor to =
focus its efforts, capital, and resources on core competencies while =
leveraging the strategic partner's expertise in manufacturing and =
distribution.=A0 The strategic relationship with one of the largest two =
wheeled vehicle manufacturers in the world will provide Armor with =
access to affordable, scalable, and high quality manufacturing and a =
global network of distributors.=A0 This relationship will be provide =
major impetus for the Company's near-term revenue and sales growth, and =
enable the Company to meet aggressive sales targets without the capital =
expenditure normally associated with product development and =
manufacturing.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Armor Enterprises, Inc. (OTC BB: ARME) is a rapidly expanding provider =
of land and marine electric vehicles (EV) utilizing its proprietary =
Lithium-Ion battery storage and drive technologies.=A0 The Company's =
innovative electric battery power drive system can be easily utilized on =
a wide range of vehicles including scooters, mopeds, ATV's, go-karts, =
and water craft, offering tremendous improvements in range and speed =
over competitive electric battery products with significantly improved =
recharge times.=A0 Armor has also recently acquired licensing rights to =
an innovative low pressure hydrogen turbine technology which will enable =
its EV's to safely generate battery power onboard while providing =
additional engine power.=A0 We believe that Armor Enterprises' product =
line of electric vehicles are superior in quality, performance, and cost =
to competitors and further distinguish the Company as a leader in the =
electric vehicle industry.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
We think that ARME is an investment opportunity that cannot be missed, =
and strongly urge you to take advantage of the current pricing levels to =
buy now and see huge short term profits.=A0 With introduction of its =
line of innovative electric vehicles scheduled to begin in late 2004, =
ARME is poised to see major revenues this year!!!=A0 With revenues of =
over $50 million expected for FY 2005, we believe that ARME presents a =
perfect opportunity to invest on the ground floor of the electric =
vehicle boom.=A0 We believe that ARME will see appreciation to levels of =
approximately $5.00 per share within the next twelve months, and the =
stock could reach $1.50 within the next seven trading days!!<BR>
