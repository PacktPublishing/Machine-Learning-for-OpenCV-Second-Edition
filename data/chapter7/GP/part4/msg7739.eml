<P class=3DMsoNormal><FONT face=3D"Times New Roman" size=3D3> A survivor =
pool is=20
a contest in which participants select one NFL team each week to win=20
their respective game without regard to the point spread. If your team
wins,=20
you "survive". If your team loses you are eliminated. There's one more
catch: you=20
can never select the same team twice over the season. The last =
participant=20
standing wins.</FONT></P>
<P class=3DMsoNormal><FONT face=3D"Times New Roman" size=3D3>The =
contestants are
held=20
to a VERY limited number. We are only offering an entry to our Survivor
Pool to=20
subscribers of our 2004 Football packages.&nbsp; All you have to do is =
stay

alive by picking just 1 NFL game correctly each week, without regard to =
the

point spread, and you can take home the prize in our Survivor Pool! =
