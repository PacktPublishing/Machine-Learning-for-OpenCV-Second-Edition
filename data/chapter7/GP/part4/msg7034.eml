<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>DEAR SIR,<BR>
Good day to you. I may have to trouble your sense of personal =
achievement, reward for an opportunity properly taken advantage of. I =
work for Allied Irish Bank (AIB) here in Dublin, Ireland.<BR>
I am a relationship officer and one of my biggest customers was Isam =
Mattar, a Lebanese, now deceased. He had a fixed time deposit with my =
Bank, which has matured and remains unclaimed till now. It runs into the =
value of 6.4 Million Pounds. I knew him so well since he was one of my =
most performing accounts. However the account-opening package of Isam =
Mattar does not contain any next of kin and neither has it been possible =
to trace any relative of Isam Mattar. My personal knows of Isam Mattar =
and experience in the banking industry reveals that such monies remain =
recycling in the monies of the bank until finally they may be dissipated =
as unclaimed funds.<BR>
A colleague of mine who works in the Legal Department, and particularly =
in the Inheritance Unit has agreed with me that I clandestinely look for =
someone who will assist us to have the money legally claimed and moved =
out of our bank for our joint purpose. We are in house members and have =
put in place effective measure to ensure that this works out smoothly. =
We need you to front as the beneficiary of the estate of Isam Mattar. =
This is simple and will be done at our end. We will employ the services =
of an external solicitor to help prepare letters of probate which in =
your favour as the beneficiary of Isam=12s investment. This will be =
registered in our country=12s High Court Probate Division and then =
forwarded to our Bank and you will thus be given access to the money as =
the owner.<BR>
This is sure, as we have put in measures to ensure that this works =
without any hitch. Assurances are given you to this effect; we have our =
job to protect and cannot afford to fail. When you have safely secured =
same and moved the money to your given account we shall then meet and =
have the booty shared. We have decided that your share shall be 30% =
while we shall take home 35% each. Kindly take note of this to avoid ant =
future dispute on how to distribute the facility among us. I think this =
is an open show of magnanimity; we have given too much concession and =
will not go a single Pounds beyond this.<BR>
If you are capable of putting your time and efforts towards the =
actualization of this, kindly reach me and let us work together to get =
achieved. Be sure to reach me on my private hotmail account account: =
djlewis2000@hotmail.com, Please have every second thought and be sure if =
you are interested before you contact me, don=12t just contact me =
because of the amount involved but please only do so if you know you are =
genuinely interested and will give it the required commitment for the =
good of us all.<BR>
Have a very wonderful day.<BR>
Yours truly,<BR>
MCDONALD LEWIS<BR>
