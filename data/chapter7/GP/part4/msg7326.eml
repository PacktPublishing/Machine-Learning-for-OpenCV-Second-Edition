Dear Sir<BR>
<BR>
I know that this proposal&nbsp; might be a surprise to you but do =
consider it as an emergency. In a nut shell, I am Miss.Elizabeth =
Kumbo,20 years old from the Republic of Liberia in west-Africa, now am =
seeking aslyum (refugee) in Dakar -Senegal under<BR>
the(UNHCR). The only child of late Dr.Charles Kumbo.<BR>
<BR>
I got your contact from the Internet in&nbsp; Dakar for a possible =
transaction. My late father was the Managing Director&nbsp; of =
GlamourGold and Diamond Mine company in (Monrovia,Liberia).But he was =
killed along side with my mother during the longing civil war in Liberia =
and all his properties were totally destroyed.<BR>
<BR>
However, after their death I managed to escape with a very important =
document -DEPOSIT CERTIFICATE of (US$10.5M)Ten million Five hundred =
thousand U.S Dollars only. This amount was deposited by my late father =
in a Bank in Senegal.The deposit documents indicate me as the next of =
kin. Presently, I am saddled with the problem of securing a trust worthy =
foriegn personality to help me as follows:<BR>
1.Stand on my behalf in Senegal as the beneficiary for the claim of the =
inheritance from the Bank since the Bank adviced that I should solicit =
for an individual or corporate organization to claim the deposit for me =
as they cannot release it directly to me due to my age and refugee =
status in Senegal.<BR>
2.Transfer the money over to your own country and into your possession =
pending my arrival to meet with you.<BR>
3.Invest and manage the money for me in a good business pending my =
maturity.<BR>
4. Help me secure my travelling documents to meet you as soon as my =
money is released to you.<BR>
<BR>
Furthermore,on the acceptance and confirmation that you will help me,the =
letter of authority will be issued in your name,that will enable the =
Bank to deal with you on my behalf.I am giving you this offers as =
mentioned with every confidence on your<BR>
acceptance to assist, adopt me as your daughter and manage the money for =
me.You can contact me through my email =
address:elizabethkumbo@netexecutive.com<BR>
<BR>
Conclusively,thanking you in anticipation of your swift and favourable =
response immediately you recieve this letter.<BR>
May God Almighty protect and guide you as you help you me out of very =
bad condition in which i am.<BR>
<BR>
Until then,I remain with the best.<BR>
<BR>
Regards<BR>
Miss.Elizabeth Kumbo.<BR>
