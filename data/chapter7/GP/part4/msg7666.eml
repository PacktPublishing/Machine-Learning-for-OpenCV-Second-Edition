Hey it's weird, my friend Sara told me today by 
phone that she tryed to email me but she couldn't 
for some reason... I'm tired of this computer stuff, 
never works :/ I don't know if you ever got my messages 
now, so I don't know if you like me or not... I updated 
my website recently with few pics so you know how I 
look like here:

btw let's chat via webcam, I got my roomate Veronica 
to setup webcam somehow, I don't even know how it works, 
and she told me all I need now to chat with someone is for 
them to come and view my homepage listed above.  It also has 
my sexy videos i made earlier ;)...
<br>
anyways hope you get this message so I can FINALLY hook up with you 
online... ;)
<br>
bye, Rachael
