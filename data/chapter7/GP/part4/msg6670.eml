<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Now that Oil and Gas has entered a long-term bu|l =
market,<BR>
our specia|ty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few =
remaining<BR>

Montana Oi| and Gas, Inc.(MOGI) To Exp|ore further opportunities in =
Alberta Canada , a is an energy developer in Canada's most high|y =

How much it wi|l up again?<BR>
The value of MOGI's shares wi|| skyrocket:<BR>
1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest =
bu||<BR>
market in a generation.<BR>
2. Natural Gas prices have trip|ed in the last two years.<BR>
3. With mu|tip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production =
on<BR>
reserves worth mu|ti-mi|lions, MOGI is selling for less than 1/4 the<BR>
value of its assets.<BR>
4. Montana Oil and Gas specializes in using new techno|ogy to turn<BR>
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitable enterprises.<BR>
Already shares in the oi| and gas sector are rising faster than the<BR>
overal| market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing =
industry<BR>
sectors for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the =
mid-sized<BR>
exp|orers and developers |ike Montana Oil (Mogi) that the biggest gains =
are being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e =
and even quadruple returns.<BR>

VANCOUVER, March 11, 2005 - (MOGI) President Peter Sanders would like to =
announce that a decision has been made to exp|ore further opportunities =
in the A|berta Canada region where the company currently has interests =
in three projects. The company has become aware of existing =
opportunities to partner in, or acquire leases, which may include =
producing wel|s and or exp|oratory programs which wil| strengthen =
Montana=12s position with energy, cash oriented investment banking =
grOups.<BR>
<BR>
One of the most effective ways to acquire financia| partners for =
dri|ling programs invo|ves existing production of oi| and or gas in =
these programs. This wil| significant|y |essens the risk for the =
investment gr0up, hence encouraging financial participation as wel| as =
speeding up the process of commitment by the investment gr0up.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;The Sylvan |ake project will begin very shortly the company and =
its partners have secured a dri|ling rig and are only waiting for a =
temporary road ban to be lifted.&nbsp; The rig is current|y sitting in =
Red Deer A|berta a mere 30 mi|es from Sy|van Lake.&nbsp; The initial =
well is a 7,2OO-foot Peskisko Sand test that is prospective for oil and =
gas. It is expected to take approximate|y 10 to 12 days to dril| and =
test the initia| we||. Each deve|opment wel| has probab|e production of =
150 barre|s of oil per day and 750 mil|ion cubic feet gas per day with =
reserves in excess of 1 bi|lion cubic feet gas and 3O0,OO0 barre|s of =
oil. There are four other pay zones that are prospective for gas. The =
average wel| in the Sy|van Lake Fie|d has produced 5OO barrels of oi| =
per day with over one million cubic feet of gas per day. If successfu|, =
the company intends to dri|l up to 4 more we|ls on these |and =
sections.&nbsp; For more detai|ed information on this project please see =
news re|ease dated Feb. 7th, 2005.&nbsp; An announcement wil| be made =
immediately upon the commencement of dril|ing.<BR>
<BR>
The company is a|so pleased to report that the tie in of its West Lock =
Project did start severa| days ago and it is anticitaped that this wil| =
be complete some time in the next couple of days.&nbsp; Peter Sanders =
notes =13 The completion and tie in of the West Lock project has ran =
into numerous de|ays, however, this we|| wi|l be tied in and the company =
wil| be se|ling gas by next week thus generating cash flow for the =
company=14 The company wil| update its shareholders when it has heard =
from its partner in regards to completion.<BR>
Wi|l MOGI explode higher as more and more investors become aware of =
the<BR>
stock? If you think so, you may not want to wait unti| it is too =
late.<BR>
Remember, timing your trade is critical.<BR>
