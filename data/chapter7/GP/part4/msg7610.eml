   To truly hear you must quiet the mind.    There are three ways to =
obtain wealth: inheritance, luck, and hard work. None is guaranteed, but =
you have no influence over the first two.    There is a magnet in your =
heart that will attract true friends. That magnet is unselfishness, =
thinking of others first. When you learn to live for others, they will =
live for you. (Paramahansa Yogananda)    No one would remember the good =
Samaritan if he had only good intentions. He had money as well. =
(Margaret Thatcher)    Cheerfulness is contagious, but don't wait to =
catch it from others. Be a "carrier".    Sign at animal shelter, =

   Some people complain because the roses have thorns.   Sticks and =
stones can break my bones, but words can shatter my soul.    =
Confrontation doesn't always bring a solution to the problem, but until =
you confront the problem, there will be no solution. (James Baldwin)    =
Relationships can be boring - not people!    Not everything that counts =
can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts. (Sign =
