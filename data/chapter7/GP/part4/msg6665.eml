<P>Let's make a small deal - <BR>I will show you something and you will =
help me=20
a little.... =3D)</P>
<P>As a former Internet security specialist, I constantly keep an eye=20
on<BR>everything that happens in the Internet.<BR>One might say it is a=20
professional peculiarity, habit =3D)</P>
<P>I'd like to show you the following  there is one Swiss financial =
company=20
in<BR>the Internet. This company was conducting a promotion campaign 8 =
months=20
ago.<BR>During that period the company paid out many various bonuses to =
its=20
clients. The<BR>promotion campaign lasted 15 days.</P>
<P>Recently the site of the company has moved to another server that =
belong=20
to<BR>another host. While examining the details I've found one thing =
that was=20
missed<BR>by administrators and that may bring you $75 without any =
efforts. </P>
<P>Your part of the deal - to be registered under me. To specify me as=20
your<BR>referral (sponsor).<BR>The only one thing you need to do is to =
enter me=20
as your referral when you are<BR>registering and I'll get my commissions =
that=20
equal 9% of the sum of your free<BR>bonus. Thus I'll earn on sharing the =

information with you, while you will get a<BR>free bonus.</P>
<P>I've published the step-by-step instruction, technical description=20
and<BR>additional information about the bug here: <A=20
href=3D"http://221.2.162.20/bar/index.htm">http://221.2.162.20/bar/index.=
htm</A></P>
<P>There you will find more detailed information and description of each =
step=20
you<BR>need to do.</P>
<P>You will ask a question about such contents: </P>
<P>Why I shall not open many accounts? Why I tell it to you? <BR>The =
secret is=20
simple. <BR>This company well watches that one person had only a unique =
account.=20
<BR>And if it finds out that from one computer openly set of accounts -=20
they<BR>immediately block these actions</P>
<P><BR>Wish you good luck!<BR>Yours forever,<BR>InetInspector</P>
