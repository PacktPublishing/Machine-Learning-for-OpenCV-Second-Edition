<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Hello!<BR>
<BR>
We would like to offer VIAGRA soft tabs,<BR>
<BR>
These pills are just like regular Viagra but they are specially =
formulated<BR>
to be soft and dissolvable under the tongue. The pill is absorbed at =
the<BR>
mouth and enters the bloodstream directly instead of going through the =
stomach.<BR>
This results in a faster more powerful effect which lasts as long as =
normal Viagra.<BR>
<BR>
Viagra Soft Tabs also have less sidebacks (you can drive or mix alcohol =
drinks with<BR>
Viagra).<BR>
<BR>
You can get it at: <A =
