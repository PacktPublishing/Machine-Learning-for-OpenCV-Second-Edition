<DIV>Dear Webmaster,</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>We run several websites offering accommodation services in Europe =
and I thought you might be interested in Exchanging Links with us. =
Exchanging Links can bring both of us mutual benefits i.e. increased =
traffic to our websites.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>We provide several travel-related sites. All of them are Page Rank =
5 or 6. Our links pages have page rank from 2 to 5.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>If you are interested please contact me.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>If you got this message in error please forward this mail to your =
webmaster.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I look forward to hearing from you.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
