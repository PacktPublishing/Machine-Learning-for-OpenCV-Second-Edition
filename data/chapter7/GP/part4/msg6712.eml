Young Hopeful: &quot;Father, what is a traitor in politics?Father (a =
veteran<BR>
politician): &quot;A traitor is a man who leaves our party and goes over =
to the<BR>
other one.&quot;Young Hopeful: &quot;Well then, what is a man who leaves =
his party and<BR>
comes over to yours?&quot;Father: &quot;A converter, my son.&quot;<BR>
German scientists dug 50 meters down and discovered small pieces of =
copper.<BR>
After studying these pieces for a long time, Germany announced that =
the<BR>
ancient Germans 25,000 years ago had a nation-wide telephone net. =
Naturally,<BR>
the Russian government was not that easily impressed. They ordered their =
own<BR>
scientists to dig even deeper. 100 meters down they found small pieces =
of<BR>
glass and they soon announced that the ancient Russians 35,000 years =
ago<BR>
already had a nation-wide fiber net. American scientists were outraged =
by<BR>
this. They dug 200 meters down &amp; found absolutely nothing. They =
happily<BR>
concluded that the ancient Americans 55,000 years ago had cellular<BR>
telephones.<BR>
