You're able to download dvd movies, console games, music.&nbsp; Ive =
downloaded 9 dvd's so far.<BR>
Be sure and let me know once you've seen it - you're going to flip.<BR>
Theres a few pages in there on how to get your selection on CD if you =
need the help.<BR>
My favorite part is the movies area, theres movies listed in here for =
download that are still in theaters - plump crazy :)<BR>
I'll talk to you later.<BR>
