<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;From Mr I.Kamara<BR>
<BR>
TEL +27 83 486 2761<BR>
<BR>
DEAR ,<BR>
<BR>
This letter was borne out of my sincere desire to establish a<BR>
business/mutual relationship with you. I got your contact through =
the<BR>
international trade and commerce (ITCC).<BR>
<BR>
My name is Ibram Kamara the son of late Chief Abraham P.Kamara (the =
former<BR>
<BR>
deputy minister of finance under the ousted civilian government) who =
was<BR>
<BR>
killed and mutilated by the military junta led by major, Paul Koroma =
after<BR>
<BR>
overthrowing the elected government of president Tejan. Through, I do =
not<BR>
<BR>
know to what extent you are familiar with events and disturbance in<BR>
Sierra-Leone but the pressure of war drove my mother and I out of =
Sierra<BR>
<BR>
-Leone into exile in South Africa where we have been living under =
political<BR>
<BR>
asylum for years.<BR>
<BR>
Sadly, my mother died of cancer 2 months ago and was buried here in =
South<BR>
<BR>
Africa . Prior to her death, she handed me over a certificate meant =
for<BR>
a<BR>
secret deposit, which my father made in a security/finance company in =
europe<BR>
<BR>
the deposit that worth US$25,000,000 ( Twenty five million U.S =
dollars)<BR>
this<BR>
was the money paid to his corporation by it's overseas customers in =
the<BR>
heat<BR>
of the conflict. He made the deposit in his name and also deposited it =
as<BR>
a<BR>
family tresures, with the hope of converting it to his personal use at =
the<BR>
<BR>
end of the war but he was killed when the conflict intensified as a =
result<BR>
<BR>
of his opposition to the rebel forces. I have contracted the<BR>
Security/finance Company to confirm the deposit and establish =
ownership.<BR>
<BR>
Due to the death of my Mother, I have decided to solicit for the<BR>
participation of an honest and trustworthy person or company that =
will<BR>
assist in acting as my representative who will jointly signed the =
agreement<BR>
<BR>
for the safe keeping of the money in the security/finance company. =
The<BR>
security/finance company don't know the content of the consignment, =
they<BR>
<BR>
believe that it is African artefact. As contained in 2 trunk boxes.<BR>
Unfortunately, My mum who is surpose to assist me in releasing the<BR>
consignment has died of cancer that is why I am looking for your =
assistance.<BR>
<BR>
I cannot do it alone due to my present social status and total =
ignorance<BR>
of<BR>
the business world. I shall also give you 20% of the funds for your<BR>
assistance to relocate this fund to your country and for re-investment =
while<BR>
<BR>
the rest will be kept in any account of your choice for inverstmant =
purpose.<BR>
<BR>
i would have done the transfer myself as my name is written as the =
next<BR>
of<BR>
kin,but because of my present status in this country as a refugee i =
will<BR>
not<BR>
be allowed to handle such money or else it will be confisticated by =
the<BR>
<BR>
goverment if found in my possetion,and also i will not be allowed to =
open<BR>
an<BR>
account as a refugee not even to talk of inversting such an amount =
of<BR>
money,these are the reasons why i need your assistance,If you are =
interested<BR>
<BR>
in helping me out of this my present situation, contact me =
immediately<BR>
through my email and i will funish you with other details you need =
to<BR>
conclude this transaction.this transaction is absolutely risk free and =
of<BR>
<BR>
biliteral benefits as i have all neccesray legal documents backing =
it<BR>
up.please get back to me with your full name,tel.no fax no and also =
your<BR>
<BR>
home addres so as to enable me introduce you to the security/finance =
company<BR>
<BR>
handling the consignment as my representative.after all these you will =
then<BR>
<BR>
make an arrangement on how we are going to meet face to face and =
discuss<BR>
in<BR>
details.<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, I cannot travel out because i have no travelling documents =
for<BR>
<BR>
now,i also hope that after everything you will secure a visa for me to =
join<BR>
<BR>
you in your country so that i can continue my studies over there. I =
hope<BR>
to<BR>
hear from you soon<BR>
<BR>
Best regards,<BR>
MR IBRAM KAMARA<BR>
