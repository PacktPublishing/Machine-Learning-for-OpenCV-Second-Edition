<DIV>With oil prices now well over $50 and near-constant international=20
instability highlighting the vulnerability of the US and world economies =
to=20
petroleum supply shortages, the use of renewable, alternative energy =
sources has=20
taken on new and immediate importance.&nbsp;.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV><BR>Some of the most widespread and feasible of these new =
technologies are=20
already being incorporated into everyday usage- foremost among these is =
the use=20
of ethanol fuel as an oxygenator in petroleum to reduce emissions and as =
an=20
alternative fuel source.&nbsp; Ethanol is already blended in =
approximately 30%=20
of US gasoline as an environmental additive, while the use of RFG =
(reformulated=20
gasoline) could more than double demand.&nbsp; According to industry =
estimates,=20
in 2004 the use of ethanol fuel helped to reduce the average cost of =
gasoline by=20
nearly 30 cents per gallon, while it reduced over 7 million tons of=20
CO2-equivalent greenhouse gas emissions.&nbsp; Government regulatory =
measures=20
including EPACT and Clean Air Standards, as well as new policies banning =
the use=20
of MTBTE are acting as a major catalyst towards ethanol industry growth- =
with an=20
estimated 3.4 billion gallons used in the US in 2004, demand is expected =
to=20
skyrocket to more than 12 billion by 2010.</DIV>
<DIV><BR>In spite of this tremendous and growing demand, however, there =
is a=20
significant and serious ethanol supply crunch- driving up prices of =
ethanol on=20
the open market, spurring major government interest and Wall Street=20
investment.&nbsp; Ethanol production has traditionally been a costly and =
complex=20
endeavor, requiring heavy subsidies to coax producers to ramp up their=20
operations to meet demand.&nbsp; There are currently 81 ethanol plants =
in the=20
US, capable of producing 3.6 billion gallons annually- a figure that is =
barely=20
adequate to meet current demand, let alone keep up with future =
demand.&nbsp; The=20
ethanol industry is struggling to meet this demand with 16 additional =
plants and=20
an annual capacity of 800 million gallons already under =
construction.&nbsp; It=20
is no surprise then, that the Street is eagerly awaiting new investment=20
opportunities in the ethanol and clean energy industries- a trend which =
has been=20
validated by the recent high-profile $250 million merger of Pacific =
Ethanol,=20
Inc. (NASDAQ: PEIX) with Accessity Corp.to form the first US-based =
pure-play=20
