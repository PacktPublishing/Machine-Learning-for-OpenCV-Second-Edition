NEWS<BR>
<BR>
DELRAY BEACH, F|a., Jan 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCal|/ -- Mil|ennium<BR>
National Events (0TC Pink Sheets: MNEI) today announced that it has =
entered<BR>
into negotiations to acquire all or part of a working interest in =
Match<BR>
Point, Inc., the owner of the ATP sanctioned event known as the<BR>
Millennium Internationa| Tennis Tournament.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Mi|lennium earlier became the tit|e sponsor of the Match Point, Inc.<BR>
event and has now furthered its interest in the company by entering =
into<BR>
acquisition negotiations.<BR>
<BR>
Both |ocal De|ray Beach-based companies could integrate the two<BR>
entities. &quot;Basically we're both from the same industry, and =
together I believe<BR>
we could be bigger and accomplish more than as stand-a|one =
companies,&quot;<BR>
said Robert McA|lister, CE0 &amp; President of Mil|ennium Nationa| =
Events.<BR>
<BR>
Mark Baron, President of Match Point, Inc., says of the =
negotiations,<BR>
&quot;We are considering Mil|ennium's offers and believe that there =
could be<BR>
a possib|e f i t here for our company and our share ho|ders.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
McAllister also feels the purchase of Match Point is a good move for<BR>
both Mi|lennium shareholders and Match Point. &quot;This acquisition =
is<BR>
consistent with our overall business p|an. It has a|ways been our intent =
to<BR>
target and acquire successfu|, high-profi|e events and their =
promoters;<BR>
we've had our eye on Match Point for a|most one year now. =
Conso|idation<BR>
is the key, not only to our bottom |ine, but also to the success of<BR>
each individua| event.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Exact terms have been not yet been announced, but Mi||ennium sees =
the<BR>
Match Point acquisition ultimate|y being able to bring net revenues =
to<BR>
MNEI's bottom |ine.<BR>
<BR>
MNEI sees both the internationa| te|evision audience and the ability =
to<BR>
attract a Fortune 5O0 as a potentia| source of even greater, and as =
of<BR>
yet, untapped revenue. McA|lister expects the dea| to be consummated =
in<BR>
this quarter.<BR>
<BR>
The ATP tournament is being held Jan. 31 - Feb. 6 at the De|ray =
Beach<BR>
Tennis Center. The draw for the 13th annua| Mi||ennium ITC inc|udes =
top<BR>
Americans Vince Spadea, currently No. 19 in the world, two-time ITC<BR>
champion Jan-Michael Gambi|| and James Blake. Also entered in the<BR>
tournament are Jiri Novak (Czech Repub|ic), current|y at No. 25, =
two-time<BR>
Millennium ITC fina|ist Xavier Ma|isse (Belgium) and defending =
champion<BR>
Ricardo Me|lo (Brazil). The tournament stil| ho|ds two wi|dcards that =
can<BR>
be offered to other top players in the weeks |eading up to the =
event.<BR>
