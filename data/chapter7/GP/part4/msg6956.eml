<p> One day a genie appeared to a California man and offered to grant =
him one wish.<br>
the man said:" I wish you'd build a bridge from here to Hawaii so I =
could drive there anytime"<br>
The genie frowned" I don't know. It sounds like quite an undertaking," =
he said. "Just think of the logistics. The supports required reaching =
the bottom of the ocean, the concrete, and the steel! Why don't you pick =
something else?"<br>
The man thought for a while and then said, "Okay, I wish for a complete =
understanding of women- what they are thinking, why they cry. I wish I =
knew how to make a woman truly happy".<br>
The genie was silent for a minute, then said<br>
"So how many lanes did you want on that bridge?"</p>
