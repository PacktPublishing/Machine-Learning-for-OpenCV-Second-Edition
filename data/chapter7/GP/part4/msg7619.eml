<br>Get your facts first, and then you can distort them as much as you =
please.



We are born to action and whatever is capable of suggesting and guiding =
action has power over us from the first.
<BR>Charm is more than beauty.
<BR><BR>He that lives to forever, never fears dying.<br><br>A =
Constitution should be short and obscure.<br>By the year 2000 we will, I =
hope, raise our children to believe in human potential, not God.

<BR><BR>Tribulation will not hurt you, unless as it too often does it =
hardens you and makes you sour, narrow and skeptical.



<br><br>If honesty did not exist, we ought to invent it as the best =
means of getting rich.


<br>The difference between greatness and mediocrity is often how an =
individual views a mistake...

<br>Possession is nine tenths of the law.

Action is the product of the qualities inherent in nature.Man loves =
company, even if it is only that of a smoldering candle.One who does not =
know when to die, does not know how to live.



Men are able to trust one another, knowing the exact degree of =
dishonesty they are entitled to expect.



Architect. One who drafts a plan of your house, and plans a draft of =
your money.



<BR>What monster have we here? A great Deed at this hour of day? A great =
just deed -- and not for pay? Absurd -- or insincere?


<br>Love expands.

<br><br>A man can do only what a man can do. But if he does that each =
day he can sleep at night and do it again the next day.
