<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>FROM:TUKUR MANA,<BR>
FEDERAL SECRETARIAT COMPLEX,<BR>
IKOYI.<BR>
EMAIL :t_mana@fsmail.net<BR>
<BR>
Best wishes of good health and success in your pursuits particularly =
through my proposal as contained in this letter.Before going into =
details of my proposal to you, I must first solicit you to treat this =
with utmost confidentiality, as this is required for its success.<BR>
<BR>
INTRODUCTION:<BR>
My colleagues and I are senior officials of the Federal Government of =
Nigeria=12s Contracts Review Panel who are interested in investing some =
funds that are presently floating in the accounts of the Central Bank of =
Nigeria. In order to commence this transaction, we solicit your =
assistance to enable us transfer into your account the said floating =
funds.<BR>
<BR>
We are determined to conclude the transfer before the end of this =
quarter of 2003. The source of the funds are as follows: During the last =
military regime,government officials awarded contracts that were grossly =
over-invoiced to Contractors.The present civilian government set up the =
Contract Review Panel, which has the mandate to use the instruments of =
payments made available to it by the decree setting up<BR>
the panel, to review these contracts and if necessary pay those who are =
being owed outstanding amounts. My colleagues and I have identified =
quite a huge sum of these funds which are presently floating in the =
Central Bank of Nigeria ready for disbursement and would like to invest =
some of it for our own purposes.<BR>
<BR>
However, by virtue of our positions as civil servants and members of =
this panel,we cannot acquire these funds in our names or in the names of =
companies that are based in Nigeria. I have therefore been mandated, as =
a matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel, to look for a reliable =
overseas partner into whose account we can transfer the sum of Sixteen =
million,five hundred thousand U.S. Dollars That is why I am writing you =
this letter.<BR>
<BR>
We have agreed to share the money to be transferred into your account,if =
you agree with our proposition as follows; (i) 10% to the account owner =
(you). (ii) 80% for us (the panel officials). (iii) 10% to be used in =
settling all expenses (by both you and us )incidental to the =
actualisation of this project. We wish to invest our share of the =
proceeds of this project in foreign stock markets and other business =
till we are<BR>
ready and able to have access to them without raising any eyebrows here =
at home.<BR>
<BR>
Please note that this transaction is 100% safe . We intend to effect the =
transfer within fourteen(14) banking days from the date of receipt of =
the following information: Your name, company=12s name, address =
,telephone and fax numbers . The above information will enable us write =
letters of claim and job description respectively. This way, we will use =
your company=12s name to apply for the payment and backdate the award of =
the contract to your company. We are looking forward to carrying out =
this transaction with you and we solicit your utmost confidentiality in =
its execution.<BR>
<BR>
Please acknowledge the receipt of this email by replying urgently. =
Also,endeavour to furnish me with your phone number so that I can call =
you and bring you into a more detailed picture of this transaction when =
I hear from you.<BR>
<BR>
Best regards,<BR>
<BR>
Dr Tukur Mana.<BR>
