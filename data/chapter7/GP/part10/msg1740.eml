statement contained herein will be or can be achieved, any one of those =
factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those =
projected herein. These forward-looking statements include plans and =
objectives of management for future operation, including plans and =
objectives relating to the products and the future economic performance =
of the company. Assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments =
with respect to, among other things, future economy, competitive and =
market conditions, future business decisions, and the time and money =
required to successfully complete development projects, all of which are =
difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are =
beyond the control of the company. Although the company believes that =
the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements contained =
herein are reasonable, any of those assumptions could prove inaccurate =
and, therefore, there can be no assurance that the results contemplated =
in any of the forward-looking statements contained herein will be =
realized. Based on actual experience and business developments, the =
impact of which may cause the company to alter its marketing, capital =
expenditure plans or other budgets, which may in turn affect the =
company's results of operations in light of the significant =
uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statement included herein, =
the inclusion of any such statement should not be regarded as a =
representation by the company or any other person that the objective or =
plans of the company will be achieved.</p>=20

Double Stock Reporter (DDSR) profiles are not a solicitation or =
recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. DDSR is not offering =
securities for sale. All statements and expressions are the sole opinion =
of DDSR and are subject to change without notice. The companies that are =
discussed in this opinion have not approved the statements made in this =
opinion. This release may contain statements that constitute =
forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the =
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E the Securities =
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The words "may" "would," "will," =
"expect," "estimate," "anticipate," "believe," "intend," and similar =
expressions and variations thereof are intended to identify =
forward-looking statements. Investors are cautioned that any such =
forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and =
involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Company's =
ability to control, and that actual results may differ materially from =
those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of various =
factors. This profile is not without bias, and is a paid advertisement. =
DDSR is not liable for any investment decisions by its readers or =
subscribers. DDSR is not a registered broker dealer or investment =
advisor. It is strongly recommended that any purchase or sale decision =

of any financial regulatory bodies. The information contained in DDSR =
profiles is provided as an information only service. The accuracy or =
completeness of the information is not guaranteed and is only as =

lose all or a portion of their investment if they make a purchase in =
CYPM. DDSR has been compensated eight hundred thousand free trading =
shares of CYPM by JJ Consulting, a non-affiliated third party. THE =
READER SHOULD VERIFY ALL CLAIMS AND DO THEIR OWN DUE DILIGENCE BEFORE =
INVESTING IN ANY SECURITIES MENTIONED. INVESTING IN SECURITIES IS =
SPECULATIVE AND CARRIES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK.  We encourage our readers =
