<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>MR FRANCIS OMA<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
ATTN: DIRECTOR /CEO,<BR>
<BR>
A CRY FOR FAMILY HELP.<BR>
<BR>
I am Mr Francis Oma the first son of the late Mr. PETER OMA. my father =
had served mr B.h. Lions who was an irish citizen and a successful =
farmer in our remote village. my father served him for many years and =
inherited his farm after his death. My father became an executive member =
of the farmers Association in the western mashonaland province of =
Zimbabwe. He also became a successful businessman, because of the recent =
uprising in my country and the war veterans and farmers clashing,my =
father decided that it would be safer if my younger brother and I move =
to south Africa to escape the violence.<BR>
<BR>
We left Zimbabwe with two boxes containing the sum of US$11.5M (Eleven =
Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars Only) and valuables =
(Diamonds)worth US$5M. My father has instructed us to deposit it with a =
private security company on our arrival.<BR>
<BR>
He also instructed me not to reveal the contents of the box to anyone =
for security reasons and All the documents pertaining to this =
deposition.<BR>
<BR>
Barely two months after we moved to johannesburg,we got information that =
my father's farm had been invaded and that my parent and most of his =
workers had been killed. My father's property and farmland have now been =
taken over by the war veterans.<BR>
<BR>
I believe that this has been the work of people who did not like my =
father because of white owned farms. we could not even attend the =
funerals of my parents as we also now fear for our dear lives.<BR>
<BR>
0ur reason for contacting you is to seek for your assistance in =
providing an overseas bank account where we can transfer this fund. Have =
in mind that this is a risk free business as we have conclude a modality =
for the transfer. Your participation gives you 20% of the total sum, 7% =
for all expense in curred during this business while 73% is for my =
younger brother and I. The Diamond will be discussed at our arrival.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
We do not know much about diamonds or how to invest this money so we =
will also need your assistance in this regard.We have agreed to give you =
a share of the money if you are willing to assit us, should this =
proposal meet your utmost consideration,please do not hesitate to =
contact my brother or me on the above email address.<BR>
<BR>
The confidentiality of this proposal cannot be overemphasized as we =
believe that you will oblige with us the needed security and attention =
it demands.Please treat this proposal with the utmost regard,and the =
confidentiality of these business should not be over-emphasised.<BR>
<BR>
Please response on this email address; francisoma@zwallet.com<BR>
Waiting for your favourable response.<BR>
Thanks and god bless,<BR>
<BR>
(From Mr Francis Oma).<BR>
