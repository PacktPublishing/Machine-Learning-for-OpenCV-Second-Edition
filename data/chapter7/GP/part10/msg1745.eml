Letter of Intent for $2,000,000 from a Major Motorcycle Aftermarket =
Vendor</strong></font></p>
=20
<p>RONKONKOMA, NY: March 29, 2004; Perma-Tune Electronics, Inc., a =
wholly-owned subsidiary of Trans Max Technologies, Inc., (OTCBB:TMXT), =
today announced the signing of a Letter of Intent with a Major =
Motorcycle Aftermarket Vendor to distribute Plasmatronics' (a division =
of Perma-Tune Electronics, Inc.) Plasma Drive Ignition System.  The =
Letter of Intent will be converted to an order within approximately 45 =
days. The Letter of Intent is for a minimum of 2,000 units and =
represents sales of approximately $2,000,000.</p>=20

<p>The Motorcycle Aftermarket Vendor will be purchasing specially =
configured and manufactured Plasma Drive Ignition Systems. The Plasma =
Drive Ignition system is a new kind of ignition that can either be used =
by Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) or aftermarket vendors.  Tests =
show significant increases in fuel mileage and an increase in horsepower =
and reducing harmful emissions.  This product is currently in =
production.</p>  =20

<p>Said Lonnie Lenarduzzi, President and Chief Scientist for =
Plasmatronics, a division of Perma-Tune Electronics, Inc., "To =
understand what we've done with the Plasma Drive Ignition, you must =
throw out everything you knew about motorcycle ignition. This =
revolutionary compact motorcycle ignition system is a completely new way =
of achieving incredibly efficient combustion. Using never-before =
exploited principles of physics, the PDI produces a cleaner burn than =
ever before possible, converting nearly all available fuel, whatever it =
may be, to torque. This process results in a thrilling, measurable =
increase in performance, dramatically better fuel economy and as a =
result, reduced emissions."</p>=20

<p>Trans Max Technologies, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary =
Perma-Tune Electronics, Inc. through its Plasmatronics division is a =
developmental Company engaged in the automotive and marine electronics =
industry and has several cutting edge products that were recently =
introduced at the Miami International Boat Show. This press release =
contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private =
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In particular, when used in =
the preceding discussion, the words "believes,'' "expects,'' "intends,'' =
"will,'' "anticipated,'' or "may,'' and similar conditional expressions =
are intended to identify forward-looking statements within the meaning =
of the Act and are subject to the safe harbor created by the Act. Except =
for historical information, all of the statements, expectations and =
assumptions contained in the foregoing are forward-looking statements =
that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. It is possible that =
the assumptions made by management are not necessarily the most likely =
and may not materialize. In addition, other important factors that could =
cause actual results to differ materially include the following: =
business conditions and the amount of growth in the company's industry =
and general economy; competitive factors; ability to attract and retain =
personnel; the price of the Company's stock; and the risk factors set =
forth from time to time in the Company's SEC reports, including but not =
limited to its annual report on Form 10-KSB; its quarterly reports on =
Forms 10-QSB; and any reports on Form 8-K. Trans Max Technologies Inc. =
takes no obligation to update or correct forward-looking statements and =
also takes no obligation to update or correct information prepared by =
third parties which is not paid for by the Company.</p>=20

				<p>TMXT is a rapidly emerging player in the multi-billion dollar =
specialty electronics arena.</p> =20

<p>TMXT's heralded product line possesses a myriad of significant =
performance, durability and price advantages that appeal to a diverse =
range of automotive, boating and trucking segments.</p> =20

<p>Interestingly, according to management, yearly numbers for engine =
manufacturing are 12,000,000 for the domestic auto industry and 125,000 =
for the marine industry. TMXT estimates the domestic market to be =
conservatively in excess of $2,000,000,000 for OEM ignition systems.</p> =


<p>These projections do not include foreign sales, which are recognized =
as being approximately double domestic sales. TMXT's other products are =
a bit more difficult to project. No other products exist in these =
categories so a somewhat conservative approach has been factored in =
TMXT's projections.</p> =20

<p>To project this first year, start-up numbers, TMXT has made several =
assumptions: TMXT will occupy its new factory with controlled conditions =
for sales and production; necessary personnel will be on board; and, a =
dynamic new marketing phase will be launched for its new products, =
including advertising and promotion.</p>

<p><font color=3D"#006633">Management estimates that in the first year, =
it is reasonable to expect sales to come approach 4,000 units. Average =
price per unit is approximately $650, for gross sales of $2,600,000.  =
TMXT's other products are to contribute approximately $2,000,000 to =
first year sales. Gross profit margins are projected to range from 30% =
to 75% depending on the order size and purchaser.</font></p>=20

<p><font color=3D"#006633">TMXT projects in the near future to capture =
3% of the combined projected market. This could equate to sales of =
$120,000,000.</font></p>

<p>To round out its dazzling display of products and services, TMXT =
plans to unveil its FLAT PANEL DISPLAY:  Perma-Tune Electronics is =
currently designing a revolutionary new touch-screen, flat-panel pilot =
instrumentation display for the marine industry.  The panel will be =
fully visible in all light conditions, including direct sunlight.</p>=20

<p> A wide variety of engine performance parameters can be =
simultaneously monitored by the pilot, while concurrently displaying =
global positioning, sonar and radar data.  This one central display =
simplifies the pilot's job and un-clutters the dashboard.  Bulky, =
failure-prone wiring harness bundles can be eliminated with this =
product, since a single RS-232 computer cable connects the engine =
management system to the display.</p>=20

<p>Additional devices can be connected with a single RS-232 computer =
cable.  Indeed, we're talking of a highly-fragmented environment, with =
such players as: Crane Ignition Systems, Seamens Ignition Systems, =
Delphi Ignition Systems, Saab Motor Company, Motorola Ignition Systems, =
Bosh and MSD.  Such quality names appear to soon be joined by TMXT as it =
unveils its unparalleled proprietary technologies.</p>                   =

				<p>TMXT is poised to embark on a period of seemingly unbridled =
growth as it furthers its expansion as a leader in electronic ignition =
and ignition-based products for the automotive, boating and trucking =

<p>TMXT's products appear to be welcome solutions for the age-old =

U.S. stock exchange to further attract both retail, as well as =
institutional interest.  With an effective and diversified cutting-edge =

compensated there is an inherent conflict of interest.
