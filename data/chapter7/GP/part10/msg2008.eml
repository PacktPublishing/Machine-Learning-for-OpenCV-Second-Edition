<b>STOP SPAM FOREVER!!</b><p>

Hello, <br><br>

This thing really works.<br>
Do you find yourself consistantly adding your email address to ton's of =
spammers "remove me" lists?
<br>I know I did. I tried out this software (the ad and link which I =
have included at the bottom of this email) and I haven't gotten an =
unwanted email in weeks. This program worked wonders for me. If you hate =
Spam like I do, you owe it to your self to
try this program, and forward this email to all of your friends which =
also hate Spam or as many people possible.<br><br> Together lets help =
clear the Internet of Spam!<br>
<br>Hope this helps,<br>Rodney Greenwald<br>

TRACKS!

Ask yourself these 3 questions:
<br><br>
1)Do you get junk, scams and worse in your inbox
every day?
<br>

2)Are you sick of spending valuable time
removing the trash?
<br>
3)Is your child receiving inappropriate
adult material?
<br><br>
<b>If so</b> you should know that no other solution works
better then our software to return control of your
email back where it belongs!
<br>
Imagine being able to read your important email
without looking through all that spam... <p>
