<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>hello, I am from Switzerland and you'll don't believe =
me,<BR>
but a trojan horse in on your computer.<BR>
I've scanned the network-ports on the internet. (I know, that's =
illegal)<BR>
And I have found your pc. Your pc is open on the internet for =
everybody!<BR>
Because the smss.exe trojan is running on your system.<BR>
Check this, open the task manager and try to stop that!<BR>
You'll see, you can't stop this trojan.<BR>
When you use win98/me you can't see the trojan!!<BR>
<BR>
On my system was this trojan, too!<BR>
And I've found a tool to kill that bad thing.<BR>
I hope that I've helped you!<BR>
<BR>
greets</FONT>
</P>
