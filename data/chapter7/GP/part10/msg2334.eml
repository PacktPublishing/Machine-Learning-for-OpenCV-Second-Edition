Needle Pricks Key Danger to Doctors and Nurses<BR>
<BR>
AIDS and Hepatitis C<BR>
Today, AIDS and Hepatitis C are an important concern for doctors and =
nurses in the operating room, the emergency room and all over the =
hospital, especially when handling any type of contaminated =
needles.&nbsp; Suture needles account for a whopping 40% of all needle =
sticks, a very dangerous environment for doctors and nurses.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The Problem<BR>
<BR>
20 Million people worldwide have died from AIDS.<BR>
40 million people are infected with HIV outside the U.S.<BR>
25% of all HIV infected Americans don't even know they have it.<BR>
4 million people in the U.S alone have Hepatitis C.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
SutureMate - The Solution<BR>
<BR>
The Suture Mate is designed to facilitate the safe handling of sharp =
medical instruments as mandated by OSHA Directive CPL 2-244D and the =
federal Needle-stick Safety Act.<BR>
<BR>
Designed and developed by Dr. Michael Swor, MD, it is a disposable =
surgical device that has been clinically proven to reduce glove =
perforations by 60-80%, and percutaneous injuries by 70%. In other words =
this surgical devise helps prevent the transference of these highly =
contagious diseases.<BR>
<BR>
