            <strong>AngelCiti</strong> Entertainment, Inc. licenses =
online gaming
            software to online casinos. While online gaming has =
experienced torrid
            growth the continued massive worldwide penetration of the =
internet
            and the growth of high-speed access ensure that this =
industry will
            be a hotbed of growth for years to come. Anglesite is =
pursuing a two-pronged
            strategy to best take advantage of this market opportunity: =
(1) aggressively
            marketing AngelCiti's licensed software, and (2) pursuing a =
classic
            roll-up strategy by adding additional casinos and casino =
software
            companies.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>AngelCiti's Operations</strong><br>
            <br>
            <strong>AngelCiti</strong>'s casino customers work just like =
the live
            land based casinos you might play at in Las Vegas, Atlantic =
City or
            on a riverboat in the Mississippi. They offer standard =
casino games
            including Blackjack, Roulette, Craps, 10 different types of =
Slot Machines,
            Caribbean Stud, Video Poker, Keno, Baccarat, Pai Gow Poker, =
Let &#8216;em
            Ride, and many more, with the same true odds that would be =
expected
            in a live casino. Player&#8217;s simply sign-up, deposit =
money into
            their account via credit card, Western Union, bank wire, =
Netteller,
            or through another form of accepted payment and within =
minutes they
            can be playing on the net. It&#8217;s fast, easy to use, =
secure and
            people get the opportunity to play from the comfort of their =
own home.<br>

            <br>
            <strong>AngelCiti</strong>&#8217;s marketing strengths are =
key toward
            the overall growth and development of the company. Their =
management
            staff has been involved in online gaming since its inception =
and the
            company&#8217;s related affiliate program, =
CasinoPaycheck.com has
            proven to be key in driving traffic to =
<strong>AngelCiti</strong>'s
            customer licensees.<br>
            <strong>AngelCiti</strong> also maximizes its contacts and =
relationships
            in hiring experienced third-party advertising purchasers as =
outside
            contractors. <strong>AngelCiti</strong> has moved =
aggressively to
            assist its licensees in acquiring customers to ensure strong =
bonds
            and long lasting relationships with its customers.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Management</strong><br>
            <br>
            Mr. Guttierez has recently taken the helm as President &amp; =
CEO,
            at <strong>AngelCiti</strong>. Mr. Gutierrez has a wealth of =
experience
            in the online gaming industry having served as president of =
Commercial
            LT Baroda, SA (CLTB) a medium-size data processing company =
in the
            gaming industry, providing call center set-up, 24-hour =
customer service,
            and general operations management, for the past 4 years. Mr. =
Gutierrez
            has also served as the CEO of Kailuamana SA, a company, =
which provides
            investment banking services to micro-cap companies.<br>
            <br>
            Mr. Ward, a corporate vice president and treasurer has =
worked hand
            in hand with Mr. Gutierrez growing CLTB to a handle several =
hundred
            million last year. Mr. Ward handles the day-to-day money =
management
            and accounting functions and has been involved in the online =
gaming
            area since its inception.<br>
            <br>
            Mr. Wei Hsin Lee, for the newly created position of Chief =
Operating
            Officer to help manage its ongoing growth and expansion. =
Prior to
            coming on board with <strong>AngelCiti</strong>, Mr. Lee was =
the founder
            and president of Web Venture Asia, a management consulting =
services
            company providing business development expertise to =
technology and
            gaming-related companies. Previously Mr. Lee had worked in =
senior
            level positions in Japan, China and the United States, and =
has been
            integrally involved in the online gaming industry since its =
inception.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Competition</strong><br>
            <br>
            There is already significant competition in the marketplace =
given
            the popularity of the Internet in general and the relatively =
low overhead
            associated with Internet gambling. However, we anticipate =
that <strong>AngelCiti</strong>'s
            management expertise combined with its access to capital as =
a public
            company will be inherent advantages to help it gain and =
maintain a
            competitive advantage in the industry to maintain our =
superiority
            in the industry.<br>
            <br>
            Anyone can operate a website; the key is driving traffic to =
the website
            and converting that traffic into players. Casino on Net and =
Golden
            Palace are two of the larger private operators in the online =
casino
            industry. They have done a very good job in marketing their =
own sites,
            but they have not gone into the marketplace to acquire other =
online
            casinos. <strong>AngelCiti</strong> can use its stock as =
capital to
            acquire other online casino software companies and the =
casinos that
            use their products in their operations to rapidly grow the =
company.
            Moreover, because this industry is highly automated, =
<strong>AngelCiti</strong>'s
            acquisition campaign can enable it to continue to reduce =
general and
            administrative costs as a percentage of operations.<br>
            <br>
            It is generally agreed, that the large land-based US casinos =
will
            eventually enter the online casino fray. However, they have =
been hesitant
            to move into this industry due to the enormous capital =
investment
            they have in their gaming licenses and land-based =
infrastructure.
            However, there is also a strong belief that the US =
government will
            recognize its inability to abolish the industry and will =
attempt to
            move in and regulate it. As the large US casinos such as =
MGM, Harrah&#8217;s,
            and the like, enter the online industry, we believe that =
<strong>AngelCiti</strong>
            will be an attractive buyout candidate as a result of our =
experience,
            database and corporate exposure as a public vehicle. </font> =

            <font color=3D"#68685B">While the U.S. has been the dominant =
market for the Internet to date,
            statistics from Nua Ltd. indicate that approximately 25 =
percent of
            Internet users are from Europe and 15 percent are from the =
Asia Pacific.
            Estats, Inc., on online provider and assembler of the =
Internet research,
            believes that the major international growth areas will be =
in Europe,
            led by Germany, the UK, Sweden, France, Asia/Pacific Rim, =
especially
            Japan, Australia, Taiwan, and New Zealand. Western Europe, =
with 14
            million people online, accounting for 18% of the =
world&#8217;s total,
            represents the next big growth opportunity of the net. Asia, =
led by
            Japan, is a booming market for online users, e-commerce and =
advertising
            dollars. Estats, Inc. further estimates that Asia and the =
Pacific
            Rim region hold 8 million of the world&#8217;s net users, =
nearly 11%
            of the world&#8217;s total. According to Paul Budde =
Communications
            the online population in Asia, estimated at 5 to 10 million, =
comprises
            only 0.4% of the total population in that region. Due to the =
population
            of Asia versus its lack of online household penetration, the =
long-term
            potential for growth is astronomical. The Baker Report was =
quoted
            as saying, &#8220;We believe our projections of Internet =
gambling
            revenues of US$100 to US$200 billion domestically and US$200 =
to US$400
            billion in the rest of the world by 2005 is reasonable, even =
conservative.&#8221;
            In an Aug. 1 PRNewswire - First Call press release - =
AngelCiti Entertainment,
            Inc. announced that it will be initiating operations of a =
Chinese
            based language online casino, and will be adding additional =
Asian-language-based
            websites, entering Asia's multi-billion dollar gaming =
market.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Additional Growth Potential</strong><br>
            <br>
            It is universally agreed that the next big evolution is the =
adaptation
            of the wireless Internet and most professionals predict this =
will
            occur over the next several years. Moreover, online gambling =
has continued
            to grow internationally as even more people gain access to =
the internet.
            These events will materially increase our opportunities to =
reach the
            gaming public and convert even more users toward =
AngelCiti&#8217;s
            licensed Casinos.<br>
            <br>
            With regard to wireless growth, AngelCiti&#8217;s licensed =
casinos
            can acquire more online game time from users waiting to =
catch their
            planes, which are delayed for appointments, and the like, by =
providing
            them with the easy use of our entertainment over their cell =
phone
            or wireless PDA. Moreover, they can acquire additional users =
in the
            form of computer phobic people who feel perfectly =
comfortable using
            their mobile phone. We strongly feel that the next =
generation of wireless
            products will serve to only further fuel the meteoric growth =
of the
            online gaming industry and that AngelCiti&#8217;s licensed =
casinos
            will enjoy the fruits of that evolution.<br>
            <br>
            The market for online gaming in Europe and Asia has been =
growing even
            more rapidly than the US market an In a April 29, 2002 =
Business Week
            article noted that &#8220;All over Europe, Internet surfers =
are visiting
            gambling and gaming sites in record numbers, helping online =
betting
            become one of the fastest growing businesses on the =
Net.&#8221; And
            yet the online casino providers catering to these markets =
have grown
            more slowly than those servicing English-speaking countries. =
To keep
            up with growing international demand, AngelCiti has plans to =
bring
            out online casinos in Spanish, German, French and Chinese =
within the
            next 6 months and will explore adding on additional =
languages as those
            markets continue to grow. AngelCiti has also expressed a =
strategy
            of maximizing its marketing capabilities by bringing on =
specialists
            familiar with those regions who can help us to optimize our =
website
            design and marketing efforts with a special local flavor =
tailor-made
