<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Dear Sir/madam,<BR>
<BR>
I am Brother Titi Camara, the son of Late Director of Finance, =
Dr.Mohammed Camara of Sierra Leone Diamond and Mining Corporation. I am =
contacting you from GHANA.On behalf of my widowed mother Mrs, Mariam =
Camara wish to solicit your assistance in transferring the sum =
US$15.5miilion (fifteen Million Five Hundred Thousand United States =
Dollars only) to your bank account. My late father diverted the above =
mentioned money meant for the purchase of ammunitions for my country =
during the peak of a disastrous war in Sierra Leone The said money was =
lodged in a Bank in GHANA through the help of the bank manager.After the =
death of my father, we were advised by the Bank Manager to seek the help =
of a Foreign Partner who can receive this money in our behalf for =
investment purposes.<BR>
<BR>
Now the war in Sierra Leone is over with the help of United Nations and =
ECOMOG soldiers, the present government of Sierra-Leone has revoked the =
passport of all officers who served under the former regime and now ask =
Countries to expel such person at the same time freeze their account and =
confiscate their asset, it is on this note that I am contacting you, all =
I needed from you is to furnish me with your bank particulars:<BR>
1. Account name<BR>
2. Account number<BR>
3. Bank address, telephone and fax numbers for immediate transfer of the =
fund into your bank account.<BR>
I am compensating you with 30% of the total amount, now all my hope is =
banked on you and I really wants to invest this money in your country, =
were there is stability of Government, political and economic =
welfare.<BR>
<BR>
Honestly, I want you to believe that, this transaction is real and never =
a joke. The photocopy of the Certificate of Deposit issued to my late =
father by the bank on the date of deposit is still intact with us, for =
you to be clarified because, I do not expose my self to anybody I see, I =
believed that you will be able to keep this transaction secret for me =
because this money is the hope of our life, hope you understand. Please =
contact me immediately you have gone through this mail, fell free and =
make it urgent. That is the reason why I offered you 30% of the total =
amount.<BR>
<BR>
N/B: As soon as this money is transferred to your account, I shall make =
arrangements to come to your country with my mother for you to advice us =
on a profitable business that we can be able to invest this money =
because I believe you know more that us. Transferring of this money to =
your account can take only four (10) working days. As soon as we hear =
from you, we are going to commence action towards transferring this =
money to your bank account.<BR>
<BR>
Further information and arrangements will commence as soon as =
trust,confidence and good relationship are established. I shall be most =
grateful and appreciative if you could maintain the confidentiality in =
this matter even if you don't want to assist us. Looking forward for =
your respond.Please your reply should be on my alternative =
email:(t_camara66@sino.net) for more details.<BR>
