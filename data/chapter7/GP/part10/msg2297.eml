DEAR SIR,&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
I am the former adviser on arms and acquisition to the current president =
of Haiti, his Excellency President Jean Bertrand Aristide<BR>
<BR>
Following the rebel uprising and a bloody revolt on February 5 led by =
Serge Gilles which is on till date, his Excellency delegate me to =
arrange for arms purchase from Netherlands through independent arms =
dealers. I was directed for arms worth thirteen million five hundred =
thousand united states dollars (US$ 13.5 M). On arrival in Netherlands, =
I defected to the rebels' side and declined to go back to Haiti. I =
decided to divert this fund, which was brought through a diplomatic =
means and deposited in a security house here in Netherlands and declared =
it to be an official consignment belonging to my foreign affiliates.<BR>
<BR>
Currently, this proposal is to inform you that I want to transfer into =
any of your personal account or company's account within the shortest =
possible time for safekeeping. Please note that this transaction demands =
the highest degree of trust and confidentiality between us, moreover, =
it's a risk free in sense that I have taken proper care of all =
formalities regarding it.<BR>
<BR>
In appreciation of your assistance, I have worked out the sharing ratio =
for this transaction as follows 23% for your effort (help and =
assistance) and shall set aside 7% for all incidental expenses, while =
70% shall be for my investment in your country under your close =
supervision and direction.<BR>
<BR>
Be informed that all communication on this transaction shall be kept =
strictly confidential and be kind to send your reply through the above =
email address, ( emmanuelclaude@zwallet.com )<BR>
<BR>
Awaiting your favorable response.<BR>
<BR>
Kind Regards,<BR>
<BR>
Emmanuel Claude Duvalier<BR>
