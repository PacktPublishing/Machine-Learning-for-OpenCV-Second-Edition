&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>

PEDIATRIC PROSTHETICS MARKET<BR>
<BR>
Children ages 0 to 14 comprise $100 million of the total $2 billion =
national<BR>
prosthetic market.&nbsp; The vast majority of this pediatric prosthetic =
market<BR>
derives from infants born with a limb loss.<BR>
<BR>
This infant prosthetic segment allows PDPR to generate a consistent =
revenue<BR>
stream from childhood to adulthood.&nbsp; Revenue from infancy to =
adulthood is<BR>
anticipated to be over $200,000, with adults spend an additional =
$200,000.&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Medicaid and other insurance companies will be funding more than 70 =
infant<BR>
prosthetic fittings this year, which will create annual positive revenue =
for<BR>
PDPR of nearly $1.5 million<BR>
<BR>
1. Of these 70 infant fittings, each year each child will need a =
re-socket<BR>
re-build generating $630,000 annually.&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
2. Every third year these same 70 fittings will need a completely =
new<BR>
prosthetic limb again generating $1.5 million for PDPR.<BR>
<BR>
3. The total revenue generated from these initial 70 fittings, from =
infancy<BR>
to adulthood, is approximately $14 million!<BR>
<BR>
This &quot;annuity effect&quot; will compound earnings each year and =
enable PDPR to<BR>
enjoy stable growth and profitability over the short and long term.<BR>
