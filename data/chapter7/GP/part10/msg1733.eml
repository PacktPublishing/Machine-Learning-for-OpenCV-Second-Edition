				<p>Telecommunication Products Inc (OTCBB: TCPD) is a provider of =
high end digital satellite television, high-speed Wireless Internet =
services to the hospitality and multi-dwelling unit (MDU) marketplace. =
It is focused on expanding on its current 8,000 room pay per view video =
on demand product, to include services to multi-dwelling -units (MDU's), =
both to the US, and international markets. The company has partnered =
with Echostar, a world leading provider of programming, to deliver this =
next generation of home viewing and entertainment service.</p>

<p><font color=3D"#009966" size=3D"2" face=3D"Arial, Helvetica, =
sans-serif"><strong>THE MULTI-DWELLING UNIT MARKET.</strong></font></p>
=20
<p>The total number of MDUs in the United States exceeds 26 million =
units. The Yankee Group has estimated that the potential revenue =
opportunity for supplying video, data and voice services to U.S. =
residential MDUs to be about a $200 billion annual revenue =
opportunity.</p>
=20
<p>A number of factors contribute to the emergence of this enormous =
opportunity. First, the "monopoly" providers, such as cable television =
operators, whom have historically served this market, are using outdated =
analog technology for the most part. Thus, there have been limited =
digital cable services available to the residents living within these =
buildings. Second, the relationships between the property owners and =
managers that control access to these properties and the monopolistic =
suppliers providing the service have been significantly strained over =
the past 15 years. Third, advancements in communications and information =
technology have created an enormous demand within these properties for =
new state-of-the-art services, such as digital satellite television and =
high-speed Internet services. Fourth, a significant regulatory shift has =
created an environment where competition is fostered and encouraged.</p>
=20
<p><font color=3D"#009966" size=3D"2" face=3D"Arial, Helvetica, =
sans-serif"><strong>THE RESORT/HOSPITALITY MARKET</strong></font></p>

<p>TCPD's wholly-owned subsidiary, The Hotel Movie Network (HMN), =
currently services over 50 hotels and 8,000 rooms nationally and =
internationally to guests. The Company has consistent revenues from =
these properties and the relationships with the property owners allows =
us to vertically integrate services to their properties. Whether is be =
digital cable, high speed internet services, or Wireless Fidelity =
(Wi-Fi).</p>

<p><font color=3D"#009966" size=3D"2" face=3D"Arial, Helvetica, =
sans-serif"><strong>COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES</strong></font></p>

<p>Through its acquisitions, Telpro can can supply the hardware, without =
any downtime, to support services more than 100,000 guest rooms at =
approximately half of the current industry average installation cost per =
room. Leveraging its existing assets and installation expertise, =
deployment time is estimated at less than 90 days from a contract =
signature.
With a typical hotel contract having a duration of five years, =
management expects to breakeven in its first year and generate =
increasing profits each year thereafter.</p>

<p>Telpro and HMN contract directly with hotel properties (chain, =
franchise and independent) to operate the digital entertainment and =
Internet systems for their properties. Company products are fully =
integrated with the hotel's Property Management (PMS) and Back Office =
Billing Systems, which manage collection, minimize administration and =
optimize revenue for both Telpro and their customers. Direct access to =
such an intricate part of the hotel operation allows Telpro to have =
direct debit in the hotel accounts to insure compensation for all =
utilized services.</p>

<p>Telpro has also developed an innovative third party royalty model =
that ensures the Company, its partnered movie studios and client hotels =
receive revenues that offset their costs and provide operational =
profit.</p>

<p><font color=3D"#009966" size=3D"2" face=3D"Arial, Helvetica, =
sans-serif"><strong>MULTIFOLD GROWTH STRATEGIES</strong></font></p>

<p>Telpro is embarking upon a systematic growth strategy in order to =
accelerate revenues and achieve positive cash flows and earnings in the =
near future.</p>
=20
<p>With an established customer base of over 8,000 rooms, Telpro =
currently enjoys an immediate revenue flow of $75,000 per month. The =
Company plans to pursue additional, complementary acquisitions in order =
to rapidly build its customer base. <p>Telpro has signed a letter of =
intent with In Room Video, which would add roughly 10,000 additional =
hotel rooms, translating to approximately $100,000 more in revenues per =
month.</p>

<p>Concurrently, Telpro is engaging in contract negotiations for a =
further 5,000 rooms that would extend Telpro's market share in Puerto =
Rico and the U.S. Virgin islands. These contracts consist of mainly =
free-to-guest or pay-per-stay services which would deliver a revenue =
increase of $100,000 per month upon deployment.</p>
=20
<p>Once it has significantly grown its customer base, Telpro plans to =
rollout additional guest entertainment products that would create =
incremental revenues per room, per month.</p>
=20
<p>To assist in its sales efforts, the Company plans to establish =
strategic sales partners to create an additional channel for generation =
of sales revenue. Telpro has identified Property Management Systems =
(PMS) Software Providers as an immediate and qualified sales channel. =
Cost of sales can be reduced as the PMS Software Providers eliminate the =
time-consuming sales qualification process and leverage their existing =
customer base to close contracts for guest's entertainment.</p>
=20
<p>In addition to capturing share in the small-to mid-sized market for =
its VOD services, the Company has entered the exciting, high-growth =
market of wi-fi. In the fourth quarter of 2003, Telpro entered into an =
agreement with Network Installation Corp., a total IT Solutions provider =
that designs, deploys and services traditional communications networks =
as well as wireless networks and wi-fi solutions. Through this =
relationship, Telpro now offers its customers wi-solutions. In turn, =
Telpro has been named the primary provider of visual technology =
solutions for NIC projects.</p>=20

another with NIC to deliver wi-fi solutions, Telpro is well-positioned =
