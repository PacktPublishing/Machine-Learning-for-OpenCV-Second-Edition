<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>HAVANA SPECIALIST HOSPITAL<BR>
134B Off Bode Road.<BR>
Surulere-Lagos. Nigeria.<BR>
Attention:<BR>
&nbsp; My Dearest,<BR>
I have a business proposal, which I know might interest you.<BR>
My name is Dr.Gabriel Uche Bola, a medical doctor and<BR>
a worker of the above specialist hospital. I have a widow<BR>
here in my clinic who is on a political asylum in Nigeria<BR>
Refugee Camp, she has been so ill for some couple of months now.<BR>
This woman confided in me based on the free medical attention<BR>
I have been giving to her and her children.She had revealed to me<BR>
of her life history and about her late husband who was a top =
military<BR>
officer in one of the West African country (Sierra-Leone) before his<BR>
death during the civil war and the fortune she inherited from his =
late<BR>
husband. She has asked me to source a credible and trustworthy<BR>
partner abroad who will manage her funds for investment,the sum<BR>
of Five Million US Dollars (US$5m) which her late husband<BR>
deposited in a safe Fiduciary Agent based in Madrid Spain. I wish<BR>
to choose you for this venture and I believe you will be in the =
position<BR>
to assist in managing and investing this large sum in a profitable =
venture<BR>
and also to help create a safe heaven for her and her children by =
making<BR>
a residence arrangement for them in your country. After she had<BR>
disclosed this information to me, I saw the reason to request from =
her<BR>
to allow me see he documents relating to this deposit of which she =
did.<BR>
I am obliged to assist this lady knowing too well that she has a =
limited<BR>
knowledge in the business world and as such she can not manage this<BR>
funds herself and in Africa in order to avoid any trace of her by =
the<BR>
government, I will need from you a mutual understanding and then we<BR>
shall make plans on how the funds would be secured into an account =
in<BR>
your name; after which you will arrange and travel immediately to =
meet<BR>
with the security company Agent for clearing. This amount is =
contained<BR>
in a sealed trunk box and it is registered and declared as containing =
family<BR>
treasures, so even as I am writing you now the security company Agent =
is<BR>
not aware that there is cash money in the trunk. Let me assure you that =
this<BR>
transaction is 100% hitch - free and risk - free. From my discussion =
with her,<BR>
she has agreed to give you a reasonable amount of percentage for =
your<BR>
involvement in this and this has to be discussed upon the receipt of =
your<BR>
quick response. Thanks and God bless you for your understanding.<BR>
Sincere regards,<BR>
&nbsp;Dr. Gabriel Uche Bola<BR>
