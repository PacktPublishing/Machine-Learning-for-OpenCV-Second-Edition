A Hollywood producer ws determined to give his mother a birthday present
that would be better than any his brothers were giving her. He heard =
about
an amazing bird which could talk in twelve languages and sing ten famous
operas. he immediately bought the bird and sent it to his mother. It =
cost
him $50,000.The day after her birthday, he phoned his mother. "What did =
you
think of the bird, Mother?" he asked eagerly. his mother replied,
"Delicious!"<br>
One day a man went into a chemist's shop and said, "Have you anything to
cure a headache?"The chemist took a bottle from a shelf, held it undert =
he
gentleman's nose and took out the cork. The smell was so strongthat =
tears
came into the man's eyes and ran down him cheeks."What did you do that =
for?"
he said angrily, as soon as he could get back his breath."but that =
medicine
has cured your headache, hasn't it?""You fool." said the man, "It's my =
wife
that has the headache, not me".<br>
German scientists dug 50 meters down and discovered small pieces of =
copper.
After studying these pieces for a long time, Germany announced that the
ancient Germans 25,000 years ago had a nation-wide telephone net. =
Naturally,
the Russian government was not that easily impressed. They ordered their =
own
scientists to dig even deeper. 100 meters down they found small pieces =
of
glass and they soon announced that the ancient Russians 35,000 years ago
already had a nation-wide fiber net. American scientists were outraged =
by
this. They dug 200 meters down & found absolutely nothing. They happily
concluded that the ancient Americans 55,000 years ago had cellular
telephones.<br>
