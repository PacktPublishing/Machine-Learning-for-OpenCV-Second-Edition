				<p>CINM is a wireless services company and creator of =
PocketCinema&#8482; multimedia.   The Hollywood-based studio produces =
downloadable video, applications and graphics for a global audience. =
CINM was founded by filmmaker James F. Robinson in 1999 and is based at =
the Los Angeles Center Studio complex in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>CINM owns what is believed to be the world's largest library of =
multimedia & graphic content for mobile devices, with a focus on global =
distribution of advanced mobile data services. Mobile data services are =
key to network operators as they work to capitalize on new high-speed =
networks and the current boom in color mobile phones sales. CINM =
produces their multimedia content in a wide variety of mobile formats, =
to optimize the user experience and value. The content is customized for =
Nokia, Motorola, Seimens, Sony Ericsson, Samsung, LG and other popular =
handsets.</p>



<p><font color=3D"#009966" size=3D"2" face=3D"Arial, Helvetica, =
sans-serif"><strong>The Market for Mobile Multimedia and Value Added =
Services</strong></font></p>

<p>The telecom industry has invested heavily in high-speed wireless =
(cellular) networks, and in the sales and marketing of color multimedia =
mobile phones. These next-generation mobile phones are experiencing =
impressive growth in mature markets as users "trade up" to color =
terminals and add services like picture messaging and video downloads.  =
In addition, developing territories such as Eastern Europe, India and =
China are adding first-time mobile subscribers in dramatic numbers, many =
of whom are starting out with multimedia enabled phones.</p>=20

<p>These new mobile phones are important to mobile network operators =
(carriers) in that they facilitate in the development of data sales =
growth to complement a mature voice communication business.  Mobile =
phone manufacturers such as Nokia, Sony Ericsson, Panasonic, Seimens, =
Motorola and Samsung, are betting heavily on consumer&#39s migration to =
Multimedia Messaging Services (MMS) and color phones as the standard, in =
much the same way as color screened PCs are the standard today.</p>=20

<p>Forrester Research predicted Multimedia Messaging Services (MMS) =
revenues of USD $2 billion in 2003 and USD $48 billion in 2006. These =
new graphics delivery systems allow users to enhance their text messages =
with graphics, animations, small video clips and audio.  Juniper =
Research has estimated that MMS revenues will reach USD $8.3 billion by =
2004. USD $5.6bn is expected to be generated by third party content =
delivery of the kind of content the Company produces.</p>

<p>According to Industry estimates, there are currently more than 1.3 =
billion mobile phone subscribers globally.</p>

<p><font color=3D"#009966" size=3D"2" face=3D"Arial, Helvetica, =
sans-serif"><strong>PocketCinema&#8482; and CinemaElectric&#39s Products =
and Services</strong></font></p>

<p>CINM produces digital multimedia content that is to be distributed to =
a global audience of mobile consumers. The products allow users to =
personalize their phones and enable them to communicate via new =
technologies like MMS and Video Messaging.  CINM has a significant =
library of formatted mobile multimedia, believed to the industry&#39s =
largest.  Each month, more than 1200 content items are released for =
distribution to a global network of mobile operators, portals and =
handset manufacturers.</p>=20

<p>These products range from downloadable digital motion pictures =
(PocketCinema&#8482;) to animated MMS and screensavers, wallpaper and =
applications that provide new multimedia ?pushed" to the consumer.  CINM =
currently offers it&#39s content in six lifestyle-branded ?channels" as =
follows:  PORTABLE HOLLYWOOD (celebrities), ACTION SPORTS (extreme =
sports), ELECTRIC CATWALK (fashion and style), POCKET GIRLS (models), =
MOVIE MESSAGES (electronic greetings) and WALLPAPERS AND SCREENSAVERS =
(customizing graphics).</p> =20

<p>CINM is currently in talks with several large entertainment brands =
and expects to make announcements soon regarding agreements to adapt and =
release these brands via CINM&#39s global distribution network.</p>

<p><font color=3D"#009966" size=3D"2" face=3D"Arial, Helvetica, =
sans-serif"><strong>Business Model and Scalability</strong></font></p>

<p>CINM product is currently sold via one of three business models: =
PER-DOWNLOAD, SUBSCRIPTION and via MOBILE APPLICATIONS such as =
I-Mode&#8482; , JAVA&#8482;, Symbian&#8482; or BREW&#8482;.  Generally =
these models are operated on a revenue-share model or a flat =
fee-per-download model.</p>

<p>Retail prices paid per-download range from USD $1.5 (and more) in the =
UK to less than $0.15 in Southeast Asia.  The medium price is approx. =
USD $1.00 per download.  CINM collects a portion of the retail price via =
revenue share agreements with operators, manufacturers and =
resellers.</p>

<p>CINM has built what is believed to be the mobile industry&#39s =
largest multimedia distribution network. In Q1, 2004, the Company&#39s =
content and services are expected to be actively distributed in 5 =
continents and 36 countries (USA, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, UK, Ireland, =

<p>&#8220;Based on the continued growth of color multimedia mobile phone =
sales, and the continuing advancement of billing and delivery technology =
within the mobile industry, the Company makes the following =
estimates:</p>=20

<p>The Company anticipates total mobile multimedia (graphics, video and =
audio files) revenues (including content and data fees) to reach $300 =
million at the end of 2004. Out of that, 15% of the revenues ($45m) are =
expected to be content fees for services such as 3rd party audio, videos =
and graphics, of which approximately 20% of that amount will be paid to =
content owners ($9m). The Company expects to capture up to 6% of this =
market with its video, graphics and application services, despite the =
expectation that the majority of revenue will be dedicated to audio =
downloads (audio ringers).</p>=20

<p>Mobile multimedia revenues for 2005 are anticipated to pass the one =
billion dollar mark catering to an audience of 175m global users. The =
Company anticipates capturing up to 7% of this market based on the =
leverage of its distribution network to attract new popular brands, and =
the acquisition of companies with complementary technology and business =
models, provided the Company can raise the required expansion =
capital.</p>=20

<p>The Company anticipates the market will grow by the end of 2006 to =
more than 250 million "mobile multimedia subscribers" and that graphics, =
motion MMS and video will dominate the industry. The Company anticipates =
total mobile multimedia (graphics, video and audio files) revenues in =
2006 to reach $2.8 billion as usage becomes commonplace and sponsored =
mobile multimedia dominates over the pay-per-download model. Out of a =
total global market of $2.1b, it is anticipated that 35% ($735m) will be =
content services revenue, of which approximately 20% will be paid to =
content owners ($147m). The Company anticipates capturing up to 8% of =
this market in 2006.</p>=20

<p>These projections are dependent on the company raising significant =
operating capital in 2004 for marketing and sales expenses, expanded =
production, brand licensing, and acquisitions.&#8221;</p>
