One morning, on my daily walk, a car stopped alongside me and the =
woman<BR>
driver asked,&quot;Can you do me a favor?&quot;&quot;Yes, what is =
it?&quot; I replied&quot;Please tie<BR>
my son's tie,&quot; she asked. &quot;It's his first day at school. I'm a =
single mother<BR>
and I don't know how to do it.&quot;The boy got out of the car, and we =
all stood<BR>
on the street corner, teaching and learning tie knotting.<BR>
Before traveling to London on business, an American drove his Rolls =
Royce<BR>
to a bank in the middle of New York to ask for a loan of $5000. He left =
his<BR>
rolls-Royce as collateral. The loan officer accepted and had the car =
driven<BR>
down into the the bank's underground car park for safekeeping. He =
then<BR>
handed the businessman $5000.Two weeks later, the American came back =
from<BR>
London and he went to the bank to return his loan and bring back his =
car.<BR>
&quot;That will be $5000 plus $15.40 in interest,&quot; said the loan =
officer. The man<BR>
wrote a cheque and started to walk away.&quot;Wait a minute, sir&quot; =
said the bank<BR>
man. &quot;While you were away, I discovered that you are a millionaire. =
Why in<BR>
the world do you need to borrow $5000?&quot;The man smiled. &quot;Where =
else in New<BR>
York could I park my Rolls-Royce for two weeks for only =
$15.40?&quot;<BR>
