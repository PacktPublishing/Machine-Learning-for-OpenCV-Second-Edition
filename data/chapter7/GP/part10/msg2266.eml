competitive advantages in the areas of telecommunications acquisition =

Communications, Inc. (OTC Bulletin Board: <a =

target=3D"_blank">News</a>), announced today that they have entered into =
their third agreement of 2004 with Sky Link of Madrid. The agreement =
will significantly boost Spantel's presence in the Spanish capital in =
both voice and Internet services. Sky Links has primarily focused on =
Internet services, and their expertise is expected to be pivotal in =
promoting Spantel's wholly owned ISP subsidiary Spansurf.</p>

<p>Spantel will also market many of their services to Sky Links =
customers as well as route all voice traffic through Spantel. Spantel's =
president, Jose Ramon Basterra, explained, "We are very happy that =
months of negotiations are finally coming to fruition. Many of the =
alternative carriers continue to contact Spantel with proposals that =
could greatly enhance our overall financial position in the coming =
years. We are evaluating all of these opportunities and are aggressively =
pursuing those that will give us an immediate or enhanced presence in =
areas we have targeted for expansion."</p>

<p>Spantel has entered into agreements with three alternative carriers =
this year and are continuing to pursue negotiations with others. As a =

				    Jose Ramon Basterra, President of Spantel, commented, "The =

"Going forward, we plan to expand the practices we successfully applied =
