<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Market Mover Stock Report's Last Pick (CWTD) exploded =
from $1.19 to<BR>
$9.20, a gain of over 670% in 5 days (Feb 12 - 17)!!!<BR>
<BR>
Here is our NEXT HOT PICK which we feel is the most undervalued =
stock<BR>
we have ever featured and should outperform all other picks this =
year<BR>
based on their sales figures (incl. a backlog of over $100 Million),<BR>
incredibly solid numbers, and low outstanding share total.<BR>
<BR>
Life Energy and Technology Holdings, Inc.<BR>
(OTCBB: LETH)<BR>
Current Price: 1.85<BR>
Near-Term Target: 7.00<BR>
Projected High for '04: 15.00<BR>
<BR>
We are sending this URGENT INVESTOR BULLETIN REVEALING THE MOST<BR>
UNDERVALUED STOCK ON THE OTCBB to our millions of subscribers for =
substantial<BR>
profits immediately!<BR>
Sales orders received by LETH exceed $150 Million over the past year<BR>
while major news was just released that adds multi-millions to the =
bottom<BR>
line. LETH has experienced a recent spike in price and volume<BR>
indicating heavy accumulation of shares which is a sign of even bigger =
things to<BR>
come for this emerging world leader in the conversion of waste<BR>
materials into electrical energy, an industry with such high global =
demand that<BR>
it is impossible to assign a value to the size of the market.<BR>
<BR>
Solving a Dual Crisis - Waste and Energy:<BR>
<BR>
LETH is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their =
Biosphere<BR>
Process System to generate revenue from the disposal of a wide =
variety<BR>
of waste products at 5 to 7 tons per hour which makes a major impact =
on<BR>
the global waste problem. This profitable and environmentally safe<BR>
process converts into clean, &quot;green&quot; electricity such waste =
materials as<BR>
Municipal Solid Waste, agricultural wastes, forestry wastes, medical<BR>
wastes, industrial wastes, sewage sludge, shale oil, sour natural gas, =
and<BR>
the huge market of used tires. LETH profits from the sale of<BR>
electricity created from the waste conversion on a continuous basis by =
generating<BR>
5 to 10 mega-watts per hour of electricity which is then sold to<BR>
replenish the local or national grid.<BR>
<BR>
(Mar 3 '04) LETH Releases Major Product Delivery and Net Profit News<BR>
<BR>
LETH delivered 12 Biosphere Process Systems which resulted in a net<BR>
profit of $3.5 Million, the equivalent of .12 cents per share. LETH =
is<BR>
scheduled to receive an additional $7 Million translating into an<BR>
additional .24 cents per share which is the balance of this completed =
contract<BR>
over the next 6 months. The net profit per share from just this =
single<BR>
contract would value the stock above $6 by calculating the .36 cents<BR>
per share total at an average industry PE of 18 - 22.<BR>
<BR>
Examining LETH - By The Numbers:<BR>
<BR>
Total Assets: 36.8 Million =3D 1.26 per share of assets<BR>
Cash: 23.4 Million =3D .80 cents per share of cash<BR>
Shares Outstanding: 29 million (down from 31.8 million) after 2.8<BR>
million shares retired in Feb. '04<BR>
Additional Shares to be Retired: 1.3 million per Company press =
release<BR>
Estimated Shares in Float: 7 million<BR>
Completed Biosphere Process Systems Now in Operation: 26<BR>
<BR>
Record Backlog of Sales for LETH:<BR>
<BR>
During the past year, over 20 additional Biosphere Process Systems =
have<BR>
been ordered, which upon completion represents a backlog exceeding =
over<BR>
$100 Million in upcoming sales. Many of these contractual agreements<BR>
include options for the purchase of additional Biosphere Systems in =
the<BR>
future once the initial order has been completed. The options vary =
from<BR>
hundreds to thousands of units which would send shockwaves through =
this<BR>
low-float, emerging industry leader at an average sale price of $7<BR>
Million per Biosphere Process System!<BR>
<BR>
LETH's Blue Chip Partner - Fortifying the System:<BR>
<BR>
LETH is an alliance partner with Tetra Tech, Inc. (NASDAQ: TTEK, $20) =
a<BR>
leader and one of the largest providers in environmental, =
mechanical,<BR>
and electrical management consulting services primarily for the US<BR>
Government with annual sales of $800 Million. Tetra Tech will coordinate =
the<BR>
securing of necessary permits, installation, and continuous =
worldwide<BR>
monitoring of the Biosphere Process System for LETH. Tetra Tech is =
now<BR>
in the process of obtaining Department of Environmental Quality<BR>
permitting for the Biosphere Process in the state of Louisiana. This is =
a<BR>
monumental event for LETH which opens the floodgates for major =
project<BR>
revenues in Louisiana while having a parallel effect on LETH stock in =
the<BR>
form of a huge near-term announcement.<BR>
<BR>
Stock Set to Explode on Earnings Boom:<BR>
<BR>
LETH has the impressive financials and sales already in the pipeline =
to<BR>
achieve record-setting stock price levels in support of the =
Company's<BR>
breakout year. The added kicker is that LETH has historically =
released<BR>
&quot;batches&quot; of very significant news announcements regarding =
successfully<BR>
completed sales contracts early in the calendar year. We feel that<BR>
pattern is repeating itself as evidenced by what has just been =
released<BR>
with some very big surprises still to come. There aren't any companies =
at<BR>
any price level with the technology or exponential sales growth to<BR>
match LETH, while simultaneously containing all the ingredients for =
major<BR>
profits as global demand to solve two crises areas, waste and =
electrical<BR>
energy, reaches unprecedented levels.<BR>
