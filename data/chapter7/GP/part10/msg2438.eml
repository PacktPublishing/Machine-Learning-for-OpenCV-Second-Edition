A man who wanted to rest on the ground used a jar as a pillow. It was =
so<BR>
hard that he asked his servant to staff it with feathers to make it =
soft. A<BR>
pupil was talking about the recent fire in his school. &quot;I knew it =
was going<BR>
to happen.&quot; he said, &quot;Because we've been practicing for it =
all<BR>
year&quot;.Computer manufacturers are considering changing the =
instructional<BR>
words &quot;Press Any Key&quot; to &quot;Press Return Key&quot;, because =
too many people have<BR>
been calling to ask where the &quot;Any&quot; key is.<BR>
When my printer's type began to go faint, I called a repair shop where =
a<BR>
friendly man told me that the printer probably needed only to be =
cleaned.<BR>
Because the shop charged 50 pounds for such cleanings, he told me, it =
would<BR>
be better for me to read the printer's directions and try the job =
myself.<BR>
Pleasantly surprised by his words, I asked, &quot;Does your boss know =
that you<BR>
discourage business?&quot;&quot;Actually it's my boss's idea,&quot; the =
employee replied.<BR>
&quot;We usually make more money on repairs if we let people try to =
repair things<BR>
themselves first.&quot;<BR>
