<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Mr.Chan Fung.<BR>
Manager of Land Bank,<BR>
Kincheng Branch.<BR>
6,Min Shen Rd,Kicheng Chen,<BR>
Kinmen Hsien, Fukien.Taiwan<BR>
R.O.C.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
I am Mr.Chan Fung, Bank Manager of Land Bank,Kincheng branch, =
Fukien,Taiwan. R.O.C.I have urgent and very confidential business =
proposition for you.<BR>
<BR>
On June 6, 1999, a British Oil consultant/contractor with the Chinese =
Solid Minerals Corporation, Mr. Smith Lawrence made a numbered time =
(Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at&nbsp; =
US$30,000,000.00 (Thirty Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I =
sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. =
After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we&nbsp; discovered from =
his contract employers, the Chinese Solid Minerals Corporation that Mr. =
Smith Lawrence died from an automobile accident. On further =
investigation, I found out that he died&nbsp; without making a WILL, and =
all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.<BR>
<BR>
I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Smith =
Lawrence did not declare any kin or relations in all his official =
documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of =
US$30,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being =
rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will =
ever come forward to claim it. According to&nbsp; Laws of Republic of =
China, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the =
ownership of the Chinese Government if nobody applies to claim the =
fund.<BR>
<BR>
Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to =
stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Smith Lawrence so that the fruits of =
this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt&nbsp; =
government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide =
immediately your full names and address so that the attorney will =
prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you =
in&nbsp; place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an =
attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the =
necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your&nbsp; =
favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you =
will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as =
the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into&nbsp; your =
account for us to share in the ratio of 90% for me and 10% for you.<BR>
<BR>
There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will =
be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees =
the successful execution of this transaction. If you&nbsp; are =
interested, please reply immediately via this email address immediately. =
Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and =
relevant documents that will&nbsp; help you understand the transaction. =
Please send me your confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy =
communication.<BR>
<BR>
Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this =
transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall =
require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Awaiting =
your urgent reply.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks and regards,<BR>
<BR>
Mr.Chan Fung.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </FONT>
