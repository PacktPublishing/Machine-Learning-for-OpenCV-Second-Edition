<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Dear Friend.<BR>
<BR>
I am Hajia Mariam Abacha the wife of the formal head of state the<BR>
Federal Republic of Nigerian Late General Sani Abacha.<BR>
<BR>
Following the sudden death of my husband General Sani Abacha the =
late<BR>
former head of state of Nigeria in June 1998, I have been thrown into =
a<BR>
state of utter confusion, frustration and hopelessness by the =
present<BR>
civilian administration, I have been subjected to physical and<BR>
psychological torture by the security agents in the country.<BR>
<BR>
I have lost confidence with anybody within the country. You must =
have<BR>
heard over the media reports and the internet on the recovery of<BR>
various huge sums of money deposited by my husband in different<BR>
security firms abroad, some companies willingly give up their =
secrets<BR>
and disclosed our money confidently lodged there or many out right<BR>
blackmail.<BR>
<BR>
In fact the total sum discovered by the Government so far is in the<BR>
tune of $700. Million dollars. And they are not relenting to make me =
poor for life.<BR>
<BR>
I got your contacts through my personal research, and out of =
desperation<BR>
decided to reach you. I will give you more information as to this =
regard<BR>
as soon as you reply. I repose great confidence in you hence my<BR>
approach to you due to security network placed on my day affairs I =
cannot afford to visit the embassy so that is why I decided to contact =
you and I hope you will not betray my confidence in you. I have =
deposited the sum of 35.3 million dollars) with a security firm abroad =
whose name is with held for now until we open communication.<BR>
<BR>
I shall be grateful if you could receive this fund into your account<BR>
for safe keeping. This arrangement is known to you my lawyer and my =
son<BR>
Mohammed Abacha alone who have just been released by the Federal =
Government, so my lawyer will deal directly with you as security is up =
my whole being.<BR>
<BR>
I am seriously considering to settle down abroad in a friendly<BR>
atmosphere like yours as soon as this fund get into your account so that =
I can start all over again if only you wish, but if it is impossible, =
just help me in diverting this fund into your account which will accrue =
you 30% of this fund . Please honesty is the watch word in this =
transaction.<BR>
<BR>
I will urgently require for your very private number or cell if any.<BR>
<BR>
In case you don't accept please do not let me out to the security as =
I<BR>
am giving you this information in total trust and confidence<BR>
<BR>
I will greatly appreciate if you accept my proposal in good<BR>
faith. Please expedite action. And do get back to me immediately.<BR>
<BR>
Sincerely yours<BR>
<BR>
Hajia Mariam Abacha<BR>
