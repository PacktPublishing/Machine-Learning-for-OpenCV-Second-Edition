When I take a long time, I am slow. When my boss takes a long time, he =
is
thorough. When I don't do it, I am lazy. When my boss doesn't do it, he =
is
too busy. When I do something without being told, I am trying to be =
smart.
When my boss does the same, that is initiative. When I please my boss, I =
am
ass-kissing. When my boss pleases his boss, he is co-operating. I do =
good,
my boss never remembers. When I do wrong, he never forgets<br>
A professor was giving a big test one day to his students. He handed out
all of the tests and went back to his desk to wait. Once the test was =
over
the students all handed the tests back in. The professor noticed that =
one of
the students had attached a $100 bill to his test with a note saying "A
dollar per  point." The next class the professor handed the tests back =
out.
This student got back his test and $64 change.<br>
A local bar was so sure that its bartender was the strongest man around
that they offered a standing $1,000 bet. The bartender would squeeze a =
lemon
until all the juice ran into a glass, and hand the lemon to a patron. =
Anyone
who could squeeze one more drop of juice out would win the money. Many
people had tried over time (weightlifters, longshoremen, etc.) but =
nobody
could do it. One day a scrawny little man wearing thick glasses and a
polyester suit came in and said in a tiny, squeaky voice, "I'd like to =
try
the bet." After the laughter had died down, the bartender said okay, =
grabbed
a lemon, and squeezed away. Then he handed the wrinkled remains of the =
rind
to the little man. But the crowd's laughter turned to total silence as =
the
man clenched his fist around the lemon and six drops fell into the =
glass. As
the crowd cheered, the bartender paid the $1,000, and asked the little =
man,
"What do you do for a living? Are you a lumberjack, a weightlifter, or
what?" The man replied, "I work for the IRS."<br>
