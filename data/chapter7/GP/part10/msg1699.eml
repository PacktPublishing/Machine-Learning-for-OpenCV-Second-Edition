<P><FONT SIZE=2>Attn: George.<BR>
<BR>
I am Odega Felix (Esq.), a Solicitor. I am the Personal<BR>
Attorney to Mr. Fredrick George, a national of your country,<BR>
who is an oil merchant in Nigeria. On the 21st of April<BR>
2001, my client, his wife and their two children were<BR>
involved in a car accident along Sagbama Express Road, here<BR>
in Nigeria. All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost<BR>
their lives. Since then I have made several inquiries to<BR>
locate any of my clients extended relatives, this has<BR>
proven unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful<BR>
attempts, I decided to trace his relatives over the<BR>
Internet, but of no avail, hence I mandated my secretary to<BR>
search for any possible relative of my late clients in the<BR>
Internet before the bank get the account confiscated or<BR>
declared unserviceable, the bank where the deceased had an<BR>
account valued at about US$14.8m (Fourteen million eight<BR>
hundred thousand United States Dollars). The bank has<BR>
issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or have the<BR>
account confiscated within the next 14 working days. I then<BR>
decided to present you as the next of kin of the deceased<BR>
since you are from the same country and bear the same name.<BR>
The said amount will be paid to you if you comply<BR>
immediately with all the necessary documents of the<BR>
deceased in my possession. Immediately the money is paid to<BR>
you, 55% of the total amount will be for me, 40% for you,<BR>
while the remaining 5% should be for expenses or tax as<BR>
your government may require.<BR>
I have all the necessary legal documents that can be used<BR>
to back up our claim. All I require is your honest<BR>
cooperation to enable us see this transaction through. I<BR>
guarantee you that this will be executed under a legitimate<BR>
arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the<BR>
law. In other words, I am giving you my words that the<BR>
documents to back up our claims will show that the<BR>
deposited funds, when it is finally paid to you, will in no<BR>
way violate the existing laws of your country nor that of<BR>
mine.<BR>
I expect your urgent reply to enable us discuss further.<BR>
Please if you are willing to assist in this transaction,<BR>
reply through my personal email address:<BR>

Best regards,<BR>
<BR>
