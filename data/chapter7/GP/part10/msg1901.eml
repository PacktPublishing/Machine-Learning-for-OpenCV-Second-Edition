<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Dear friend,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
This mail may be a surprise to you because you did not give me the =
permission to do so and neither do you know me but before I tell you =
about myself I want you to please forgive me for sending the mail =
without your permission.&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
My name is Sarah Adidi Guei, 28 years old and the daughter of the late =
military ruler of Ivory-Coast ( Retired Brigadier General Robert Guei) =
who was killed in a political crisis which led to war in my =
country(Ivory-Coast)some weeks ago.My father,mother and two junior =
brothers were killed by some soldiers believed to be loyal to the =
government because of my father's objection to some certain policies of =
the present government. I was lucky to have escaped with a brother who =
is the last child of the family that night because we were visiting a =
family friend in another city far away from our home.<BR>
<BR>
I have to go into hiding with my junior brother for some days before =
arrangements were made for us to leave Ivory-Coast for the Republic of =
Togo on the invitation of President Eyadema of Togo who granted us =
political assylum.<BR>
<BR>
Before we left for Togo,I visited our home where my mother and my two =
junior ones were killed in our village and during the search for some =
documents in my father's room came accross some vital documents and the =
keys to a secret vault in the house.I took the keys and went down to =
where the vault is and there I discovered two metal boxes which were =
carefully hidden. With the aide of the documents I was able to open the =
boxes only to find out that the boxes were full of money in hundred =
dollar bills. I could not count the money because I was very shock to =
see it and again it is too much for me to count but the documents that I =
discovered in his room which led me to the boxes put the money at =
$10,000,000:00(ten million dollars).<BR>
<BR>
I locked it back carefully and arranged for the boxes to be moved with =
me through the help of some family friends to Abidjan the capital city =
where I deposited the boxes with a security company for safe-keeping.I =
did not declare the content of the boxes to the security company,I only =
declare it as family valuables.<BR>
<BR>
When the African leaders came to Ivory-Coast and President Eyadema =
invited us to go to the Republic of Togo where I now live with my junior =
one.I cannot leave the money there in Abidjan so I am making =
arrangements to move the boxes to Togo where I now live and have the =
money transfered by bank abroad.<BR>
<BR>
This has been my reason for contacting you.<BR>
<BR>
I would have given you my telephone number so that you can call me in =
order to discuss the issue better but I'm afraid to do so because we =
have too many people around us who I would not want to know of the money =
but I have a laptop with me all the time and I think it will be better =
to communicate by Internet untill we can make proper and solid =
arrangements about how to move the money.<BR>
<BR>
I wish to meet with you if you can make a trip to The Republic of Togo =
or Ivory-Coast,then we can meet secretly before we go ahead for the =
transaction.Never mind about your expenditure it will be taken care of =
though I may not be able to send some money to you right now but I will =
pay it back if you can do it and not only that,I am ready to offer 30% =
of the money to you for this assistance.It is not that I am paying you =
but for your assistance which I shall really appreciate.&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
Please I wish that this assistance be treated highly confidential.<BR>
<BR>
