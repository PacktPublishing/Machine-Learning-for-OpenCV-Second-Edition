              <p>According to John P. Gorst, Chairman of InsynQ, "We are =
very pleased to announce the continued growth in our revenues.  The last =
two years have been devoted to raising the awareness levels of the =
financial and accounting communities to the ASP computing model.  We =
have accomplished this largely through the development of our =
e-Accounting division with its hosted software solutions.  We are seeing =
the results of these efforts as our revenues have increased 21% over the =
same period a year ago, and our user base has increased a dramatic 46%.  =
We believe we are on the path to success.</p>
              <p>?According to Dun and Bradstreet, this vertical =
generates over $76 billion in annual revenue of which we are looking to =
capture 5% of the total provider market over the next 3 years.  As the =
adoption rate accelerates with over 122,000 CPA?s, bookkeepers and other =
financial related services providers here in the US market, we believe =
we can achieve our projections for revenue growth.  We are on the =
?seminar trail? delivering the ?anytime, anywhere? message to these =
services providers.  In addition, we fit very well into back office =
outsourcing services, and it is our combined message that has been =
reaching this market segment.?</p>

              <p><strong>ASP Industry </strong><br>
                <strong>What Is An Application Service Provider (ASP) =
</strong><br>
An application service provider (ASP) is a company that offers =
individuals or groups access over the Internet to software applications =
and related services that would otherwise have to be located in their =
own personal or enterprise computers. ASP services are expected to =
become an important alternative, not only for smaller companies with low =
budgets for information technology, but also for larger companies as a =
form of outsourcing and for many services for individuals as well. </p>

              <p>Early applications include: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Remote access serving for the users of an enterprise =
</li>
                <li>An off-premises local area network to which mobile =
users can be connected, with a common file server </li>
                <li>Specialized applications that would be expensive to =
install and maintain within your own company or on your own computer =
</li>
              </ul>
              <p>While ASPs are forecast to provide applications and =
services to small enterprises and individuals on a pay-per-use or yearly =
license basis, larger corporations are essentially providing their own =
ASP service in-house, moving applications off personal computers and =
putting them on a special kind of application server that is designed to =
handle the stripped-down kind of thin client workstation. This allows an =
enterprise to reassert the central control over application cost and =
usage that corporations formerly had in the period prior to the advent =
of the PC. Microsoft's Terminal Server product and Citrix's WinFrame =
products are leading thin-client application server products. </p>
              <p><strong>MSP Industry </strong></p>
              <p><strong>What is an MSP? </strong><br>
  The managed service provider (MSP) phenomenon is between 18 and 24 =
months old and is attracting a lot of attention from potential users and =
service providers wanting to add value. But different providers define =
it different ways, and service offerings range from the very limited to =
the very broad. <br>
  <br>
  A managed service provider delivers aspects of outsourced IT =
operations, usually via an IP network. All MSPs remotely manage network =
infrastructure on an ongoing basis, while some extend their offerings to =
provide and manage application infrastructure. Note: Some MSPs refer to =
themselves as 'management service providers. </p>
              <p><strong>Three main types of MSP </strong><br>
  In today's market, three main types of MSP can be distinguished. They =
differ in terms of: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>The range of services offered </li>
                <li>The amount of responsibility they take for a =
client's business </li>
                <li>Scope - that is, the size of the MSP and the size of =
their target customer </li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>The low level - pure-play MSPs </strong><br>
  This group of MSPs describe themselves as 'management service =
providers', not 'managed service providers'. Many of the members of the =
year-old MSP Association fall into this category. The defining principle =
here is that these MSPs assist client companies in managing network =
infrastructure and limit themselves primarily to monitoring the =
performance of the network and of applications running over the network. =
They deliver services remotely via an IP network, sometimes by gathering =
data from a client's site via a networked server placed on site. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Range of services </strong><br>
  Watching uptime, performance and availability are the central value =
propositions of this type of MSP, although many in this category are =
expanding into extended infrastructure services, such as security, =
storage and testing. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Level of responsibility </strong><br>
  This type of MSP takes little, if any, responsibility for a client's =
business. If it offers a service-level agreement, it is likely to be for =
the uptime of its own monitoring process, not for the client's website. =
Its activities might be limited to reporting and alerts if a website =
experiences problems, or might extend to generating and tracking problem =
reports. If it extends its offerings to include security and storage, =
its responsibility level may increase accordingly. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Scope </strong><br>
  MSPs at this level tend to be small (50-300 employees). Their clients =
will be SMEs with IT departments that are either understaffed, taken up =
with major projects, or focused on non-infrastructure core competencies. =
Clients tend to engage a low-level MSP for one aspect of infrastructure =
monitoring; if the relationship develops satisfactorily, they will then =
add additional services over time. <br>
  <br>
  This level of MSP is attempting to make MSP work as a business model, =
which will have short-term success at best. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>The mid-level - MSP as a value-added service </strong><br>
  Mid-level MSPs tend to describe themselves as 'managed service =
providers' and to offer a broader range of services that take greater =
responsibility for a client's business. </p>
              <p><strong>Range of services </strong><br>
  These MSPs may move beyond performance monitoring and reporting to =
software patches, installation and upgrades, and application =
infrastructure provision, which require them to be proficient in web =
application servers. An MSP at this level will take pride in offering as =
wide a range of services as possible, seeing this as a differentiator. =
<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Level of responsibility </strong><br>
  Mid-level MSPs also differentiate themselves by assuming greater =
responsibility for the functioning of a client's business. If a site =
goes down, they will do more than notification - they will work with the =
client to restore function. Service-level agreements reflect this level =
of responsibility. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Scope </strong><br>
  MSPs at this level can be large, as managed service will be folded in =
to other service offerings, such as web hosting or network provision. =
They target the Fortune 500 or 1,000 enterprise as a customer, although =
many also serve medium-sized clicks-and-mortar companies. <br>
  <br>
  Web-hosting providers such as Digex offer MSP at this level as a =
value-added service to their core service provision, which is hosting =
websites. Major Telcos such as Cable &amp; Wireless and France Telecom =
(via Equant and Global One) offer MSP as well. Loudcloud is probably the =
best-known example of a pure-play MSP that has grown its business =
successfully in past years, although it is currently struggling to make =
the concept work in an inhospitable economy. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>The high level - outsourcing IT operations </strong><br>
  These MSPs undertake to allow clients to outsource their entire IT =
operation, if desired - truly one-stop shopping. They can also provide =
lower levels of service, like a mid-level MSP. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Range of services </strong><br>
  MSPs at this level offer a full range of traditional managed service =
and add aspects of application handling, such as integration and even =
application hosting, which can be defined as 'one-to-one remote custom =
outsourcing of applications. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Level of responsibility </strong><br>
  Service-level agreements in this segment will be customized to reflect =
differing levels of responsibility available to clients, depending on =
how much they want and are willing to pay. This type of MSP can be the =
mythical xSP that shapes the technological identity of the client, =
choosing its hardware, storage, level of security and packaged =
application suites. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Scope </strong><br>
  Small and large providers co-exist in this space, serving different =
constituencies. Systems integrators and consultancies play here. =
Boutique shops serve SMEs, and large providers such as EDS, IBM Global =
Services and Pricewaterhouse Coopers serve large multinational =
