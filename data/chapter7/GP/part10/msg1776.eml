Landon had made an unsuccessful attempt at the recitation, and the =
doctor,<BR>
somewhat nettled, said:&quot;Landon, you don't seem to be getting on =
very fast in<BR>
this subject. You seem to lack ambition. Why, at your age Alexander =
the<BR>
Great had conquered half the world.&quot;&quot;Yes,&quot; said =
Landon,&quot;he couldn't help it,<BR>
for you will recall the fact, doctor, that Alexander the Great had =
Aristotle<BR>
for a teacher.<BR>
On the first day of college, the Dean addressed the students, pointing =
out<BR>
some of the rules: &quot;The female dormitory will be out-of-bounds for =
all male<BR>
students, and the male dormitory to the female students. Anybody =
caught<BR>
breaking this rule will be fined $20 the first time.&quot; He continued: =
&quot;Anybody<BR>
caught breaking this rule the second time will be fined $60. Being =
caught a<BR>
third time will incur a hefty fine of $180. Are there any =
questions?&quot;!!!!At<BR>
this point, a male student in the crowd inquired: &quot;How much for a =
season<BR>
pass?&quot;<BR>
