<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>OTC FIRST ALERT -&nbsp; NEW Public Company of the =
Month<BR>
<BR>
Symbol: FMNJ<BR>
Market: OTC<BR>
Sector: FMNJ is a gold exploration and mining company<BR>
<BR>
The BULL Market in Metals is Just BEGINNING!! &quot;Which is the better =
buy now, technology or mining stocks? Surprise, the winner is mining =
stocks. Mining stocks have more momentum.&nbsp; Mining companies are in =
the early stages of a growth cycle as demand for nickel, copper and gold =
increases.&quot; - Jim Jubak, a senior markets editor for MSN Money<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Franklin Mining, Inc. (OTC: FMNJ) is a gold exploration and mining =
company.&nbsp; FMNJ has a long 138-year history beginning in the late =
1860s with the gold strikes in central Colorado - (formerly as Franklin =
Mining Co. and Franklin Consolidated Mining Co.)<BR>
<BR>
Due to the recent stable and rocketing Gold prices, FMNJ is again =
gearing up, acquiring and developing two initial mining properties: the =
Franklin Mines and Mills in Colorado and the El Alacran Deposit in =
Colombia. These mining projects have major Gold ore body potential, =
which is indicated by exploration results and drilling results.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The Franklin Mines and Mills in Colorado have multiple claims, existing =
permits, and a crushing and flotation mill on site.&nbsp; It has a =
history of producing gold, silver, lead, zinc and copper, and the =
potential to become a small - to medium producer of high-grade gold, =
silver and base metals.&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
Geologist Gifford A Dieterle has summarized the mineral valuations of =
the Franklin Mines as follows:<BR>
&nbsp;* Proven/probable Gold mining potential is 58,680 oz, which at =
$390/oz it equates to over $22.8 million; the Silver potential is =
1,255,572 oz, which at $6 oz it equates to over $7.5 million<BR>
<BR>
These valuations only take into account the current Gold and Silver =
values that can actually be sampled, additional gold and silver may be =
discovered as mining resumes.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&quot;...Gold ascends to $500 an ounce...&quot; this is a =
prediction made for gold in the year of 2004 - Byron Wien, a US Senior =
Investment Strategist with Morgan Stanley.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The El Alacran Deposit project includes three exploration licenses =
totaling 1,265 hectares of known gold, copper and silver resources. =
Geologist Robert P. Shaw has summarized calculations of gold and copper =
resources as follows:<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;* Proven Gold underground mining potential is 96,280 oz, which at =
$390/oz it equates to over $37 million; the proven Copper potential is =
84,532,577 lbs, which at $1.00/lb it equates to over $84 million.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;* Possible Gold open pit mining potential is 41,324oz, which at =
$390/oz it equates to over $16 million.<BR>
&nbsp;* Possible/probable Gold underground mining potential is 206,610 =
oz, which at $390/oz it equates to over $80 million; the Copper =
potential is 216,341,000 lbs, which at $1.00/lb it equates to over $216 =
million<BR>
<BR>
The El Alacran ore zones are not constricted, appear to repeat =
systematically and are open at depth, which offers possibilities for the =
exploration, discovery and long-term development of potentially =
large-scale Gold and Copper resources.&nbsp; Silver is also indicated =
and probably significant but calculations are premature at this =
time.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
FINAL CONSIDERATIONS<BR>
<BR>
We are still a long way from gold being overvalued and, in the meantime, =
there is an awful lot of money to be made in this sector, especially in =
mineral exploration companies.&quot; - Paul Van Eeden<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The mining potential that FMNJ could extract from these two mines is =
over $465 million. However that is not enough for FMNJ.<BR>
<BR>
FMNJ is continuing to drive ahead and is currently investigating other =
mineral properties and active precious metal mines in North and South =
America to:<BR>
1. Successfully grow its asset base<BR>
2. Revitalize its operations<BR>
3. Producing low cost precious and base metals<BR>
4. To generate a substantial return to its investors!<BR>
