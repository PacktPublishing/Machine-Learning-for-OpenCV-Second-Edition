<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Market Mover Stock Report's Last Pick (CWTD) exploded =
from $1.19 to<BR>
$9.20, a gain of over 670% in 5 days (Feb 12 - 17)!!!<BR>
<BR>
Here is our NEXT HOT PICK which we feel is the most undervalued =
stock<BR>
we have ever featured and should outperform all other picks this year =
based<BR>
on their sales figures (incl. a backlog of over $100 Million), =
incredibly solid<BR>
numbers, and low outstanding share total.<BR>
<BR>
Life Energy and Technology Holdings, Inc.<BR>
(OTCBB: LETH)<BR>
Current Price: 2.45<BR>
Near-Term Target: 7.00<BR>
Projected High for '04: 15.00<BR>
<BR>
We are sending this URGENT INVESTOR BULLETIN REVEALING THE<BR>
MOST UNDERVALUED STOCK ON THE OTCBB to our millions of<BR>
subscribers for substantial profits immediately!<BR>
Sales orders received by LETH exceed $150 Million over the past year<BR>
while major news was just released that adds multi-millions to the =
bottom<BR>
line. LETH has experienced a recent spike in price and volume =
indicating<BR>
heavy accumulation of shares which is a sign of even bigger things to =
come<BR>
for this emerging world leader in the conversion of waste materials =
into<BR>
electrical energy, an industry with such high global demand that it =
is<BR>
impossible to assign a value to the size of the market.<BR>
<BR>
(Mar 9 '04) Urgent News Update:<BR>
LETH Announces the Sale of Two (2) Biosphere Process Systems to<BR>
Procura International Limited for $14 Million with an Option for the =
Sale of<BR>
an Additional 98 Systems Over the Next 24 Months.<BR>
<BR>
Solving a Dual Crisis - Waste and Energy:<BR>
<BR>
LETH is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their =
Biosphere<BR>
Process System to generate revenue from the disposal of a wide variety =
of<BR>
waste products at 5 to 7 tons per hour which makes a major impact on =
the<BR>
global waste problem. This profitable and environmentally safe =
process<BR>
converts into clean, &quot;green&quot; electricity such waste materials =
as Municipal<BR>
Solid Waste, agricultural wastes, forestry wastes, medical wastes, =
industrial<BR>
wastes, sewage sludge, shale oil, sour natural gas, and the huge market =
of<BR>
used tires. LETH profits from the sale of electricity created from the =
waste<BR>
conversion on a continuous basis by generating 5 to 10 mega-watts per =
hour<BR>
of electricity which is then sold to replenish the local or national =
grid.<BR>
<BR>
(Mar 3 '04) LETH Release Major Product Delivery and Net Profit News<BR>
LETH delivered 12 Biosphere Process Systems which resulted in a net =
profit<BR>
of $3.5 Million, the equivalent of .12 cents per share. LETH is =
scheduled to<BR>
receive an additional $7 Million translating into an additional .24 =
cents per<BR>
share which is the balance of this completed contract over the next 6 =
months.<BR>
The net profit per share from just this single contract would value the =
stock<BR>
above $6 by calculating the .36 cents per share total at an average =
industry<BR>
PE of 18 - 22.<BR>
<BR>
Examining LETH - By The Numbers<BR>
<BR>
Total Assets: 36.8 Million =3D 1.26 per share of assets<BR>
Cash: 23.4 Million =3D .80 cents per share of cash<BR>
Shares Outstanding: 29 million (down from 31.8 million) after 2.8 =
million<BR>
shares retired in Feb. '04<BR>
Additional Shares to be Retired: 1.3 million per Company press =
release<BR>
Estimated Shares in Float: 7 million<BR>
Completed Biosphere Process Systems Now in Operation: 26<BR>
<BR>
Record Backlog of Sales for LETH:<BR>
<BR>
During the past year, over 20 additional Biosphere Process Systems =
have<BR>
been ordered, which upon completion represents a backlog exceeding =
over<BR>
$100 Million in upcoming sales. Many of these contractual agreements<BR>
include options for the purchase of additional Biosphere Systems in =
the<BR>
future once the initial order has been completed. The options vary =
from<BR>
hundreds to thousands of units which would send shockwaves through =
this<BR>
low-float, emerging industry leader at an average sale price of $7 =
Million<BR>
per Biosphere Process System!<BR>
<BR>
LETH's Blue Chip Partner - Fortifying the System:<BR>
<BR>
LETH is an alliance partner with Tetra Tech, Inc. (NASDAQ: TTEK, $20) =
a<BR>
leader and one of the largest providers in environmental, mechanical, =
and<BR>
electrical management consulting services primarily for the US =
Government<BR>
with annual sales of $800 Million. Tetra Tech will coordinate the =
securing of<BR>
necessary permits, installation, and continuous worldwide monitoring of =
the<BR>
Biosphere Process System for LETH. Tetra Tech is now in the process =
of<BR>
obtaining Department of Environmental Quality permitting for the<BR>
Biosphere Process in the state of Louisiana. This is a monumental event =
for<BR>
LETH which opens the floodgates for major project revenues in =
Louisiana<BR>
while having a parallel effect on LETH stock in the form of a huge =
near-<BR>
term announcement.<BR>
<BR>
Stock Set to Explode on Earnings Boom:<BR>
<BR>
LETH has the impressive financials and sales already in the pipeline =
to<BR>
achieve record-setting stock price levels in support of the =
Company's<BR>
breakout year. The added kicker is that LETH has historically =
released<BR>
&quot;batches&quot; of very significant news announcements regarding =
successfully<BR>
completed sales contracts early in the calendar year. We feel that =
pattern is<BR>
repeating itself as evidenced by what has just been released with some =
very<BR>
big surprises still to come. There aren't any companies at any price =
level<BR>
with the technology or exponential sales growth to match LETH, while<BR>
simultaneously containing all the ingredients for major profits as =
global<BR>
demand to solve two crisis areas, waste and electrical energy, =
reaches<BR>
unprecedented levels.<BR>
