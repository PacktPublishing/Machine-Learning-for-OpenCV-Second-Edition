<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>a.d.vFWD. Conrad Hilton, founder of the famous Hilton =
hotel<BR>
<BR>
Known to the tabloids as &quot;Paris the Heiress,&quot;<BR>
Hilton made a name for herself as a party-hopping<BR>
socialite early in the 21st century.<BR>
She is the great-granddaughter of hotel magnate<BR>
Conrad Hilton, founder of the famous Hilton hotel<BR>
chain. Paris and her younger sister Nicky are worth<BR>
about $500 million each!&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
Well, it seems about 3 years ago when Paris was a<BR>
mere 19 year old, she allowed her then-boyfriend<BR>
to tape a little XXX home footage, ala &quot;Pam &amp; Tommy&quot;<BR>
style! And of course, that same boyfriend is seeking<BR>
to make a little profit for himself now that times are tough.<BR>
<BR>
He has sold the footage to an &quot;unknown web site&quot; intent<BR>
on showing the entire footage on their adult web site<BR>
