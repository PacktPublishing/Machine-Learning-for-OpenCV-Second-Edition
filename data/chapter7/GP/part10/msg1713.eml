MARKET-TORQUE - The European Union&#146;s Premier U.S. NASDAQ =
Timer...Dateline 3-02-04<BR>
<BR>
New trading range (as of 3/02/04): Target-- 1.74 - True Health. Inc. =
(OTCBB: TRHL)<BR>
<BR>
Monday, after the close, the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence =
(MACD) Oscillator rose above its signal line indicating a trend =
reversal. Never before in this stock&#146;s history have the lines =
crossed this early.&nbsp; This means a huge reversal and strong =
up-trend. The stock is now headed upward.&nbsp; This time it indicates =
1.74. This is exactly what happened in late November, three months ago =
when the stock ran from 0.69 to 1.48 in less than a month.<BR>
<BR>
The stock is in position for a higher high and a higher low. The volume =
is very high.&nbsp; Also, TRHL just started again an unusual trading =
pattern.&nbsp; Large blocks of shares are being bought.&nbsp; Is this =
because the earnings are due shortly? Read on.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
EARNINGS REPORT<BR>
New financials are due out very soon (looking for two weeks) - the stock =
has started to climb back toward its recent high.<BR>
<BR>
TRHL has had seven consecutive quarters of revenue growth.&nbsp; Last =
quarter, revenues were up 385% and 329% for the three and nine month =
periods, respectively. The July 31, 2003 quarter revenues were up =
412%.<BR>
<BR>
But this is what we are looking at.&nbsp; Back in November TRHL started =
moving up approximately two weeks before its quarterly financial =
report.&nbsp; We are now approximately two weeks away from its next =
report, and according to the MACD Oscillator the stock has just started =
back on an up-trend.&nbsp; If you get in now, there&#146;s a chance of =
100 percent profit in less than a month.<BR>
