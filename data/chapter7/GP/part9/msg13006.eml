<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Dear Sir,<BR>
<BR>
I am Mr. John Coleman and my sister is Miss Rose Coleman, we are =
thehildren of late Chief Paul Coleman from Sierra Leone. I am writing =
you in absolute confidence primarily to seek your assistance to transfer =
our cash of twenty one Million Dollars ($21,000.000.00) now in the =
custody of a private Security trust firm in Europe the money is in trunk =
boxes deposited and declared as family valuables by my late father as a =
matter of fact the company does not know the content as money, although =
my father made them to under stand that the boxes belongs to his foreign =
partner.<BR>
<BR>
Source of the money:<BR>
<BR>
My late father Chief Paul Coleman , a native of Mende District in the =
Northerh province of Sierra Leone, was the General Manager of Sierra =
Leone Mining co-operation (S.L.M.C.) Freetown . According to my father, =
this money was the income accrued from Mining Co-operation's over draft =
and minor sales.<BR>
<BR>
Before the peak of the civil war between the rebels forces of Major Paul =
Koroma and the combined forces of ECOMOG peace keeping operation that =
almost destroyed my country, following the forceful removal from power =
of the civilian elected President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah by the rebels. My =
father had already made arrangement for his family thats talking about =
my mother, my little sister and myself to be evacuated to HOLLAND =
NETHERLAND, with the CERTIFICATE OF DEPOSIT he made with a security firm =
in Europe through the aid of U.N evacuation team.<BR>
<BR>
During the war in my country, and following the indiscriminate looting =
of Public and Government properties by the rebel forces, the Sierra =
Leone mining coop. Was one of the target looted and it was destroyed. My =
father including other top Government functionaries were attaked and =
killed by the rebels in November 2000 because of his relationship with =
the civilian Government of Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.<BR>
<BR>
As a result of my father's death , and with the news of my uncle's =
involvement in the air crash in Januaryit dashed our hope of survival. =
The untimely deaths caused my mother's heart failure and other related =
complications of which she later died in the hospital after we must have =
spent a lot of money on her early this year . Now my 18 years old sister =
and myself are alone in this strange country suffering without any care =
or help. Without any relation,we are nowlike refugees and orphans.<BR>
<BR>
Our only hope now is in you and the boxes deposited in the Security Firm =
To this effect, I humbly solicit your assistance in the followings =
ways.<BR>
<BR>

beneficiary<BR>

<BR>

behalf in your country and you, our Adviser/ Manager<BR>

the total amount will be for your effort and another 5 % to cover all =
the expenses that may incur during the business transaction, Last, I =
