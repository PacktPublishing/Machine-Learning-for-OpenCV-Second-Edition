It was a very foggy day in London. The fog was so thick that it was<BR>
impossible to see more than a foot or so. buses, cars and taxis were =
not<BR>
able to run and were standing by the side of the road. People were =
trying to<BR>
find their way about on foot but were losing their way in the fog. Mr. =
Smith<BR>
had a very important meeting at the House of Commons and had to get =
there<BR>
but no one could take him. He tried to walk there but found he was =
quite<BR>
lost. Suddenly he bumped into a stranger. The stranger asked if he =
could<BR>
help him. Mr. Smith said he wanted to get to the Houses of Parliament. =
The<BR>
stranger told him he would take him there. Mr. Smith thanked him and =
they<BR>
started to walk there. The fog was getting thicker every minute but =
the<BR>
stranger had no difficulty in finding the way. He went along one =
street,<BR>
turned down another, crossed a square and at last after about half an =
hour's<BR>
walk they arrived at the Houses of Parliament. Mr. Smith couldn't =
understand<BR>
how the stranger found his way. &quot;It is wonderful,&quot; he said. =
&quot;how do you find<BR>
the way in the fog?&quot;&quot;It is no trouble at all to me,&quot; said =
the stranger: &quot; I<BR>
am blind.&quot;<BR>
A local bar was so sure that its bartender was the strongest man =
around<BR>
that they offered a standing $1,000 bet. The bartender would squeeze a =
lemon<BR>
until all the juice ran into a glass, and hand the lemon to a patron. =
Anyone<BR>
who could squeeze one more drop of juice out would win the money. =
Many<BR>
people had tried over time (weightlifters, longshoremen, etc.) but =
nobody<BR>
could do it. One day a scrawny little man wearing thick glasses and =
a<BR>
polyester suit came in and said in a tiny, squeaky voice, &quot;I'd like =
to try<BR>
the bet.&quot; After the laughter had died down, the bartender said =
okay, grabbed<BR>
a lemon, and squeezed away. Then he handed the wrinkled remains of the =
rind<BR>
to the little man. But the crowd's laughter turned to total silence as =
the<BR>
man clenched his fist around the lemon and six drops fell into the =
glass. As<BR>
the crowd cheered, the bartender paid the $1,000, and asked the little =
man,<BR>
&quot;What do you do for a living? Are you a lumberjack, a weightlifter, =
or<BR>
what?&quot; The man replied, &quot;I work for the IRS.&quot;<BR>
