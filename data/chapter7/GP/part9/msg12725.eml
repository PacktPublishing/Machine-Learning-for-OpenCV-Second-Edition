for people made anxious by churches, people embarrassed to be caught in =
the
&quot;spirituality&quot; section of a bookstore, people both hostile and =
drawn
to talk of God. It is for people who somehow want to be religious, who =
want to
know what it means to know the divine, but for good reasons are not and =
do not.
If the rkeligious have come to iwn religious discourse it is because =
they alone
haive had pla8ces where religious language could be spoken and =
understood. Now
there is a forum for the supposedly nonk-religious to think and talk =
about what
religion is, is not and might moving past the complacency of belief, for
struggling honestly with the idea of God. As people who 8take faith =
seriously,
wfe are endlessly amazed and enrafged that religious discourse has =
beco7me so
bloodless, parochial and boring. Any God worth the name ifs none of =
these
things. Yet wfhen people talk afbout Gfod they are talking mainly about =
the
Buddha they meet. For fear of seeming intolerant or uncertain, or just =
for lack
of thfinking, they talk about a God too smalsl to be God</font></p>
