functining for some reason so I don't know if you recieved my =
message.&nbsp; Anyways I have a week off from univercity so I'm pretty =
bored right now, so I thought maybe we can still chat or something since =
I liked your profile :0 Here's my little site I setup&nbsp; <A =
HREF=3D"http://ylxods@www.siktaflow.info/tbo/fre/">http://ylxods@www.sikt=
aflow.info/tbo/fre/</A>&nbsp; you can connect to my webcam from there... =
Because they host my site they ask for verification for some reason, I =
don't know how else can I connect webcam on my own :/<BR>
