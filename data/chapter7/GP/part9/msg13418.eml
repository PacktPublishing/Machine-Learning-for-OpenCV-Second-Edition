<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Good Day Friend,<BR>
With warm heart I offer my friendship, and my greetings, and I hope<BR>
this letter meets you in good time. It will be surprising&nbsp; to you =
to<BR>
receive this proposal from me since you do not know me personally.<BR>
However, I am sincerely seeking your confidence in this transaction,<BR>
which I propose with my free mind and as a person of integrity and =
from<BR>
a family with high moral respect . My name is&nbsp; Dickson Mubane, the =
first<BR>
son of Mapele Mubane, of the&nbsp; most popular black farmer&nbsp; from =
Zimbabwe,<BR>
murdered in the land&nbsp; dispute in my country. As led by my instict, =
My<BR>
motherand Idecided&nbsp; to contact you&nbsp; through email, after =
searching&nbsp; for<BR>
contacts via the internet,as it&nbsp; is the only means I can contact =
anybody since I<BR>
am cutting off ties with&nbsp; Zimbabwe for security and safety =
reasons.&nbsp; However, I<BR>
apologize&nbsp; if this is not acceptable to you.<BR>
The purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed assistance =
in&nbsp; a<BR>
business venture. Due to the land and political problems in&nbsp; =
Zimbabwe,<BR>
as a result of President Robert Mugabe's introduction of&nbsp; new Land =
Act<BR>
Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and the&nbsp; few rich =
black<BR>
farmers, and his desire to hold on to power for life,&nbsp; my father =
for saw<BR>
the danger that came in Zimbabwe. Before he was&nbsp; murdered, he =
withdrewall of our business foreign accounts in dollars&nbsp; and sold =
up our sharesin major companies. We then went to&nbsp; SOUTH =
AFRICA&nbsp; to deposit the sum of US$50.million&nbsp; (Fifty million, =
US dollars),in a private&nbsp; security company. This money was =
deposited with this<BR>
Private Security&nbsp; company for safety and security reasons, =
and&nbsp; was to<BR>
be used for the&nbsp; purchase of land, new machines and chemicals<BR>
establishment of new&nbsp; farms in Europe.President Mugabe's support =
for the violent&nbsp; Zimbabwean war veterans&nbsp; andsome lunatics in =
the society, led to the murder of my beloved&nbsp; fatherand other =
innocent lives. I was continually threatened to&nbsp; abandon =
myinheritance from my father after he was murdered. I&nbsp; resited for =
awhile, but when the danger became unbearable, and I&nbsp; survived two =
murderattempts, I fled Zimbabwe.&nbsp; I am currently staying in the =
Netherlands where I am seeking&nbsp; political asylum. In fact my =
decision to come hereto seek asylum, is&nbsp; because the security =
company from South Africa, hasa branch here,&nbsp; and they have moved =
the deposit from their office in Johannesburg down&nbsp; here. I need =
you to assist in receiving thisconsignment from the security&nbsp; =
compamy. Since the law of Netherlands prohibits a refugee (asylum =
seeker) to be involved in such transactions and my mother advised =
that&nbsp; it will be better for our foreign partner to help receive =
this fund to avoid any eye brown being raised by Robert Mugabe, this is =
why&nbsp; I am<BR>
seeking a genuine&nbsp; and reliable&nbsp; partner,who will&nbsp; assist =
in receiving the funds and also investing&nbsp; it wisely in a =
profitable venture.You have to understand that this decision taken by =
me&nbsp; entrusts my future and in your hands, as a result of the safe =
keeping of this money. If you accept to assist me, all I want you to do =
for&nbsp; me, is to assist with arrangements to claim the deposit from =
the&nbsp; security company from their office here in The Netherlands, as =
it has&nbsp; now been transfered from<BR>
Johannesburg,South Africa to their branch in The Netherlands. The =
company will be legally informed&nbsp; of you&nbsp; representing my =
family.<BR>
For your assistance, I have two options for you. Firstly you can<BR>
choose to have 10% of the money for your assistance, and helping my<BR>
family investing this funds, or you can go&nbsp; into partnership with =
me for<BR>
the proper profitable investment of the&nbsp; money in your country.<BR>
Whichever the option you want, please to&nbsp; notify me in your =
reply.&nbsp; I<BR>
have also set aside 1% of this money for all kinds of&nbsp; expenses =
that<BR>
come our way in the process of this transaction, and 4%&nbsp; of the =
total&nbsp; sum for Charitydonation.If you prefer to accept the 10% for =
assisting in representing my family to receive this funds, then =
85%will&nbsp; be left for my family.Please, I want you to maintain the =
absolute secrecy for the purpose&nbsp; of this transaction.&nbsp; I look =
forward to your reply and co-operation, and Ithank you in&nbsp; advance =
as I anticipate your co-operation.You can reach me<BR>
on my&nbsp; private line which is&nbsp; or via email<BR>
Sincerely,<BR>
Dickson Mubane.<BR>
