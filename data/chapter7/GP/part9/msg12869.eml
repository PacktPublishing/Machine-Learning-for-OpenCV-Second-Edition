            <p>BOCA RATON, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 21, 2003--Today, =
World Information Technology Inc. (OTCBB: <a =

target=3D"_blank">WRLT</a> - <a =
href=3D"http://click1.stocksnut.com/sp/t.pl?id=3D11365:53305368" =
target=3D"_blank">News</a>), a leading online, member-created, Internet =
community operating in Taiwan and mainland China, met with potential =
investors and analysts to discuss it's financial objectives and to =
introduced it's fiscal year 2004 earnings guidance. The Company sees =
continuing high growth penetration in main land China . </p>
            <p>World Information also reaffirmed its earnings guidance =
of $0.16 - $0.20 per share for the fiscal year of 2003 ending December =
31, 2003 . The company introduced it's fiscal year 2004 earnings =
guidance in a range of $.45 to $.52 per share. The guidance assumes no =
unusual or nonrecurring items. Unless otherwise noted, earnings per =
share amounts are presented in this news release on a diluted basis and =
are based on weighted-average common and common equivalent shares =
outstanding. </p>
            <p>World Information recently announced that it has received =
a firm commitment for more than $20 Million of private funding to =
support the acquisition of unlisted state owned China companies. The =
Company stated that the financing is expected to be valued by December =
31, 2003 consistent with a firm contract signing with the first =
acquisition. China recently announced that it will open its state owned =
firms wider to foreign investment to be more competitive under it's =
World Trade Organization membership. China 's State Asset Regulatory =
Commission believes that bringing foreign investors into state firms =
through mergers and acquisitions will help improve performance and spur =
the inflow of foreign funds. World Information is rapidly expanding its =
e-commerce offerings to create a broader one-stop for its members and =
our immediate plans include online video gaming, branded lines of =
consumer products, health care products, cosmetics, videos, music and =
entertainment propositions. </p>
            <p>The Company stated that it planned to engage a public =
relations firm to gain broader exposure to the investing community. The =
Company stated that World Information's current market capitalization =
when compared to comparable China based Internet companies was suffering =
from a lack of exposure to the investment community. The Company =
referenced Reuters Investor's calculation of price earnings multiples =
for other similar Chinese Internet companies such as Netease.com, Inc. =
(NTES), Sohu.com, Inc. (SOHU) and Sina Corporation (SINA) as a basis for =
these statements. These companies are currently trading at 70 times =
earnings while World Information currently trades at only 10 times =
earnings. The Company feels that broader exposure to the Company's =
business and it's operating results was lacking and a key initiative for =
2004 was to achieve such exposure to the investing community. </p>
            <p>World Information Technology Inc., operating in Taiwan =
and mainland China , has introduced its first all-around online video =
streaming solution for integrated TV postproduction live custom =
programming. The company has developed proprietary interactive real-time =
two-way data communications. The company has set up various online =
shopping channels at
            http://www.24hh.com.tw and has become a dominant force in =
e-commerce in Taiwan . World Information has established a service =
enabling Internet users to create their own Web sites. The company =
strives to improve the online experience of its users. Users are offered =
an opportunity to participate in commercial activities, which include =
affiliate programs with major merchants. World Information's strategy is =
to be the Republic of China's leading member-created online community =
for people on the Web. </p>
            <p>Included in this release are &quot;forward-looking =
statements&quot; within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act =
of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of =
1934, as amended. Although the company believes that the expectations =
