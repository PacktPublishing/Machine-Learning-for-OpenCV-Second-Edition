Republic of Cote d'Ivoire<BR>
Private email:ochardguei@excite.com<BR>
It is with humility but a broken heart that I write you this mail in =
confidence seeking your urgent assistance.<BR>
My name is Mr Orchard M.Guei, the only surviving son of former President =
of Republic of Cote d'Ivoire(General<BR>
Robert sheriff guei). My ordeal started on the 19th september two years =
ago when all my family members was<BR>
assasinated (father,mother,brothers and sisters) by =
coupists/rebels/authority. I was lucky to be alive today because I<BR>
did not sleep in our quarters on that fateful day as I visited my =
schoolmate outside Abidjan.<BR>
When the news of the holocaust reached me, I had to run to one of the =
remote areas in the western part of Africa<BR>
where I am in hideout and from there I am sending this mail to you.<BR>
I have been discreetly informed by a bank manager who is a good family =
friend that my late father deposited the<BR>
sum of nineteen Million six hundred thousand USD. (19 600 000) in a =
foster account with their bank which he<BR>
intended to use for his political campaings.<BR>
Following the eclipse in my family and clampdown on my fathers =
properties and accounts, the bank manager advised<BR>
me to look for a reliable foreigner who will be honest to act as =
beneficiary and receive the money on my behalf and<BR>
assist me leave the country immediately for investment of the money and =
for me to continue my education as my life<BR>
is at risk here.<BR>
He informed me that there is no risk involved in transfering the money =
to the account of the foreigner I will appoint<BR>
because he has perfected the arrangement and will advise you on what to =
do for quick and successful transfer of the<BR>
money to your account.<BR>
If you are willing to assist me and save my life and career by receiving =
the fund in your account for onward<BR>
investment upon arrival and assist me travel to your country to further =
my education, I have it in mind to offer you<BR>
25% of the total money while 5% will be set aside for any expenses which =
you might incurre in the course of the<BR>
transaction.<BR>
As soon as I received your favourable response, I will give you contact =
of the Bank Manager so that you will contact<BR>
him and arrange the transfer of the money to your base account.<BR>
Kindly reply me as soon as you have received this mail so that I will =
leave this country urgently. If you listen to news<BR>
you will hear the terrible things happening here being announced.<BR>
Yours sincerely,<BR>
Orchard M.Guei<BR>
NB:Please I am looking up to you as my only hope,so do not abandone me =
as I do not have anyone to turn to help and reply to the above email =
address.<BR>
