dealers in my country Liberia and also one of the top traditional rulers =
cabinets and advisor to our former president Charles Taylor of Liberia =
who was now in<BR>

the rebels who were fighting against the regime of President Charles =
Taylor,on their way returning from the meeting concerning the step down =
of the honorable president.<BR>

problem facing my country for over ten year's now,and based with this =
experience,my father deposited the sum of US$6,300 000.00 million us =
Dollars in a trust security and finance company in Dakar Senegal West =
Africa under my name as the next of kin,although he declare it as =
african arts for safe keeping and to avoid query about the source.<BR>
Now I am contacting you with due respect to assist me transfer this =
money out of Africa.I want you to stand as my father's foreign business =
partner so that I can use your name as the co-beneficiary in order to =
handle a successful transfer of this money to your country for =
investment.<BR>
Please protect this mail for the safety of my life and that of my family =
to avoid us being tortured or killed by his left behind secret agents. =
Please I humbly beg you from the bottom of my heart to listen very =
carefully about the situation in my country.<BR>
Please would you do me a favor to receive this fund for me?I will =
equally insist that you make it a very private and confidential matter =
please. If you are capable and know that you will truly and honestly =
help me, write me now,time is no more on my side. Me and my mother have =
decided to give you 15% of the fund on the conclusion of transferring =
the fund out of this country through your assistance.<BR>
