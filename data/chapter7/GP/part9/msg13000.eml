<DIV align=3Dcenter style=3D"font-size:1px; color:#FFFFFF">Had chance at =
last to view The Warner Bros. Legends Collection. All in all, not a bad =
deal, though Yankee Doodle Dandy is not to my taste as entertainment, =
and the cartoons offered on that one are the most superfluous. "Yankee =
Doodle Bugs" whose transfer is atrocious), those cartoons are also on =
Looney Tunes: The Golden Collection. The other two movies, The =
Adventures of Robin Hood and Treasure of the Sierra Madre, are true =
prizes of a golden era. First time that I ever saw either one and was =
impressed by the cinematography and performances. Cartoons on those =
discs look as good as can be expected from laser videodisc masters. =
"Rabbit Hood" has some faded reds, and  Cross Bunny" some distorted =
audio over the titles.  And when the ice cream vendor wagon explodes, =
there is a sudden burst of blocky redartifacts over the lines of the =
black dust cloud. As this cartoon never had a laser videodisc or even a =
VHS release, it is possible the transfer in this case was done from an =
analog television print. The other cartoons in the set are serviceable. =
Picture quality of Katnip is typical of cartoons of the 1930s, and "8 =
Ball Bunny" and "Hot Cross Bunny" fare marginally better than "Rabbit =
Hood" and "RobinHood Daffy", the latter of which has a faint shimmer =
over some of the lines of characters and backgrounds. And all 5 are =
miles ahead of "Yankee Doodle Bugs".</DIV>=20
