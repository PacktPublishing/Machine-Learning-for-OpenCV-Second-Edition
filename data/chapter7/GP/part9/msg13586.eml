Surgeons, nurses and technicians applauded in the operating room after =
Carl and Clarence Aguirre were surgically separated at 10:32 p.m. =
Wednesday, said Steve Osborne, a spokesman for the Children's Hospital =
at Montefiore Medical Center.The operation was completed around 3:15 =
a.m. Thursday, more than 17 hours after it began, Osborne said. Dr. =
David Staffenberg, the boys' plastic surgeon, said the boys were =
&quot;strong and stable.&quot;Several hours after the operation, the =
boys remained sedated and unconscious in the pediatric intensive care =
unit, with &quot;vital signs fine, no apparent problems,&quot; Osborne =
said.Staffenberg delivered the news of the separation to the twins' =
mother, Arlene Aguirre, in a private waiting area. He got on his knees, =
took Aguirre's hands and said &quot;You're now the mother of two =
boys,&quot; said hospital spokeswoman Pamela Adkins.Aguirre burst into =
tears, she said.Doctors teased apart abutting portions of the boys' =
brains after completing an incision around their skull, and the twins' =
head-to-head operating tables were then slightly pulled apart, said =
Osborne.<BR>
