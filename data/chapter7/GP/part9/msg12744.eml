<BR>
LETH is thriving as an emerging world leader in the conversion of =
waste<BR>
materials into electrical energy by utilizing their Biosphere Process =
System,<BR>
making them the hottest undervalued stock at this price level where =
shares<BR>
are ready to explode on huge investor attention.<BR>
<BR>
Sales have rocketed beyond all estimates for LETH with no signs of<BR>
slowing. The numbers continue to stack-up as sales orders for the =
Biosphere<BR>
exceed $150 Million over the past year while the stock price doesn't =
yet<BR>
reflect the appearance of these impressive figures on an upcoming =
balance<BR>
sheet. We are not the first to uncover this phenomenon as the stock is =
under<BR>
accumulation, but we are acting aggressively on this recently filed =
data.<BR>
<BR>
The unique proprietary technology of the Biosphere fills an urgent<BR>
worldwide need for cost-effective renewable energy sources and a<BR>
corresponding universal need to solve critical problems in the disposal =
of<BR>
waste. The Biosphere System provides the highest level of innovative<BR>
technology while securing worldwide acceptance for a revolutionary =
product<BR>
designed to significantly impact the global waste problem while<BR>
simultaneously generating electricity.<BR>
<BR>
The Biosphere System enables LETH to draw revenue from the disposal =
of<BR>
various types of waste at 5 to 7 tons per hour including such materials =
as:<BR>
Municipal Solid Waste, refinery wastes, agricultural surpluses or =
effluents,<BR>
medical waste, industrial waste, shale oil, sour natural gas, and the =
huge<BR>
market of used tires are all converted in the Biosphere Process. LETH =
also<BR>
profits from the sale of electricity created from the waste conversion =
on a<BR>
continuous basis by generating 5 to 10 mega-watts per hour of =
electricity<BR>
which is then sold to replenish the local or national grid.<BR>
<BR>
LETH is an alliance partner with Tetra Tech, Inc. (NASDAQ: TTEK, $20) =
a<BR>
leader and one of the largest providers in environmental, mechanical, =
and<BR>
electrical management consulting services primarily for the US =
Government<BR>
with annual sales of $800 Million. Tetra Tech will coordinate =
permitting,<BR>
installation and continuous worldwide monitoring of the Biosphere =
Process<BR>
System for LETH. Tetra Tech is now in the process of obtaining =
Department<BR>
of Environmental Quality permitting for the Biosphere Process in the =
state of<BR>
Louisiana. This is a monumental event for LETH which opens the<BR>
floodgates for major project revenues in Louisiana while having a =
parallel<BR>
effect on LETH stock in the form of a huge near-term announcement.<BR>
<BR>
LETH has begun to catch the profit-making attention of investors by<BR>
embracing a major foothold on the global waste problem while a major =
push<BR>
for generating electricity from alternative sources continues to be the =
hot<BR>
topic due to shortages and massive power failures. LETH contains all =
the<BR>
ingredients for major profits as global demand to solve two crisis =
areas,<BR>
waste and electrical energy, reaches unprecedented levels. We view =
this<BR>
perfectly timed convergence of events as the catalyst for additional =
contracts<BR>
that will perpetuate the shattering of the Company's own sales records. =
We<BR>
are seeing substantial gains for early investors in a ground floor =
opportunity<BR>
that carries our highest rating for short-term trading profits.<BR>
