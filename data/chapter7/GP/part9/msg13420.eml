<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>FROM DR. JERRY KINGSMEN<BR>

BURKINA FASO, OUAGADOUGOU<BR>
TEL : 00226 620 614<BR>
WEST AFRICA,<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;ATTN : FRIEND,<BR>
<BR>
I AM DR. JERRY KINGSMEN, THE MANAGER OF BILLS AND EXCHANGE AT THE =
FOREIGN<BR>
REMITTANCE DEPARTMENT OF THE BANK OF AFRICA, BURKINA FASO.<BR>
I AM WRITING THIS LETTER TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND CO-OPERATION TO =
CARRY<BR>
OUT THIS BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY IN MY DEPARTMENT.<BR>
I DISCOVERED AN ABANDONED SUM $15.2M USD FIFTEEN MILLION TWO HUNDRED<BR>
THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS IN AN ACCOUNT THAT BELONGS TO ONE OF =
OUR<BR>
FOREIGN CUSTOMER (MR. MIHAI ALIMANESTIANU) FROM UNITED STATE OF =
AMERICA,<BR>
WHO DIED ALONG WITH HIS ENTIRE FAMILY ON 19TH SEPTEMBER 1989 IN DC10 =
PLANE<BR>
OF THE UTA COMPANY, FLIGHT NUMBER UT 772, BRAZZAVILLE-PARIS.<BR>
SINCE WE GOT INFORMATION ABOUT HIS DEATH, WE HAVE BEEN EXPECTING HIS =
NEXT<BR>
OF KIN TO COME OVER AND CLAIMS HIS MONEY BECAUSE WE CANNOT RELEASE =
THE<BR>
MONEY UNLESS SOMEBODY APPEALS FOR IT AS THE NEXT OF KIN OR ELATIONS TO =
THE<BR>
DECEASED AS INDICATED IN OUR BANKING GUIDELINE.<BR>
UNFORTUNATELY, NEITHER THE FAMILY MEMBERS NOR THE RELATION HAS APPEARED =
TO<BR>
CLAIM THIS MONEY.<BR>
AT THIS DISCOVERY, I NOW DECIDED TO MAKE BUSINESS WITH YOU AND RELEASE =
THE<BR>
MONEY TO YOU AS THE NEXT OF KIN OR RELATION OF THE DECEASED FOR SAFETY =
AND<BR>
SUBSEQUENT SINCE NOBODY IS COMING FOR IT AND I DON'T WANT THIS MONEY TO =
GO<BR>
INTO THE BANKS TREASURY AS AN UNCLAIMED BILL.<BR>
THE BANKING LAW AND GUIDELINES HERE STIPULATED THAT IF SUCH MONEY =
REMAINED<BR>
UNCLAIMED AFTER FOURTEEN YEARS THE MONEY WILL BE TRANSFERRED INTO THE =
BANK<BR>
TREASURY AS AN UNCLAIMED FUND.<BR>
THE REQUEST OF FOREIGNER AS NEXT OF KIN IN THIS BUSINESS IS OCCASIONED =
BY<BR>
THE FACT THAT THE CUSTOMER WAS A FOREIGNER AND A BURKINABE CANNOT STAND =
AS<BR>
NEXT OF KIN TO A FOREIGNER. FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE, I AREED TO OFFER YOU =
30%<BR>
AS MY FOREIGN PARTNER AFTER THE MONEY WILL BE TRANSFER INTO YOUR =
NOMINATED<BR>
BANK ACCOUNT AND 5% WILL BE ASIDE OF ANY EXPENSES DURING THE =
TRANSFER.<BR>
THEREFORE TO ENABLE THE IMMEDIATE TRANSFER OF THE FUND TO YOU AS<BR>
INDICATED, YOU MUST APPLY FIRST TO THE BANK AS A RELATION OR NEXT OF =
KIN<BR>
OF THE ENCASED, INDICATING YOUR BANK INFORMATION WHERE THE MONEY WILL =
BE<BR>
REMITTED.<BR>
I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO HEAR FROM YOU, SO THAT I WILL SEND YOU THE TEXT =
OF<BR>
APPLICATION FORM WHICH YOU WILL FILL-IN YOUR DETAILS WHERE THE MONEY =
WILL<BR>
BE REMITTED AND RESENT TO THE BANK AS NEXT OF KIN OR HIS BUSINESS =
PARTNER<BR>
FOR THE IMMEDIATE CLAIM.<BR>
<BR>
YOURS FAITHFULLY<BR>
DR. JERRY KINGSMEN.<BR>
