A Hollywood producer ws determined to give his mother a birthday =
present<BR>
that would be better than any his brothers were giving her. He heard =
about<BR>
an amazing bird which could talk in twelve languages and sing ten =
famous<BR>
operas. he immediately bought the bird and sent it to his mother. It =
cost<BR>
him $50,000.The day after her birthday, he phoned his mother. &quot;What =
did you<BR>
think of the bird, Mother?&quot; he asked eagerly. his mother =
replied,<BR>
&quot;Delicious!&quot;<BR>
Dick was seven years old, and his sister, Catherine, was five. One =
day<BR>
their mother took them to their aunt's house to play while she went to =
the<BR>
big city to buy some new clothes.The children played for an hour, and =
then<BR>
at half past four their aunt took Dick into the kitchen. She gave him a =
nice<BR>
cake and a knife and said to him, &quot;Now here's a knife, Dick. Cut =
this cake<BR>
in half and give one of the pieces to your sister, but remember to do =
it<BR>
like a gentleman.&quot;&quot;Like a gentleman?&quot; Dick asked. =
&quot;How do gentlemen do<BR>
it?&quot;&quot;They always give the bigger piece to the other =
person.&quot; answered his<BR>
aunt at once.&quot;Oh&quot; said Dick. He thought about this for a few =
seconds. Then<BR>
he took the cake to his sister and said to her,&quot;Cut this cake in =
half,<BR>
Catherine.&quot;.<BR>
