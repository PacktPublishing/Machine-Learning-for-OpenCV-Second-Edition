On Clinton's last trip to Hawaii, he went swimming at Waikiki Beach. He =
got caught in a riptide and was been pulled out to sea. Three young =
surfers swam out to him and brought him to shore. He wanted to reward =
them, and asked what they would like. The first said he wanted to be a =
fighter pilot, and Clinton said he would get him an appointment to the =
A. F. Academy. The second one said he wanted to command a submarine. =
"Fine, I'll get you into the Naval Academy." The third said he wanted to =
be buried at Arlington. Clinton looked puzzled and asked why such a =
young person was concerned about where he would be buried. "Because", =
said the surfer, "my father is a Vietnam Veteran, and when I go home and =
tell him I saved your life, he's going to kill me."<br>
Three guys are convicted of a very serious crime, and they're all =
sentenced to twenty years in solitary confinement. They're each allowed =
one thing to bring into the cell with them. The first guy asks for a big =
stack of books. The second guy asks for his wife. And the third guy asks =
for two hundred cartons of cigarettes. At the end of the twenty years, =
they open up the first guy's cell . He comes out and says, "I studied so =
hard. I'm so bright now, I could be a lawyer. It was terrific." They =
open up the second guy's door. He comes out with his wife , and they've =
got five new kids. He says. "It was the greatest thing of my life. My =
wife and I have never been so close. I have a beautiful new family. I =
love i t." They open up the third guy's door, and he's slapping at his =
pockets, going "Anybody got a match?"<br>
An American attorney had just finished a guest lecture at a law school =
in Italy when an Italian lawyer approached him and asked, "Is it true =
that a person can fall down on a sidewalk in your county and then sue =
the landowners for lots of money?" Told that it was true, the lawyer =
turned to his partner and started speaking rapidly in Italian. When they =
stopped, the American attorney asked if they wanted to go to America to =
practice law. "No, no," one replied. "We want to go to America and fall =
down on sidewalks." <br>
A local bar was so sure that its bartender was the strongest man around =
that they offered a standing $1,000 bet. The bartender would squeeze a =
lemon until all the juice ran into a glass, and hand the lemon to a =
patron. Anyone who could squeeze one more drop of juice out would win =
the money. Many people had tried over time (weightlifters, longshoremen, =
etc.) but nobody could do it. One day a scrawny little man wearing thick =
glasses and a polyester suit came in and said in a tiny, squeaky voice, =
"I'd like to try the bet." After the laughter had died down, the =
bartender said okay, grabbed a lemon, and squeezed away. Then he handed =
the wrinkled remains of the rind to the little man. But the crowd's =
laughter turned to total silence as the man clenched his fist around the =
lemon and six drops fell into the glass. As the crowd cheered, the =
bartender paid the $1,000, and asked the little man, "What do you do for =
a living? Are you a lumberjack, a weightlifter, or what?" The man =
replied, "I work for the IRS."<br>
