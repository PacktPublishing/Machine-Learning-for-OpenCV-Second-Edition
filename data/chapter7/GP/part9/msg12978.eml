on this spring morning. The sound of song birds greet the new
born day, as rays from the sun pierce the darkness of the
forest floor.<br>.A rabbit yawns, and runs his fingers through
his hair scratching a itch. He sits up, looking about. He says
to his self. <br>"It is nice to hear the sounds of spring once
more."
The sound of his tummy rumbling reminds him of how long it
has been since he had anything to eat.<br> He has walked quite
a distance the night before, and is not familiar with the
forest he finds his self in.<br> After eating the last bit of
bread he saved from the previous day. He stands to survey what
he can of the forest, and gathers his few belongings into his
backpack.<br> He decides to push on thinking. "I must find
food, and work soon." Turning quickly with a hop. He blinks to
see the top of a tree laying across the path. <br>A skunk runs
up, and asks. "You ok fellow?" Chip scratches a ear just a
bit., and says. "I think so, but that tree nearly got me." The
skunk holds out a paw, and says."Sorry.. But that tree went
quicker than I planned." Chip nods, and says."I understand.
<br>It's happened to me also."
Chip takes the skunks paw with his, and says. My name is Chip
Sty. <br> The skunk smiles as he shakes Chips paw. Then says.
"Glad to meet you Chip. Furres around here just call me Mac."
Chip nods. "Nice to meet you, Mac.  Would you be needing any
help.<br> I am in need of food, and shelter."  The skunk thinks
a moment. Then says. "Well since I nearly fell a tree on you,
It's the least I can do to you some food, and shelter for the
night, <br>and I could use a little help cutting this tree into
firewood."

font-size:1px;">While following the trail through the forest.
He thinks about the two foxes that tried to steal his backpack
a few days earlier. <br> He stops upon hearing a noise, he
looks all around. Then moves quickly along.. He says to his
self. "I hope I don't meet any robbers."<br>
After what seems like hours. The trail breaks out into the
open, and there before Chip, stretches a beautiful valley with
grassy fields, <br>and a small stream flowing through it. Chip
smiles, and says."Sure is peaceful here." He follows the trail
wishing he could find some berries along the way. In the
distance he can see a small house set near a grove of trees. He
thinks.<br> "Maybe I can find work there."Chip smiles, and
says. Thanks a lot, and I would be glad to help. Mac grins, and
says. "it's close to lunchtime, we can have a bite to eat
first, and I will show you where you can bed down as well."
<br>Chip nods, and walks with the skunk up the path to the
little house.
Chip follows him through the door into a small room that
has a single table, <br>two chairs, small bed, and a large rock
fireplace.   In the fireplace a pot of vegetable soup simmers
over a small fire.  Chip sniffs the air as the skunk grabs two
bowls, and spoons from a large wooden cabinet that stands in
the far corner.
Mac smiles as he notices the rabbit sniffing the soup.<br>
He walks over placing one of the bowls on the table. He then
asks. "You like vegetable soup fellow?" Chip looks at the
skunk, and says. "Oh yes, and it smells very good." The skunk
fills one bowl,<br> then puts it on the table, and says. "Sit
yourself down, and have some."
