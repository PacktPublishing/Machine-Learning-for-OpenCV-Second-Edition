<BR>
Dear friend,<BR>
<BR>
Having gotten your contact details through the Internet over the years, =
that you have been doing all what is neccessary to deserve trust, =
coupled with my deep interest to invest in your country, i decided to =
contact and solicit your mutual assistance at all cost.<BR>
I am Mr. shola martins, Branch Manager, First Atlantic Trust Bank Plc of =
Nigeria. In January 6th 1999, One Mr. Claude Brian Best, A British =
National, a consultant/contractor with the Federal Ministry of Mines and =
Power made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit,&nbsp; valued at =
US$11,500,000.00 (Eleven Million,Five Hundred Thousand United States =
Dollars), for twelve (12) calender months in my Bank branch.<BR>
&nbsp;Upon maturity, we sent a routine notification to his forwarding =
address but got no reply.&nbsp; After a month, we sent a reminder and =
finally we discovered from his contract employers that Mr. Claude Brian =
Best died from an automobile accident. On further investigation,I found =
out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his =
next of kin was fruitless.<BR>
I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Claude =
Brian Best did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his =
official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.<BR>
This sum of US$11,500,000.00 is still in my Bank and the interest is =
being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.&nbsp; =
No one will ever come forward to claim it. In accordance with the =
Nigerian Federal Law, at the expiration of 4 (four) years, the money =
will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody =
applies to claim the fund.<BR>
Consequently,&nbsp; I shall present you as a foreign partner to stand in =
as the next of kin to Mr. Claude Brian Best so that you and i can =
benefit from the fruits of this old man's labour to enhance Humanitarian =
Organisation World wide.&nbsp;<BR>
Upon accecptance, I shall send to you either by fax or e-mail a scan =
copy of the first atlantic trust bank plc &quot;Next of Kin Payment =
Application Form&quot; as well the Detailed Information on how this =
business would successfully transacted.<BR>
&nbsp;We shall employ the services of an attorney for the drafting and =
notorization of the WILL and to obtain all the relevant papers in your =
name for the necessary documentations for payment approval in my bank =
headquaters and in your favour.<BR>
&nbsp;The money will be share in the ratio of 60% for me, 35% for you =
and 5% for any arising contingencies during the process of this =
transaction.<BR>
There is no risk involved as i will use my position as the Bank Branch =
Manager to secure approvals and guarantee the successful execution of =
this transaction and it will take only&nbsp; 7-10 working days.Please =
you must observe utmost confidentiality<BR>
If this proposal interest you, please reply me immediately via my =
private email address below and please include your private phone number =
for voice contact and fax number so i can provide you with more details =
and relevant documents that will help you understand the =
transaction.&nbsp;<BR>
