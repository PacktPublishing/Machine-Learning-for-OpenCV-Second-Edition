                            Market Mover Stock Report

   Urgent Investor Bulletin Revealing the Most Undervalued Stock on the =
OTCBB

                               Issue 4|March 2004

                   Life Energy and Technology Holdings, Inc.



Market Mover Stock  Report's Last Pick  (CWTD) exploded from  $1.19 to =
$9.20,  a
gain of over 670% in 5 days (Feb 12 - 17)!!!=20

Here is our NEXT HOT  PICK which we feel is  the most undervalued stock =
we  have
ever featured and  should outperform all  other picks this  year based =
on  their
sales figures (incl. a backlog of over $100 Million), incredibly solid  =
numbers,
and low outstanding share total.=20

Life Energy and Technology Holdings, Inc.
(OTCBB: LETH)
Current Price: 2.30
Near-Term Target: 8.00
Projected High for '04: 15.00

We are  sending this  URGENT INVESTOR  BULLETIN REVEALING  THE MOST  =
UNDERVALUED
STOCK  ON THE  OTCBB to  our millions  of subscribers  for substantial  =
profits
immediately! Sales  orders received  by LETH  exceed $150  Million over =
the past
year while major news was just  released that adds multi-millions to the =
 bottom
line. LETH has experienced a recent  spike in price and volume =
indicating  heavy
accumulation of shares which  is a sign of  even bigger things to  come =
for this
emerging  world leader  in the  conversion of  waste materials  into =
electrical
energy, an industry with such high global demand that it is impossible =
to assign
a value to the size of the market.=20

(Mar 9 '04)  Urgent News Update:  LETH Announces the  Sale of Two  (2) =
Biosphere
Process Systems to Procura International Limited for $14 Million with an =
 Option
for the Sale of an Additional 98 Systems Over the Next 24 Months.=20

Solving a Dual Crisis - Waste and Energy:=20

LETH is utilizing the unique  proprietary technology of their Biosphere  =
Process
System to generate revenue from the disposal of a wide variety of waste =
products
at 5 to 7 tons per hour which makes a major impact on the global waste  =
problem.
This profitable and  environmentally safe process  converts into clean,  =
"green"
electricity such waste materials as Municipal Solid Waste, agricultural  =
wastes,
forestry wastes, medical  wastes, industrial wastes,  sewage sludge, =
shale  oil,
sour natural gas, and the huge market of used tires. LETH profits from =
the  sale
of  electricity created  from the  waste conversion  on a  continuous =
basis  by
generating 5  to 10  mega-watts per  hour of  electricity which  is then =
sold to
replenish the local or national grid.=20

(Mar  3  '04) LETH  Release  Major Product  Delivery  and Net  Profit  =
News LETH
delivered 12 Biosphere Process  Systems which resulted in  a net profit =
of  $3.5
Million, the equivalent of .12 cents per share. LETH is scheduled to =
receive  an
additional $7 Million translating into  an additional .24 cents per  =
share which
is the balance of this completed contract over the next 6 months. The =
net profit
per share  from just  this single  contract would  value the  stock =
above  $6 by
calculating the .36 cents per share total at an average industry PE of =
18 - 22.=20

Examining LETH - By The Numbers

Total Assets: 36.8 Million =3D 1.26 per share of assets
Cash: 23.4 Million =3D .80 cents per share of cash
Shares Outstanding: 29 million (down from 31.8 million) after 2.8 =
million shares
retired in Feb. '04
Additional Shares to be Retired: 1.3 million per Company press release
Estimated Shares in Float: 7 million
Completed Biosphere Process Systems Now in Operation: 26

Record Backlog of Sales for LETH:=20

During the  past year,  over 20  additional Biosphere  Process Systems =
have been
ordered, which upon completion represents a backlog exceeding over $100  =
Million
in upcoming sales. Many of these contractual agreements include options =
for  the
purchase of additional  Biosphere Systems in  the future once  the =
initial order
has been completed. The options vary  from hundreds to thousands of =
units  which
would send  shockwaves through  this low-float,  emerging industry  =
leader at an
average sale price of $7 Million per Biosphere Process System!=20

LETH's Blue Chip Partner - Fortifying the System:=20

LETH is an alliance partner with  Tetra Tech, Inc. (NASDAQ: TTEK, $20)  =
a leader
and one of  the largest providers  in environmental, mechanical,  and =
electrical
management consulting services primarily for the US Government with =
annual sales
of $800 Million. Tetra Tech  will coordinate the securing of  necessary =
permits,
installation,  and  continuous  worldwide monitoring  of  the  Biosphere =
Process
System for LETH.  Tetra Tech is  now in the  process of obtaining  =
Department of
Environmental  Quality permitting  for the  Biosphere Process  in the  =
state of
Louisiana. This is a  monumental event for LETH  which opens the =
floodgates  for
major project revenues in Louisiana while having a parallel effect on =
LETH stock
in the form of a huge near-term announcement.=20

Stock Set to Explode on Earnings Boom:=20

LETH has the impressive financials and sales already in the pipeline to  =
achieve
record-setting stock price levels in support of the Company's breakout =
year. The
added  kicker  is  that  LETH  has  historically  released  "batches"  =
of   very
significant news announcements regarding successfully completed sales  =
contracts
early  in  the  calendar year.  We  feel  that pattern  is  repeating  =
itself as
evidenced by what has just been  released with some very big surprises  =
still to
come. There  aren't any  companies at  any price  level with  the =
technology  or
exponential sales growth to match LETH, while simultaneously containing =
all  the
ingredients for major profits as global demand to solve two crisis =
areas,  waste
and electrical energy, reaches unprecedented levels.=20
