Equity Spoltight: OSF Financial Services - OSSI<BR>
<BR>
Could OSSI be the next Ditech, Lending Tree, E-Loan, or =
Countrywide?&nbsp; Countrywide UP 23,000% since 1982, 156% in last year =
alone.<BR>
<BR>
2003 saw one of the the biggest booms in real estate history.&nbsp; =
Homeownership is at its highest level ever at 68%, and experts are =
predicting 2004 will be even bigger. In fact, since 2000 the stocks of =
the ten financial companies that dominate mortgages have risen an =
average of 78%.&nbsp; You have all heard of such companies as Ditech, =
Lending Tree, E-Loan, and Countrywide.&nbsp; These companies are riding =
the current wave of record refinancing, posting record revenues and =
phenomenal gains.&nbsp; For you, the investor, it may very well be too =
late to get in on the ground floor of these already well-known =
entities.&nbsp; But is it too late for you to get into this market at =
all?&nbsp; Absolutely not.<BR>
<BR>
OSF Financial Services - OSSI - is just now getting its legs and will =
soon be up and running at full speed.&nbsp; Here is your chance to get =
in while the getting is good.<BR>
<BR>
To illustrate the rise in stock prices per the real estate boom of 2003, =
we can use as an example Countrywide Financial.&nbsp; 77% of =
Countrywide's pre-tax earnings are derived from mortg. banking.&nbsp; =
Net earnings went from 842 million dollars for the 12 months ended =
12/31/2002 to a whopping 2 billion, 373 million dollars for 12 months =
ended 12/31/2003, with diluted earnings per share going from 4.87 in =
2002 to 12.47 in 2003.<BR>
<BR>
52-week Range - 37.96 - 97.30<BR>
<BR>
Fourth quarter highlights include the following:&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
Consolidated net earnings reached 564 million dollars, advancing 121 =
percent over fourth quarter last year.<BR>
<BR>
Earnings per diluted share increased 89 percent over last year to 2.74, =
the Company's second highest quarter on record. Notably, the Company's =
Liquid Yield Option Notes became convertible during the fourth quarter, =
resulting in an upswing in the number of diluted shares outstanding for =
the quarter of 10.4 million. This had a dilutive effect on fourth =
quarter earnings of 0.14 per share and on annual earnings of 0.17 per =
share.<BR>
<BR>
Pre-tax earnings from Diversified Businesses were 246 million dollars, a =
gain of 122 percent over last year's fourth quarter.<BR>
<BR>
INCREDIBLE Gains.<BR>
<BR>
Countrywide Financial was established in 1969, but you can see an =
astounding rise in stock value came last year, coinciding with a never =
before seen real estate boom.&nbsp; Just last year alone stock value was =
up an est. %156.<BR>
<BR>
According to Shawn Tully from FORTUNE Magazine:<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Most amazing of all is that Countrywide boasts the best stock =
market performance of any financial services company in the FORTUNE 500, =
measured from the start of the Great Bull Market over two decades ago. =
During that period, it has delivered investors a 23,000% =
return&#151;yes, 23,000% &#151;or 30% a year, so that shareholders now =
have over $230,000 for every $1,000 they invested in late 1982. It =
handily beat superstars WaMu, Wal-Mart, and Warren Buffett's Berkshire =
Hathaway (all around 15,000%).&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The time has come and gone to get in early with Countrywide, but the =
time is right for OSSI.<BR>
