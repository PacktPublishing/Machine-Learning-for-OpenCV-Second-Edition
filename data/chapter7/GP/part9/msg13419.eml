<P>Attn; </P>
<P>This proposal to you is strictly<BR>confidential, with due respect =
.Sorry at this<BR>perceived confusion or stress you may have =
receiving<BR>this letter from me, Since we have not known =
ourselves<BR>or met previously. Despite that, I am constrained =
to<BR>write you this letter because of the urgency of it.<BR><BR>I am =
Mrs. Bennie Khobe, the wife of late Gen. Maxwell<BR>Khobe former ECOMOG =
[West African peacekeeping force]<BR>commander who died in the Sierra =
Leone civil<BR>disturbance [War]. My three daughters and I =
are<BR>trapped in obnoxious custom traditional rites. We =
have<BR>suffered maltreatment and untold hardship in the hands<BR>of my =
late husbands family, simple because I did not<BR>bear a male child for =
my late husband By tradition,<BR>all that my husband had, [wealth] =
belongs to his<BR>brothers/family and myself is to be married by =
his<BR>immediate younger brother. They have taken all that I<BR>suffered =
with my husband to acquire including<BR>treasure, houses and his bank =
accounts closed by them.<BR>I wanted to escape to the United State of =
America<BR>[USA} with my children on exile, but again they<BR>conspired =
and stole my international passport and<BR>other traveling documents to =
further frustrate me.<BR>Thank God, two weeks ago, I received Key Text =
Code<BR>[KTC} from SECURITIES COMPANY, that my husband<BR>deposited U.S =
$25.5 Million [twenty five Million five </P>
<P>Hundred Thousand United States Dollars] cash with =
this<BR>company.<BR><BR>It has therefore, become very necessary and =
urgent to<BR>contact some one, a foreigner like you to help =
me<BR>receive/secure these funds overseas and to help invest<BR>it on =
our behalf as well, while we find a way of<BR>getting out to meet with =
you in your country.<BR><BR>These funds are kept on a CODE with the =
Securities<BR>Company to avoid detection, seizure or diversion. =
I<BR>have had several telephone discussions with the<BR>Assistant =
Director of the Securities Company, Mr.<BR>Gilbert Scott who has express =
willingness to help me<BR>on meeting the company&#8217;s demand. This is =
why I have<BR>contacted you to help save my children and I, =
receive<BR>these funds on our behalf. But, you would need to give<BR>me =
sufficient assurance that if you help me, you would<BR>not divert the =
funds. My children and I have resolved<BR>to give you 20% of the total =
sum. This is all my<BR>children and I have got to live on. Please, I =
have<BR>reposed my confidence in you and hope you will not<BR>disappoint =
me.<BR><BR>I will forward you the contact of Mr. Gilbert Scott<BR>for =
you to contact him and ask him the possibility of<BR>receiving this fund =
on our behalf as the sole<BR>beneficiary look forward to your urgent =
response.<BR><BR>Best Personal Regards.<BR><BR>Mrs. Bennie =
Khobe.<BR></P><BR> <span style=3D'color:#000000;font-family:arial; =
