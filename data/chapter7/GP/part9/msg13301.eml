you as a surprise because we have not met before either physically or =

Head of my Community, JESSE (an oil rich town)in Nigeria. My late =
husband=12s community produces 3.5% of the total crude oil production in =
Nigeria and 0.5% of the Dollar value of each barrel is paid to my =
husband as royalty by the Federal Government.My husband was also the =
Chairman of OMPADEC,Jesse branch.In his position as the Royal head and =
Chairman of the OMPADEC, Jesse branch,he made some money which he left =
for me and our children as the only thing to inherit. The money is =
Twelve Million USDollars($12M).Though this said fund accumulated between =
the period 1976-1998. Due to poor banking system in Nigeria and =
political instability as a result of past Military rules (1985-1999), he =
deposited this Money in a Strong Room/safe with an open beneficiary in =
Apex Bank of Nigeria pending when he would finish arrangement to =
transfer it abroad as a CONTRACT PAYMENT.&nbsp;<BR>
He was planning this when he died late last year of Heart Attack.THE =
PROPOSAL: Just before my husband died he called my attention to the =
money and charged me to look for a foreigner who would assist me in the =
transfer / investment of the funds abroad. So l would be very grateful =
if you could accept to help me archieve this great objective.I promise =
to give you 20% of the total funds transferred to your vital bank =
account as compensation for your assistance. Five percent(5%)would be =
set aside to take care of all expenses we may incur during the =
transaction. To indicate your interest, contact me urgently and =
confidentially for more information and the roles you will play in this =
business. All the legal information concerning this Money will be sent =
to you as soon as we agree together.Send your reply through this mail =
