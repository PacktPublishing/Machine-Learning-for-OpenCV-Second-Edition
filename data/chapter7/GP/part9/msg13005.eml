RE:TRANSFER OF (USD 26 MILLION)<BR>
I want to transfer to overseas ($ 26,000.000.00 USD) Twenty six million =
United States Dollars) from Ecobank, Benin. I have the courage to ask =
for your assistance to handle this important and confidential business =
to provide either an existing bank account or to set up a new Bank a/c =
immediately to receive this money, even an empty a/c can serve to =
receive this funds quitely.<BR>
I am DR KENNETH OKOH the accountant/auditor in Ecobank,Benin and =
personal confidant to Dr. Ravindra F. Shah who died together with his =
wife Dr.Mrs.Manjula Parikh-Shah in a planecrash on the 1st Oct. 2003 on =
their way to attend a wedding in Boston.<BR>
Mr. Ravindra F. Shah, is an American, a physician and industrialist, he =
died last year without having any beneficiary to his assets including =
his account herein BENIN which he opened in a Eco Bank, Benin in the =
year 2000 as his personal savings for the purpose of expansion and =
developement of his company before his untimely death in 2003. The =
amount involved is (USD<BR>
26,000.000.00 USD) Twenty six million United States Dollars and no other =
person knows about this account. I am contacting you for me to transfer =
this funds to your account as the beneficiary, I am only contacting you =
as a foreigner because this money cannot be approved to a local person =
here, without valid international foreign passport, but can only be =
approved to any foreigner with valid international passport or drivers =
license and foreign a/c because the money is in US Dollars and the =
former owner of the a/c Mr.Ravindra F. Shah is a foreigner too, and as =
such the money can only be approved into a foreign a/c.<BR>
<BR>
However, I am revealing this to you with belief in God that you will =
never let me down in this business.You are the first and the only person =
that I am contacting for this business, so please reply urgently so that =
I will inform you the next step to take urgently. Send also your private =
telephone and fax number including the full details of the account to be =
used for the transfer. I need your full co-operation to make this work =
because the management is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner =
who has correct information of this account, which I will give to you, =
upon your positive response and once I am convinced that you are capable =
and will meet up with<BR>
instruction of a key bank official who is deeply involved with me in =
this business.<BR>
<BR>
At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 40% of the total =
amount,60% will be for me. I look forward to your earliest reply =
through<BR>
my Email or you call me on phone.<BR>
