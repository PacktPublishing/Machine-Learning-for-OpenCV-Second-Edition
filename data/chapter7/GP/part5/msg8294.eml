<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>&nbsp; Dear Uncle George Paliouras .<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; I am Miss Theresa Momoh a 22 years old girl from<BR>
Sierra-leone,daughter to late Mr. Clement Momoh a once<BR>
minister in Sierra-leone who was later killed during<BR>
the problem in Sierra-leone with my only brother, now<BR>
i am in Dakar,Senegal taking refuge with my mother<BR>
because after the death of my father my uncles started<BR>
to persecute us about my fathers properties which he<BR>
later snatched from us under treathning,now there is<BR>
nothing we can do than to run for our lives which is<BR>
very important to us.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; Now I am in critical condition with my mother some<BR>
one to be under refugee with her mother,compare with<BR>
senegal where things are very hard every thing is<BR>
high.You know nowadays girls in my condition go for<BR>
prostitution whcih I cannot do.I am supposed to be in<BR>
school by now but there is nothing I can do,infact you<BR>
are the one i am looking for my life which I know that<BR>
you can not disappoint me in life.Now the only thing<BR>
that makes me to feel happy at times is that my father<BR>
left the sum of $3.2 million US Dollars (Three million<BR>
two hundred US Dollars) in in a finance house,which I<BR>
am the next of kin and the whole documments and<BR>
contacts are with me because my father loved me very<BR>
much that was why he gave me every information about<BR>
his fund<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; Now i have called the Finance house and they denied<BR>
me releasing the fund to me due to my refugee<BR>
status,they only adviced me to solicit for a reputable<BR>
organisation or a reliable someone who can stand as my<BR>
trusted nominee, that was the reason why i had to use<BR>
this media to contact you for help, if you are<BR>
interested in helping me and my sick mum please feel<BR>
free to reply so that we can start making arrangements<BR>
of transfering the fund to your account,.Meanwhile as<BR>
soon as the fund is been transfered to your account<BR>
you will send part of the money for me to start<BR>
preparing for my travelling documents to meet you.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; I will want to continues my education in your<BR>
country,if you feel adopting me will enable my<BR>
situation please i wouldn'nt mind been your adopted<BR>
son,I promise to bring happiness to your family.You<BR>
can contact me with my alternative e-mail address<BR>
which is (paumomoh@yahoo.com) or<BR>
