to censure that have a heart to help.
<BR><BR>There is no excitement anywhere in the world, short of war, to =
match the excitement of the American presidential campaign.

When wealth is lost, nothing is lost when health is lost, something is =
lost when character is lost, all is lost.<BR>I think your whole life =
shows in your face and you should be proud of that.



<BR><BR>Love is not a matter of counting the years -- it's making the =
years count.A goose flies by a chart which the Royal Geographical =
Society could not mend.


<br><br>Give a man health and a course to steer and he'll never stop to =
trouble about whether he's happy or not.



<BR><BR>Fame has also this great drawback, that if we pursue it, we must =
direct our lives so as to please the fancy of men.<br><br>There is no =
fear in love but perfect love casts out fear.

<br>Death, so called, is a thing which makes men weep, and yet a third =
of life is passed in sleep.



<BR><BR>Love shall be our token love be yours and love be =
mine.<BR><BR>Our friends don't see our faults, or conceal them, or =
soften them.<br>Disease is an experience of a so-called mortal mind. It =
is fear made manifest on the body.



<br><br>I've learned that something constructive comes from every =
defeat.
<br><br>The heart of a mother is a deep abyss at the bottom of which you =
will always find forgiveness.



<br>Coalitions though successful have always found this, that their =
triumph has been brief.



Anger is a momentary madness, so control your passion or it will control =
you.
<BR>They say that the best defense is offense, and I intend to start =
offending right now.<br><A =
