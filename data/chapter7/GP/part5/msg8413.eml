<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Hello<BR>
<BR>
RE: CONFIDENTIAL ASSISTANCE<BR>
<BR>
First I must solicit your confidence in this<BR>
transaction. I am a<BR>
highly<BR>
placed official working with the ministry of state for<BR>
finance and<BR>
economic planning here in Banjul, Gambia, west .Africa<BR>
my department,<BR>
the treasury, does transactions that run into several<BR>
hundresds of<BR>
millions of dollars quaterly. Myself and two other<BR>
colleagues in this<BR>
department are currently in need of a silent foreign<BR>
partner, whose<BR>
influence and bank account we can use, to transfer the<BR>
sum of twelve<BR>
Million Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars<BR>
(US$12,500,000.00) This funds<BR>
accrued legitimately but discretely to us as<BR>
commission from foreign<BR>
contracts through our private connections. The funds<BR>
is presently<BR>
waiting to be remitted by our offshore funds managers<BR>
to any foreign<BR>
beneficiary<BR>
cleared for payment. However by virtue of our<BR>
positions as civil<BR>
servants in our country we cannot acquire this money<BR>
directly, in our<BR>
names. We are not allowed by the civil service code of<BR>
conduct to own<BR>
or<BR>
operate bank account outside our shores, on the other<BR>
hand it is not<BR>
safe for us to keep the money here due to our unstable<BR>
political<BR>
environment in<BR>
this part of the world.<BR>
<BR>
I have been delegated as a matter of trust by my<BR>
colleagues to look<BR>
for<BR>
an overseas silent partner in whose account we would<BR>
transfer the<BR>
us$12,500,000.00 to, for our mutual benefit, hence the<BR>
reason for this<BR>
email. I am requesting that you assist us as our<BR>
silent partner and<BR>
receive the funds in your account for us on trust. We<BR>
propose to share<BR>
as<BR>
follows, 20% to you as commision and 80 for us. You<BR>
will be free to<BR>
take<BR>
your commission immediately the funds hit your<BR>
account. since our<BR>
objective for now is to invest the money, it would be<BR>
appreciated if<BR>
you<BR>
can also of assistance by advising on short and long<BR>
term investment<BR>
possibilities your country. Should it not be<BR>
convenient for you to<BR>
assist with investing, we can end our cooperation<BR>
after you hand over<BR>
to<BR>
our<BR>
percentage of the money. The transaction although<BR>
discrete is<BR>
legitimate, the money will be transferred to your<BR>
account with all necessary back-up<BR>
documents showing legitimacy and source origin of<BR>
funds. The transfer<BR>
will be effected within seven working days to be<BR>
completd. I plead<BR>
with<BR>
you on one issue, whether you are interested or not<BR>
please do not<BR>
expose this information to any one else. I confirm<BR>
that the<BR>
transaction<BR>
is legitimate and without any risks either of us.<BR>
Please give me your<BR>
response immediately while keeping everything<BR>
confidential.<BR>
<BR>
Yours Sincerely,<BR>
<BR>
Musa Bello.<BR>
