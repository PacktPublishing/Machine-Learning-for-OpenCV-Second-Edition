<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Hello,<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;We tried contacting you awhile ago about your low interest mortage =
rate.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;You have qualified for the lowest rate in years.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;You could get over $300,000 for as little as $600 a month!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;Bad credit? Doesn't matter, low rates are fixed no matter =
what!<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;To consult the mortage broker for free click below:<BR>
