<BR>
1. GET LEAN: Loss of fat and increase in muscle mass combine for up to =
20 pound shift in body composition. This equates to a general feeling of =
physical well being, a stronger libido, and improved self image.<BR>
2. GET ENERGETIC: Without a need for the afternoon food cravings of =
sweets, caffeine, stimulants or nicotine, HGH patients have more energy. =
This improves both their self control image and their general health =
state (because they exercise).<BR>
3. GET SMART: An interesting yet unproved side-effect of HGH has been =
the return of mental acuity and a &quot;sharp&quot; memory. Such HGH =
improves the vascular and intracellular nutrient support for cells, it =
is not surprizing that this has been reported by many individuals.<BR>
