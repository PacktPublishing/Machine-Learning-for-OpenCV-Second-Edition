Personality is everything in art and poetry.



Human beings must have action and they will make it if they cannot find =

Civilization is just a slow process of learning to be kind.<BR>One who =
gains strength by overcoming obstacles possesses the only strength which =
can overcome adversity.

Learn to listen. Opportunity could be knocking at your door very softly.
