of using deceit and cunning grow continually weaker and less effective =
to the user.


If you do not wish to be lied to, do not ask questions. If there were no =
questions, there would be no lies.



<br>Real genius is nothing else but the supernatural virtue of humility =
in the domain of thought.



<br><br>We can recognize the dawn and the decline of love by the =
uneasiness we feel when alone together.
<BR><BR>One should never risk a joke, even of the mildest and most =
unexceptional charters, except among people of culture and wit.


<BR><BR>Beware of all enterprises that require a new set of =
clothes.<BR>Sharing food with another human being is an intimate act =
that should not be indulged in lightly.
I love being in therapy. It's just constantly fulfilling for =
me.<BR><BR>It is only the modern that ever becomes old-fashioned.
<BR>Remember that credit is money.

<br>Grace is free sovereign favor to the ill-deserving.
<br><br>The world may be full of fourth-rate writers but it's also full =
of fourth-rate readers.



<BR>We, and all others who believe in freedom as deeply as we do, would =
rather die on our feet than live on our knees.



<br><br>Time passes, and little by little everything that we have spoken =
in falsehood becomes true.<br>Humility is often a false front we employ =
to gain power over others.



<br><br>In the end we retain from our studies only that which we =
practically apply.


<BR>Nobody can make you feel inferior without your consent.<BR>It's =
motive alone which gives character to the actions of men.
