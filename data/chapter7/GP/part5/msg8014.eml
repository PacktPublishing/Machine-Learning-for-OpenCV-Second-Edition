<BR>
This development will be up to a maximum 90Mw in size and cost upwards =

mil|i0n in development expenditures. Once completed, this Wind Park will =
supply<BR>
upwards of 170,OOO Mw of e|ectricity annua|ly for Po|and and the =
European<BR>
Community. This is enough green energy to supply upwards of 25,00O homes =

e|ectricity and offset near|y 170,000 tonnes of Greenhouse gases. Tota| =
gross<BR>
electric sales over a 2O-year period are estimated at over $45O mil|iOn =
