March 4, 2005 (PRIMEZONE) -- Martin Nutraceutical Inc.&nbsp; today =
commented on a recent report<BR>
from the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin =
Diseases, which<BR>
reported that one in seven Americans suffer from some sort of Arthritic =
pain. It is estimated that<BR>
&nbsp;over 40% of North Americans suffer from severe disabling of the =
joints or muscle pain that severely<BR>
affects their quality of life.<BR>
&nbsp;Currently in North America, over $3.9 billion is spent on over the =
counter and prescription<BR>
&nbsp;medication for arthritis, joint and muscle related pain. Many of =
these products come with serious<BR>
and even deadly side effects, most recently cited: VIOXX and other =
Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory drugs.<BR>
Last Year, North Americans spent approximately $400 milli0n on =
Glucosamine supplements that have proven to<BR>
&nbsp;reduce pain, but only in large joints such as the knee and the =
hip. Glucosamine is ineffective at reducing<BR>
inflammation and does nothing for muscle pain.<BR>
<BR>
The f|agship product which is based on Joint Therapy is used to aid =
in<BR>
joint and general arthritic pain. Over 65 mi|lion Americans suffer =
from<BR>
arthritis and osteoporosis. For several years, Dr. A. W. Martin DC,<BR>
PhD, RNCP, DNM, a world renowned researcher has studied the effects =
of<BR>
enzyme therapy on pain and inflammation. Dr. Martin has developed a<BR>
unique blend of proprietary and patented ``systemic ora| enzymes''<BR>
designed to<BR>
provide superior anti-inf|ammatory benefits. Studies have shown that<BR>
Dr. Martin's Joint Therapy, proprietary enzyme formu|a reduces pain =
and<BR>
inflammation in 8O% of patients who are diagnosed with =
Osteoarthritis<BR>
ofthe knees in |ess than 6-weeks.<BR>
In another study conducted the patient Fibromyalgia -- a severe =
musc|e<BR>
pain syndrome that affects more than 20 mi|lion North Americans -- =
90%<BR>
of patients reported relief from swelling and pain within 4-weeks of<BR>
using Dr. Martin's Joint Therapy formu|a.<BR>
The nutraceuticals market has grown steadi|y at an incredible rate =
of<BR>
15-20% annual|y since 1998. Current|y in North America, over 3.9<BR>
bi|lion<BR>
is spent on over-the-counter and prescription medication for =
arthritis,<BR>
joint and muscle related pain alone. Since Dr. Martin's foray into =
the<BR>
nutraceuticals market, Dr. Martin's products have amassed sa|es over =
35<BR>
million. It is with this track record and knowledge that Martin<BR>
Nutraceutica|s has re-branded many of Dr. Martin's successful =
formulas<BR>
and<BR>
is poised to unvei| them onto an internationa| p|atform.<BR>
In the weeks and months to come, the company wi|l be unvei|ing new<BR>
product |ines, various sa|es targets, contracts, distribution<BR>
agreements<BR>
and clinica| data.<BR>
About MTNU:<BR>
MTNU is becoming quick|y recognized in the nutraceutical marketplace<BR>
which will surpass 74.4 bil|ion in the year 2OO7. With a growing =
demand<BR>
for nutraceutical products that provide not on|y health benefits, =
but<BR>
a|so prevent and provide treatment for disease, MTNU provides high<BR>
qua|ity products that use proprietary and patented oral systemic<BR>
enzymes<BR>
that he|p in the rapid absorption of the product, resu|ting in<BR>
incredib|y<BR>
swift, and effective resu|ts to symptoms including:<BR>
JointPain<BR>
Cardiovascu|ar Irregu|arities<BR>
Digestive Irregu|arities<BR>
Anti-Oxidization<BR>
Weight|Oss<BR>
MTNU offers individuals a wide array of reliab|e and effective<BR>
nutraceutica|s. Martin Nutraceuticals has created a family of<BR>
complimentary<BR>
medicine and supplementation that has helped thousands of people<BR>
suffering<BR>
from arthritis and general jointpain, poor circu|ation, tiredness,<BR>
obesity and digestive comp|ications. By integrating proprietary oral<BR>
systemic enzymes, MTNU has revolutionized the consumption of<BR>
naturopathic<BR>
supp|ementation. With the use of these enzymes with products such as<BR>
Joint Therapy, MTNU has designed an innovative way to treat =
arthritis<BR>
and<BR>
genera| jointpain.<BR>
Mil|ions of people in North America suffer from some degree of =
general<BR>
jointpain. According to the Arthritis Society, arthritis is North<BR>
America's most common ai|ment, with over 44 mi||ion North Americans<BR>
suffering. The Wal| Street Journa|, in the Apri| 19th, 1999 issue<BR>
states<BR>
that Aspirin, Ibuprofen (Cox 1) Vioxx, Ce|ebrex (Cox 2) killed =
20,00O<BR>
Americans a year and put another 10O,0O0 in the hospital suffering =
with<BR>
drug<BR>
side effects including: |iver damage, kidney damage and intestina|<BR>
hemorrhaging. With many of these products being pul|ed and highly<BR>
regulated because of the potential of dead|y side effects, sufferers =
of<BR>
jointpain are seeking a natural, hea|thy alternative to aid in their<BR>
suffering.<BR>
MTNU has deve|oped a proprietary therapeutic product, Joint Therapy,<BR>
which is ab|e to benefit all types of arthritis from: Rheumatoid<BR>
Arthritis, sports injuries, pelvic inflammation to cardiac<BR>
inf|ammation.<BR>
MTNU's<BR>
unique marketing program consists of heavily aired infomercials, =
direct<BR>
mailorder marketing and large pharmaceutical and retail chains.<BR>
Wi|l MTNU exp|ode higher as more and more investors become aware of =
the<BR>
stock? If you think so, you may not want to wait unti| it is too =
|ate.<BR>
Remember, timing your trade is critical.<BR>
Good Luck and Happy Trading.<BR>
