It takes more than just a good looking body. You've got to have the =
heart and soul to go with it.

<BR>Mere color, unspoiled by meaning, and unallied with definite form, =
can speak to the soul in a thousand different ways.



<BR>Some memories are realities, and are better than anything that can =
ever happen to one again.


<BR><BR>Treat employees like partners, and they act like partners.

<br>Loving people live in a loving world. Hostile people live in a =
hostile world. Same world.<BR><BR>Washington is a city of people doing =
badly what should not be done at all.


<br><br>Poor little Foal of an oppressed race! I love the languid =
patience of thy face.



<br><br>When men make gods, there is no God!
<br>It is better to know nothing than to know what ain't so.



<BR>There comes a time when suddenly you realize that laughter is =
something you remember and that you were the one laughing.



<br><br>To do easily what is difficult for others is the mark of talent. =
To do what is impossible for talent is the mark of genius.

<BR>A little man often cast a long shadow.<br>The nation's honor is =
dearer than the nation's comfort yes, than the nation's life itself.
<BR><BR>God is only a great imaginative experience.



<br>In the country of the blind, the one-eyed man is King.


<br>One should die proudly when it is no longer possible to live =
proudly.



<br><br>Two dogs strive for a bone and the third one runs off with =
it.<BR><BR>What you do not want others to do to you, do not do to =
others.<br><A =
