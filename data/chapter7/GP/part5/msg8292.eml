<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Hi Friend,<BR>
<BR>
In recent times over the radio in AMERICA or even in ASIA you must =
have&nbsp; heard about my family regarding huge sums of money stacked in =
foreign banks in different names for business. I believe, is a legacy we =
came to meet, when my late Husband became the head of state. It does not =
matter whether you are small or big but your ability to help me sort out =
things is mostly needed now. I do not justify myself but it has =
happened, so i need you to help me and my family survive in life.Thus it =
is with hope that I write to&nbsp; seek your help in the context =
below.<BR>
<BR>
I am Hajia Mariam Abacha, wife of Nigeria's former head of state; =
Late<BR>
General Sani Abacha, whose sudden death occurred on the 8th of June<BR>
1998. Since my husband died, I have been thrown into a state of =
utter<BR>
confusion, frustration and hopelessness by the present civilian<BR>
administration.<BR>
<BR>
The security agents in the country have subjected me to physical and<BR>
psychological torture. My son (Mohammed Abacha) is still under detention =
arraigned before the federal high court of Nigeria for an offence he did =
not commit. As a widow that has been traumatized, I am hopeless with my =
present faith. You must have heard over the media reports on the =
recovery of various sums of money deposited by&nbsp; my late husband =
with various security firms. Some companies willingly gave up their =
secret and disclosed our money confidently lodged there, or many, =
outright blackmail.<BR>
<BR>
Infact the total sum discovered by the government so far is in the =
tune<BR>
of $700 to $600 Million USD and they are not relenting to make me =
poor<BR>
for life. I came in contact with your name and address through my<BR>
personal research and would want to have faith and confidence in you as =
I view you to be of responsible personality. I have no doubt about your =
capacity and goodwill to assist me in receiving into your custody (for =
safety) the sum of $70.3 Million USD willed and deposited safely in my =
favour by my late husband. This money is currently kept in Safe Deposit =
Box (SDB) at a security firm within Europe.<BR>
<BR>
As it is legally required, the administration of my late husband's<BR>
property is under the authority of the family's Lawyer(Attorney).The<BR>
investigative teams set up by my government have submitted their report =
after freezing almost all our account.Fortunately, our family lawyer had =
secretly protected the personal will of my husband from the notice of =
the investigators and have strictly advised that the$40.3m USD be =
urgently moved to an overseas account of any trust worthy but ANNONYMOUS =
foreign family friend without delay, for security reasons.All our =
traveling papers have been seized by the government thereby preventing =
us from traveling and all the local and international outfit of our =
business empire seized.This sum of money is our only hope to stay =
alive.<BR>
<BR>
I have therefore agreed to compensate your good self with 30% of the<BR>
total deposit only when you recieve the deposit box from the security =
firm and its contents safely lodged in your account. They have equally =
guaranteed 100% risk-free and smooth transfer. If you are interested in =
assisting me, please reach me immediately and send to me your =
confidential telephone and fax number(s) so that I or my son mustapha =
can reach you as soon as possible.<BR>
<BR>
For obvious security reasons, it is imperative that you&nbsp; keep all =
our communication very secret. Do not mention my family`s name or =
disclose the transaction to anybody. If you are not interested in =
assisting me, please still get in touch so that I can make alternative =
arrangement as&nbsp; time is of the essence.Please do not expose me to =
my government.<BR>

family's predicament. Please reply to:<BR>
