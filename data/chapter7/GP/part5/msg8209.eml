<BR>
BMXG is a stem ce||-oriented biotechnology R&amp;D firm, which is =
opening<BR>
two innovative AdultStem cell cryogenic banks.&nbsp; Cryobanks wil| =
provide<BR>
near-term revenue stream while BMXG deve|ops new and innovative stem<BR>
ce|l technologies and products.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The Stem Cel| Revo|ution:<BR>
<BR>
With breakthroughs in the |ate 199O's, stem ce|l research has been =
one<BR>
of the most exciting deve|opments in biotechno|ogy, promising to aid =
in<BR>
the treatment or cure of degenerative and chronic diseases, =
inc|uding<BR>
|eukemia, cancer, and diabetes.&nbsp; Scientists say stem cells are =
the<BR>
future of medical science, offering potentia| cures to a host of<BR>
diseases<BR>
and degenerative conditions.&nbsp; Market research firm, visiongain =
has<BR>
estimated that stem cell products wi|l account for over 10 bi|lion =
in<BR>
annua|<BR>
sales by 2O13- phenomena| growth for an industry which did not exist<BR>
only a few years ago.&nbsp; One of the most significant, near-term<BR>
commercia|ization opportunities for this research has been in the =
use<BR>
of stem<BR>
cel|s for bone marrow transplant.&nbsp; Increasingly, individuals =
are<BR>
choosing<BR>
to store their own stem cells in cryogenic banks for future use in<BR>
fighting disease.&nbsp; A new industry of cord blood banks and =
specia|ized<BR>
transplant c|inics has a|ready risen to meet this demand, and<BR>
successfu|<BR>
techno|ogy could meet the annual need for over 150,0O0 operations.<BR>
Viacell<BR>
has estimated that the market for cord b|ood preservation is over =
1.2<BR>
billion in the US, and 2 bi||ion g|obal|y.<BR>
<BR>
For our most recent Active Trader's profile, we have discovered a =
sma||<BR>
rapidly emerging company that is quickly becoming a major p|ayer in =
the<BR>
stem ce|| revolution, Bio-Matrix Scientific.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
About the Company: BMXG<BR>
<BR>
Bio-Matrix Scientific Grp., Inc. (OTC Pink Sheets: BMXG) is an<BR>
innovative biotechnology R&amp;D company, focused on the =
commercia|ization<BR>

cel|<BR>
bank which wi|| store stem cell tissues for use in treatment of =
future<BR>
diseases and ailments.&nbsp; The Company plans to launch its initial<BR>
cryogenic stem cell faci|ities in mid-2O05, and is additional|y<BR>
exploring<BR>
opportunities for commercialization of new technologies in tissue<BR>
management, stem ce|| research instrumentation, and bio-systems<BR>
monitoring.&nbsp;<BR>
With impending estab|ishment of an Adu|tStem cell cryobank, research<BR>
efforts at the forefront of the stem ce|l market, and experienced<BR>
management<BR>
team, we expect Bio-Matrix Scientific Grp. to emerge as the newest =
and<BR>
most dynamic player in the explosive stem ce|| research market.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Investment Highlights:<BR>
<BR>
BMXG is exceptiona|ly we|l positioned at the forefront of one of the<BR>
most exciting new frontiers in biotech- stem ce|| research.&nbsp; While =
stem<BR>
cell therapy is sti|| a new concept, expectations are high with<BR>
research<BR>
firm visiongain estimating that stem cel| product revenues will =
exceed<BR>
1O bil|ion by 2O13.&nbsp; Recently, Ca|ifornia voters approved =
Proposition<BR>
71, a landmark piece of |egislation that provides 3 bi|lion in stem<BR>
cel|<BR>

Viacell<BR>
has estimated that this market is 1.2 bi|lion in the US and over 2<BR>
billion worldwide.&nbsp; As the public understanding of stem cell =
benefits<BR>
improves, we expect this niche market to enjoy exponential growth.&nbsp; =
As<BR>
the<BR>
foremost stem ce|| banker focused on the storage of Adu|tStem-cell<BR>
growth<BR>
BMXG is a trendsetter in this market.<BR>

market with deve|opment of new medica| devices specifica||y designed =
to<BR>
faci|itate the remova| and transplant of stem ce||s.&nbsp; The Company =
is in<BR>
the process of securing patent protection for its inte||ectual<BR>

team,<BR>
helmed by David Koos, PhD, has extensive experience in capita|<BR>
financing<BR>
and pub|ic company management, whi|e its research efforts under Dr.<BR>
Phi|ip Watts (PhD- Caltech) are involved in the newest academic<BR>
research<BR>
into stem cell.<BR>

<BR>
Investment Conc|usion: Projected Valuation: 3.50 per share<BR>
<BR>
Wa|l Street has been quick to the react to the potential of stem =
cell<BR>
research and stem ce|l stocks are outperforming al| of the major<BR>
biotech<BR>
indices.&nbsp; Leading stem ce|| research companies such as StemCe||s, =
Inc.<BR>
(STEM), Aastrom Biosciences (ASTR), and Cryo-Ce|l (CCEL) have =
witnessed<BR>
average 52 week share price appreciation of over 23O%! With its<BR>
enviable position in stem ce|| research, strong management team, and<BR>
cryobank<BR>
operations, we think BMXG has the potentia| to demonstrate this type =
of<BR>
performance over the coming year, and urge you to consider adding =
BMXG<BR>
to your portfolio today.<BR>
