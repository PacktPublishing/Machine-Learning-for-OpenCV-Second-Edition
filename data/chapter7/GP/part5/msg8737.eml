<br>On Monday mornings I am dedicated to the proposition that all men =
are created jerks.<br><br>The first sign of corruption in a society that =
is still alive is that the end justifies the means.



<br><br>Hope, the patent medicine for disease, disaster, sin.


<BR>Honor is like an island, rugged and without a beach once we have =
left it, we can never return.<BR>Your labor only may be sold, your soul =
must not.

<br>I would rather earn 1 off a 100 people's efforts than 100 of my own =
efforts.
The value of an idea has nothing whatever to do with the sincerity of =
the man who expresses it.


<BR><BR>Great leaders understand human behavior rather than the =
cybernetics of any function.



<br><br>Nothing is more repugnant to me than brotherly feelings grounded =
in the common baseness people see in one another.

Like swimming, riding, writing, or playing golf, happiness can be =
learned.



<BR>Don't smother each other. No one can grow in the shade.<br>The great =
business of life is to be, to do, to do without and to depart.

<BR>Men, their rights and nothing more women, their rights and nothing =
less.<BR><BR>For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain =
we can carry nothing out. [1 Timothy 6:7]<BR>Happiness seems made to be =
shared.<br><br>The acquiring of culture is the development of an avid =
hunger for knowledge and beauty.



<br>The human race afraid of nothing, rushes on through every crime.



<BR><BR>The only way you can bring in the harvest in the fall is to =
plant in the spring, and to water, weed, fertilize in the summer
