MISSOULA, MT, Jun 25, 2004 /PRNewswire-FirstCall via COMTEX/ -- Golden =
Opportunity Resources, Inc., (OTC Pink: GDNO) a Nevada Corporation.<BR>
<BR>
The company is pleased to announce that it has entered into an agreement =
whereby the company can earn a 25% working interest in a previously =
drilled oil and gas well in Bossier Parish, Louisiana. The farming =
agreement calls for Golden Opportunity to spend $250,000USD on the =
re-completion and hook-up for the Rinsland Well to a gas pipeline. Any =
remaining unused funds from the re-completion will be used for the =
drilling of an additional well.<BR>
<BR>
The Rinsland Well is a multi-zone oil and gas well with multiple re- =
completion opportunities. The well currently has 2,000 lbs. of pressure =
on a wellhead surface gauge. This pressure is coming from previously =
perforated zones from 9,000-9,700 feet. Work is expected to begin on the =
re-completion next month.<BR>
<BR>
The company will keep its shareholders updated as this re-completion =
effort and will make further news releases as new information comes =
available.<BR>
