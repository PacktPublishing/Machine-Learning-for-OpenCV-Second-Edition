<br><br>Art -- the one achievement of Man which has made the long trip =
up from all fours seem well advised.


<BR>You cannot shake hands with a clenched fist.

<br>A school without football is in danger of deteriorating into a =
medieval study hall.


<BR>There is no fear in love but perfect love casts out fear.



<br><br>In the adversity of our best friends we often find something =
that does not displease us.

<BR><BR>The essence of life is finding something you really love and =
then making the daily experience worthwhile.<BR>To innovate is not to =
reform.

<BR><BR>The more unpredictable the world is the more we rely on =
predictions.
<br>No man likes to live under the eye of perpetual =
disapprobation.<BR>The fool is always beginning to live.


Geniuses themselves don't talk about the gift of genius, they just talk =
about hard work and long hours.



<BR><BR>Fear is proof of a degenerate mind.



Marriage is an adventure, like going to war.



<br>I never worry about action, but only inaction.<br>A friend may well =
be reckoned the masterpiece of nature.
<br><br>Gaiety --a quality of ordinary men. Genius always presupposes =
some disorder in the machine.

<br><br>A diplomat is a person who can tell you to go to hell in such a =
way that you actually look forward to the trip.<br><br>Smith and Wesson =
or a Colt always beat four aces.
