<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;From The Desk of Mr.Mustafa Salah Eldeen.<BR>
Manager National Bank of Abu Dhabi<BR>
Dubai Unted Arab Emirate (U.A.E.)<BR>
Email:mustafasalaheldee@hotmail.com<BR>
<BR>
I am Mr.Mustafa Salah Eldeen Branch Manager National Bank of Abu Dhabi), =
I<BR>
have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.A =
British<BR>
Oil consultant and contractor with the Kruger Gold Company,Mr.Remond =
Beck<BR>
made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, =
valued<BR>
at US$12,000,000.00 (Twelve Million United State Dollars) in my =
branch.<BR>
Upon maturity,<BR>
<BR>
I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no =
reply.<BR>
After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his<BR>
contract employers, the Kruger Gold Company that Mr. Raymond Beck =
died<BR>
in a plane crash along with his wife Mr. and Mrs. Remond Beck died =
in<BR>
a plan crash along with his wife in Egypt Air Flight 990, 1999 air =
crash.<BR>
<BR>
Since we got this information about his death and on further =
investigation,<BR>
I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to<BR>
trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further =
investigation<BR>
and discovered that Mr. Remond Beck did not declare any kin or =
relations<BR>
in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork =
in<BR>
my Bank.<BR>
<BR>
This sum of US$12,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the =
interest<BR>
is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. =
No<BR>
one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Laws of United =
Arab<BR>
Emirates, at the expiration of 7 (seven) years, the money will revert =
to<BR>
the ownership of the (U.A.E) Government if nobody applies to claim the =
fund.<BR>
<BR>
Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to =
stand<BR>
in as the next of kin to Mr. Remond Beck so that the fruits of this =
old<BR>
man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government =
officials.<BR>
<BR>
This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names =
and<BR>
address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents =
and<BR>
affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin.<BR>
<BR>
We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and =
notarization<BR>
of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of =
probate/<BR>
administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any =
part<BR>
of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer =
of<BR>
this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin.<BR>
<BR>
The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio =
of<BR>
60% for me and 40% for you. There is no risk at all as all the =
paperwork<BR>
for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as =
the<BR>
Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this =
transaction.<BR>
If you are interested, please reply immediately via the private =
email<BR>
address above.<BR>
<BR>
Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and =
relevant<BR>
documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please send me =
your<BR>
confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication. Please =
observe<BR>
utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be =
most<BR>
profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to =
invest<BR>
my share in your country.<BR>
<BR>
Awaiting your urgent reply via my confidential email address.<BR>
