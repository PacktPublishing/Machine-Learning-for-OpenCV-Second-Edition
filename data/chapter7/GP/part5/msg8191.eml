is committed to maintaining a safe environment for its community of <br>
buyers and sellers. To protect the security of your account, PayPal =
employs <br>
some of the most advanced security systems in the world and our =
anti-fraud <br>
teams regularly screen the PayPal system for unusual activity. <br>
<br>
Recently, our Account Review Team identified some unusual activity in =
your <br>
account. In accordance with PayPal's User Agreement and to ensure that =
your <br>
account has not been compromised, access to your account was limited. =
Your <br>
account access will remain limited until this issue has been resolved. =
This <br>
is a fraud prevention measure meant to ensure that your account is not =
<br>
compromised. <br>
<br>
In order to secure your account and quickly restore full access, we may =
<br>
require some specific information from you for the following reason: =
<br>
<br>
We would like to ensure that your account was not accessed by an <br>
unauthorized third party. Because protecting the security of your =
account <br>
is our primary concern, we have limited access to sensitive PayPal =
account <br>
features. We understand that this may be an inconvenience but please =
<br>
understand that this temporary limitation is for your protection. <br>
<br>
Case ID Number: PP-040-187-541 <br>
<br>
We encourage you to log in and restore full access as soon as possible. =
<br>
Should access to your account remain limited for an extended period of =
<br>
time, it may result in further limitations on the use of your =
account.</font></tt><FONT face=3DVerdana =
