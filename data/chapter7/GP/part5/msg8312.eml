ability to handle a financial business transaction of such =
magnitude.<BR>

partnership in accommodating for me. You will be rewarded with 10% of =
the total sum for your partnership. Can you be my partner on this?<BR>

the richest man in Russia and owner of the following companies:<BR>

with its branches all over the world)<BR>
<BR>
SOURCE OF FUNDS:<BR>
The documents of the above funds in question was handed over to me to be =
used in payment of an American oil merchant for his last oil deal with =
my boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Already the funds have been deposited with =
HBOS TRESURY SERVICES NETHERLANDS ,where the final crediting is expected =
to be carried out. While I was on the process, My Boss got arrested for =
his involvement on politics in financing the leading and opposing =
political parties (the Union of Right Forces, led by Boris Nemtsov, and =
Yabloko, a liberal/social democratic party led by Gregor Yavlinsky) =
which poses treat to President Vladimir Putin second tenure as Russian =

All I need from you is to stand as the beneficiary of the above quoted =
sum and I will arrange for the documentations which will enable HBOS =
TRESURY SERVICES PLC transfer the funds to you in an account that you =
will open in Deutsche Bank Netherlands. I have decided to use this sum =
to relocate to the American continent and never to be connected to any =
of Mikhail Khodorkovsky conglomerates. The transaction has to be =
concluded in 3 weeks before Mikhail Khodorkovsky is out on bail. Please =
note that this transaction is risk free and I require all aspect of this =
project to be based on truthfulness and transparency.<BR>

details.<BR>
