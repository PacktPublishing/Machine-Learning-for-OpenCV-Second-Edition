<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Dear partner<BR>
<BR>
This letter may come to you as a surprise due to the fact that we have =
not met personally. My name is Lars Jerry, a business merchant in =
Indonesia. I was a victim of the TSUNAMI disaster that led over 174,000 =
people dead in Indonesia's Aceh province.<BR>
<BR>
Well, I lost all my family members and was seriously injured as a result =
of this catastrophe and currently hospitalised in Dubai, U.A.E. My =
illness has defiled all form of medical treatment and I only have about =
a few months to live according to medical report. I have not =
particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone =
not even myself but my business. But now I regret all these as I now =
know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all =
the money in this world. Now that I know my time is near, I want to will =
and give most of my properties and assets to you to enhance the relief =
of other Asian Tsunami Victims and other charity aid. I have decided to =
give alms for charity aid, as I want this to be one of the last good =
deeds I do on earth. But i am afraid most of these charity organisations =
will use it for their personal interests without someone to co-ordinate =
this task.<BR>
<BR>
Hence, i am seeking a trust-worthy person who is able to help me carry =
out this great task. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I =
cannot do this my self any more. I lost alot of money, assests, =
properties, etc due to this disaster. Meanwhile, i still have =
$9,500,000.00 USD (Nine million five hundred U. S. dollars only) cash =
deposit that I have with a Financial Firm Abroad. I will want you to =
help me collect this deposit and dispatched it for humanitarian aid. =
Also, you will let them know that it is I Lars Jerry that is making this =
generous donations to them to serve as memorial while I was on earth. I =
am writing this from my laptop computer in my hospital bed where I wait =
for my time to come. I pray that God uses you to support and assist me =
with good heart.<BR>
<BR>
Also, these are the necessary criteria you have to meet before I will =
give you the full authority over the fund:<BR>
<BR>
(a). My conviction of your transparent, honesty and diligence and you =
will treat this transaction as I have instructed you to do.<BR>
<BR>
(b). Upon the receipt of the funds, you will promptly release =
$3,000,000.00 USD to charity aid to help the needy, $5,000,000 USD will =
be used for investment and you will ONLY take the balance $1,500,000.00 =
USD for your noble assistance.<BR>
<BR>
(c). You must be ready to produce me with enough information about =
yourself to put my mind at rest, by providing your full beneficiary =
name, your contact address, telephone and fax numbers for further =
communication.<BR>
<BR>
(d) All necessary legal documentations must be undertaken before you can =
have the full right over this fund and other properties which i will =
give to you in due course.<BR>
<BR>
(e) Also, you will be entitle to 20% of the annual income of any =
investment you wish to go into in rder to enhance further charitable =
work. I would suggest that you can invest this money into stocks, =
properties, bonds, etc. or any lucrative business you may suggest.<BR>
<BR>
I will bring you into the complete picture of the transaction when I =
have heard from you. Your urgent response will be highly appreciated =
with all your contact details.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks for your anticipated cooperation and Gob bless you.<BR>
<BR>
Yours faithfully,<BR>
<BR>
Lars Jerry.<BR>
