Calvary Greetings!!<BR>
<BR>
My name is Mrs. Ruth Makary a 65yrs old lady. I am a cancer patient and =
a<BR>
nationality of Kuwait. I am married to Mr. Sammy Makary who worked =
with<BR>
Kuwait embassy in SWITZERLAND for nine years before he died in an =
automobile<BR>
crash in December 1999. We were married for eleven years without a =
child.<BR>
Before his death we were devoted Christians. When my late husband was =
alive<BR>
we protected our assets of $USD5 Million through the purchase of a =
life<BR>
insurance policy (Swiss variable annuities) from a Swiss life =
insurance<BR>
company. I was irrevocably designates as beneficiaries of the policy. =
The<BR>
purpose of this investment was to safe our principal capital and make =
use of<BR>
accrues income from the annuities for our upkeep since the principal =
fund<BR>
and the accrued interest are exempt from Swiss taxes under Swiss law. =
But<BR>
unfortunately he dies.<BR>
<BR>
Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last long due to my =
cancer<BR>
problem. Though what disturbs me most is my stroke. I developed this<BR>
sickness as a result of the sudden shock and hearth attack I had when =
the<BR>
breaking news came to me on that faithful day that my husband was =
involved<BR>
in an auto crash and died at the spot in the city of Zurich in =
December<BR>
1999.<BR>
<BR>
Having known my condition I decided to liquidate these assets and =
donate<BR>
this fund with all the accrued interests to church or better still a<BR>
Christian individual that will utilize this money the way I am going =
to<BR>
instruct here in. I want an individual that will use this fund to =
churches,<BR>
Orphanages, Research centers and widows, propagating the word of God and =
to<BR>
ensure that the house of God is maintained.<BR>
<BR>
I took this bold decision because I don&#146;t have any child that will =
inherit<BR>
this money and my husband&#146;s relatives are of questionable =
characters and are<BR>
not Christians. And I don&#146;t want my hard earned money to be misused =
by<BR>
unbelievers and I would dislike a situation where this money will be =
used in<BR>
an ungodly manner. Hence the reasons for taking this bold decision.<BR>
<BR>
I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going and everyone =
is<BR>
entitling to death. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the =
Lord.<BR>
Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold =
my<BR>
peace. I will be glad to speak with you if I had the privileged to do =
so.<BR>
With God all things are possible.<BR>
<BR>
I have briefed our attorney about this development. As soon as I =
receive<BR>
your reply indicating your interest to help me, I shall provide you with =
the<BR>
contacts of our lawyer in Edinburgh, UK whom shall help you to process =
the<BR>
freezing of the life policy and have the fund transferred to you. To =
process<BR>
the liquidation of this asset would incur some expenses. Please I urge =
you<BR>
to take care of this as your contribution towards bringing this vision =
to a<BR>
reality for the doing of God own thing. God loves a cheerful giver and =
I<BR>
pray that he gives you the wisdom to handle this project.<BR>
<BR>
I want you and the church to always pray for me. My happiness is that =
I<BR>
lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to serve the =
Lord<BR>
must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful all =
through<BR>
your life. Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for =
other<BR>
people for this same purpose.<BR>
<BR>
Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated here, and if =
in<BR>
anyway you would not be interested, please discard this email and =
always<BR>
remember me in your prayers. Expecting to hearing from you.<BR>
<BR>
Remain blessed in the name of the Lord.<BR>
<BR>
Yours in Christ,<BR>
<BR>
Mrs. Ruth Makary.<BR>
