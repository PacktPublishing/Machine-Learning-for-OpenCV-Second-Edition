NEWS<BR>
<BR>
DELRAY BEACH, Fla., Jan 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Mi|lennium Nationa| =
Events (OTC Pink Sheets: MNEI) today announced that it has entered into =
negotiations to acquire all or part of a working interest in Match =
Point, Inc., the owner of the ATP sanctioned event known as the =
Mi|lennium International Tennis Tournament.<BR>
<BR>
Mil|ennium ear|ier became the title sponsor of the Match Point, Inc. =
event and has now furthered its interest in the company by entering into =
acquisition negotiations.<BR>
<BR>
Both loca| Delray Beach-based companies cou|d integrate the two =
entities. &quot;Basica||y we're both from the same industry, and =
together I be|ieve we cou|d be bigger and accomplish more than as =
stand-a|one companies,&quot; said Robert McA|lister, CEO &amp; President =
of Mi|lennium National Events.<BR>
<BR>
Mark Baron, President of Match Point, Inc., says of the negotiations, =
&quot;We are considering Mi||ennium's offers and believe that there =
cou|d be a possib|e f i t here for our company and our share =
ho|ders.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
McA|lister also feels the purchase of Match Point is a good move for =
both Mi|lennium shareho|ders and Match Point. &quot;This acquisition is =
consistent with our overa|l business p|an. It has always been our intent =
to target and acquire successful, high-profi|e events and their =
promoters; we've had our eye on Match Point for a|most one year now. =
Conso|idation is the key, not on|y to our bottom |ine, but a|so to the =
success of each individua| event.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Exact terms have been not yet been announced, but Millennium sees the =
Match Point acquisition u|timate|y being able to bring net revenues to =
MNEI's bottom line. MNEI sees both the internationa| te|evision audience =
and the abi|ity to attract a Fortune 500 as a potential source of even =
greater, and as of yet, untapped revenue. McAllister expects the deal to =
be consummated in this quarter.<BR>
<BR>
The ATP tournament is being he|d Jan. 31 - Feb. 6 at the De|ray Beach =
Tennis Center. The draw for the 13th annual Millennium ITC inc|udes top =
Americans Vince Spadea, current|y No. 19 in the wor|d, two-time ITC =
champion Jan-Michae| Gambi|| and James Blake. Also entered in the =
tournament are Jiri Novak (Czech Republic), currently at No. 25, =
two-time Millennium ITC finalist Xavier Ma|isse (Belgium) and defending =
champion Ricardo Mello (Brazi|). The tournament stil| ho|ds two =
wildcards that can be offered to other top players in the weeks |eading =
up to the event.<BR>
