<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Dear friend,<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;My name is David Richard, I worked in a bank here in the<BR>
&nbsp;United Kingdom.I am contacting you of a business transaction,<BR>
&nbsp;of a huge sum of money from A deceased client of mine. Though =
I<BR>
&nbsp;know that a transaction of this magnitude Will make any one<BR>
&nbsp;apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that =
everything<BR>
&nbsp;has been taken care off,and all will be well at the end<BR>
&nbsp;Of the day. I decided to contact you due to the urgency<BR>
&nbsp;of this transaction.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;FACT:<BR>
&nbsp;I was the account officer of a foreigner named Gerald<BR>
&nbsp;Welsh who died in an air crash along with his wife on<BR>
&nbsp;The 31st October 1999 in an Egyptian airline 990 with<BR>
&nbsp;Other passengers on board. You can confirm this from<BR>
&nbsp;The website below which was published by CNN.WEBSITE.<BR>
&nbsp;<A =
HREF=3D"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/world/americas/502503.stm">http://news.bb=
c.co.uk/1/world/americas/502503.stm</A><BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;since his death, none of his next-of-kin are alive to<BR>
&nbsp;Make claims for this monies as his heir, because they<BR>
&nbsp;all died in the same accident himself and his wife<BR>
&nbsp;(May Their soul rest in peace). We could not release the<BR>
&nbsp;funds from his account unless someone applied for claim as<BR>
&nbsp;The next-of-kin to the deceased .At that period he had<BR>
&nbsp;$14,210,045m(fourteen million two hundred and ten thousand =
dollars)<BR>
&nbsp;in his account.After four to five years the money was<BR>
&nbsp;called back to the bank treasury as unclaimed bills and the =
money<BR>
&nbsp;shared amongst the directors of the bank,which has already =
been<BR>
&nbsp;done by the directors early this year.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;PROPOSITION;<BR>
&nbsp;Due to the relationship between i and the deceased(Gerald =
Welsh)he<BR>
&nbsp;told me of a diamond business which he had to do and left me<BR>
&nbsp;incare of the&quot;CERTIFICATE OF DEPOSIT&quot;which he used to =
lodge<BR>
&nbsp;the funds in a security company in europe which is to the tune =
of<BR>
&nbsp;$8.4m(eight million four hundred thousand dollars).<BR>
&nbsp;Note:that I decided to seek for whom his/her name shall be<BR>
&nbsp;used as the \next of kin/beneficiary to claim the funds at the<BR>
&nbsp;security company rather than allow The funds to lay unclaimed.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;It may interest you to know that i have secured from<BR>
&nbsp;the probate an order of mandamus to locate an<BR>
and no one was found. Please<BR>
&nbsp;acknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance of our<BR>
&nbsp;mutual business Endeavor by furnishing me with the following<BR>
&nbsp;information if you are interested.<BR>

&nbsp;Document in your name.<BR>
&nbsp;2. Direct Telephone and fax numbers For our<BR>
&nbsp;personal Contact and mutual trust in each other.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;I shall be compensating you with 20% percent of the<BR>
&nbsp;Whole funds on final conclusion of this project for<BR>
&nbsp;your assistance,while the balance shall be for me for<BR>
&nbsp;investment Purposes. Because I just retired.If this<BR>
&nbsp;proposal is Acceptable by you, please endeavor<BR>
