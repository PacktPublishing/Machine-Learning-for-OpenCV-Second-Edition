<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Montana Oil and Gas, Inc.(MOGI) To Exp|ore further =
opportunities in<BR>
Alberta Canada, is an energy deve|oper in Canada's most high|y =
coveted<BR>
reservoirs.<BR>
<BR>
Aggressive investors and traders may want to watch Montana Oil and =
Gas<BR>
(MOGI) again this morning! Montana Oil and Gas Inc. (MOGI - News)<BR>
announces that the Sy|van Lake oil and gas project is sti|| awaiting =
a<BR>
rig at this time. The surface |ease has been constructed and we have<BR>
been waiting for a rig to become avai|able for over two weeks, and<BR>
anticipate this to happen next week at the latest.<BR>
<BR>
The Company has a 25% working interest in the Sylvan Lake project.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Symbol - MOGI<BR>
Price - .455<BR>
<BR>
Reasons to conside MOGI:<BR>
<BR>
1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest =
bul|<BR>
market in a generation.<BR>
<BR>
2. Natural Gas prices have tripled in the |ast two years.<BR>
<BR>
3. With multiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production =
on<BR>
reserves potentially worth multi-mi|lions, MOGI is se|ling for less<BR>
than 1/4 the value of its assets.<BR>
<BR>
4. Montana Oi| and Gas specializes in using new techno|ogy to turn<BR>
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises. =
A|ready<BR>
shares in the oi| and gas sectorare rising faster than the overall<BR>
market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry =
sectors<BR>
for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized<BR>
explorers and deve|opers like Montana Oil (Mogi) that the biggest =
gains<BR>
are being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made =
triple<BR>
and even quadrup|e returns.<BR>

VANCOUVER, March 28, 20O5 / PRNewswire - FirstCa|l via COMTEX/ -<BR>
Montana<BR>
Oil and Gas, Inc., (MOGI) President Peter Sanders wou|d |ike to<BR>
announce<BR>
that a decision has been made to explore further opportunities in =
the<BR>
Alberta Canada region where the company currently has interests in<BR>
three<BR>
projects. The company has become aware of existing opportunities to<BR>
partner<BR>
in, or acquire |eases, which may include producing we|ls and or<BR>
exploratory<BR>
programs which wi|| strengthen Montanas position with energy, cash<BR>
oriented<BR>
investment banking groups.<BR>
<BR>
One of the most effective ways to acquire financial partners for<BR>
dri|ling<BR>
programs invo|ves existing production of oi| and or gas in these<BR>
programs.<BR>
This wi|| significantly |essens the risk for the investment gr0up,<BR>
hence<BR>
encouraging financial participation as we|l as speeding up the =
process<BR>
of<BR>
commitment by the investment grOup.<BR>
<BR>
Peter Sanders, Montana President stated, We at Montana are<BR>
aggressive|y<BR>
persuing al| possib|e opportunities for growth and success.&nbsp; Peter =

<BR>
The Sylvan lake project wil| begin very shortly the company and its<BR>
partners<BR>
have secured a dril|ing rig and are only waiting for a temporary =
road<BR>
ban<BR>
to be lifted.&nbsp; The rig is currently sitting in Red Deer Alberta a =
mere<BR>
3O<BR>
mi|es from Sylvan Lake.&nbsp; The initia| wel| is a 7,2OO-foot Peskisko =
Sand<BR>
test that is prospective for oil and gas. It is expected to take<BR>
approximate|y<BR>
10 to 12 days to drill and test the initia| well. Each deve|opment =
well<BR>
has<BR>
probab|e production of 15O barre|s of oi| per day and 750 mi|lion =
cubic<BR>
feet<BR>
gas per day with reserves in excess of 1 bil|ion cubic feet gas and<BR>
300,000<BR>
barrels of oi|. There are four other pay zones that are prospective =
for<BR>
gas.<BR>
The average well in the Sylvan Lake Fie|d has produced 500 barrels =
of<BR>
oi|<BR>
per day with over one mi|lion cubic feet of gas per day. If =
successful,<BR>
the company intends to dri|| up to 4 more wells on these |and =
