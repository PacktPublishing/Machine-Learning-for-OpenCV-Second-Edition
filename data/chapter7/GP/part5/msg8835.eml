<br><br>Left-wingers are incapable of conspiring because they are all =
egomaniacs.

<br><br>A fool and his money are soon parted.

Character is a by-product it is produced in the great manufacture of =
daily duty.



<br>I am my brother's keeper, and he's sleeping pretty rough these =
days.<BR>Ideals are the worlds masters.


<br><br>One man with courage makes a majority.

<br>We hate the kindness which we understand.



<br>Laws teach us to know when we commit injury and when we suffer =
it.Decisiveness is a characteristic of high-performing men and women. =
Almost any decision is better than no decision at all.


Childhood is the sleep of reason.


<br><br>People who are brutally honest get more satisfaction out of the =
brutality than out of the honesty.<BR>Drink! for you know not whence you =
came nor why: drink! for you know not why you go, nor where.The human =
body is the best picture of the human soul.



<BR><BR>The people of the world having once been deceived, suspect =
deceit in truth itself.<br><br>Never trust the artist. Trust the tale. =
The proper function of a critic is to save the tale from the artist who =
created it.Men must endure, their going hence even as their coming =
hither. Ripeness is all.



<br>A Constitution should be short and obscure.A hundred men may make an =
encampment, but it takes a woman to make a home.
