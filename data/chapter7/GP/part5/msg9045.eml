Coastal Holdings, Inc. in Negotiations to Acquire Interest in BioMedicom =
Inc.<BR>

HOUSTON , Jun 25, 2004 (PRIMEZONE via COMTEX) -- Coastal Holdings, Inc. =
(Pink Sheets:CSJJ) is pleased to announce that it is in negotiations to =
acquire a 35%-45% equity interest in BioMedicom Inc. (BIOMED). BIOMED =
will be an exhibitor at the International Congress of Radiology to be =
held June 27-29, 2004 at the Palais des Congres de Montreal. CSJJ CEO =
Andrea Cortellazzi will be in negotiations with BIOMED CEO Michael =
Berman prior to the start of the Congress in Montreal. CSJJ will =
announce the outcome of this meeting at a future date. The investment in =
BIOMED will be for a total of $2M with an initial deposit of $300,000 =
upon contract signing. As part of the investment, CSJJ would receive =
distribution rights in North America to SONOReal, a revolutionary add-on =
to any ultrasound system. This product makes 3D ultrasound imaging easy =
to learn, use and afford. It increases the productive life of an =
existing ultrasound system, enabling 3D visualization in real-time, =
while maintaining familiar protocols. SONOReal has received several =
regulatory clearances, notably from the ISO and the FDA.<BR>
