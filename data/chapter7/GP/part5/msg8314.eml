<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; URGENT BUSINESS =
ASSISTANT<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;With due respect, I write you this proposal, which I<BR>
believe would be of great interest to you, I found your<BR>
contact while I was doing a private research through<BR>
chamber of commerce for a reliable and capable foreign<BR>
partner that will assist my family and I. I am Mrs Janet<BR>
Scott, the wife of late Dannis Scott of Zimbabwe.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
During the current war against farmers in Zimbabwe<BR>
and from support of our President Robert Mugabe to<BR>
claim all the white owned farms in our country, all the<BR>
white farmers were ordered to surrender their<BR>
farms to his party members and his followers. My husband<BR>
who was one of the best farmers in our country and<BR>
treasure of the farmers cooperation did not support<BR>
his idea and so the party members invaded my husband's<BR>
farm and burnt everything in the farm, killed my<BR>
husband,my first son who would have graduated this<BR>
year as a medical doctor and made away with a lot<BR>
of items in my husband's farm.<BR>
<BR>
After the death of my husband during the month of<BR>
February 10th 2002 presidential election in zimbabwe,<BR>
I and my family decided to move out of Zimbabwe<BR>
because of our lives were in danger . The amount<BR>
my husband had deposited in a private security<BR>
company here in south africa before he was killed was<BR>
US$15M (Fifteen Million United States Dollars) This money<BR>
was mearnt for the purchase of agricultural equipments.<BR>
Owing to the turmoil being experienced by my family we<BR>
decided to move to the Republic of South Africa where my<BR>
husband had already given me instructions and details of<BR>
the fund he had deposited.<BR>
<BR>
This money was deposited as valuable items.Again<BR>
when we arrived South Africa we had became assylum<BR>
seekers (refugees),now we came to find out that our life<BR>
has suddenly been made difficult as the South African<BR>
Moneytary policy does not allow us as refugees<BR>
to operate bank accounts or make financail<BR>
investment.I cannot but contact you to be my foreign<BR>
partner to help me and my family in the transfer<BR>
of this fund out of South Africa as it is all we have<BR>
and hope on now.<BR>
<BR>
So if you consider this proposal I have agreed to give<BR>
you 20% of the total sum for helping me to transfer<BR>
this money out to your country and 5% will be mapped<BR>
out for expenses both of us incures during this<BR>
transaction while 75% will be for my family and I<BR>
to invest in your country.Contact me on telephone =
number:+27-72-720-7880<BR>
Email: jessicascott@webmail.co.za<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Note that this transaction is 100% risk-free and<BR>
absolutely confidential for security reasons.<BR>
<BR>
Best Regards,<BR>
