Does this boat go to Europe, France?<br>A woman is the only thing I am =
afraid of that I know will not hurt me.<br>Finally, be strong in the =
Lord, and in the strength of His might. [Ephesians 6:10]
<br><br>As you walk through the valley of the unknown, you will find the =
footprints of Jesus both in front of you and beside you.



<br>The better I know men the more I admire dogs.


<BR>I do not like the man who squanders life for fame give me the man =
who living makes a name.



<br><br>He who denies all, confesses all.



<BR><BR>Fame is like a river, that beareth up things light and swollen, =
and drowns things weighty and solid.

<BR><BR>Whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn to him the other =
also. [Matthew 5:39]
<BR><BR>Finance is the art of passing currency from hand to hand until =
it finally disappears.<BR>Ambition never comes to an end.<br>Oh my son's =
my son till he gets him a wife, but my daughter's my daughter all her =
life.<BR>It's better to waste one's youth than to do nothing with it at =
all.



<br>Honor is the reward of virtue.


<BR><BR>It belongs to the imperfection of everything human that man can =
only attain his desire by passing through its opposite.



<br>If the laws could speak for themselves, they would complain of the =
lawyers.<BR><BR>Some evils are cured by contempt.<br>Love is much like a =
wild rose, beautiful and calm, but willing to draw blood in its defense.
