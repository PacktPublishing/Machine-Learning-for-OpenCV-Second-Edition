Marine Investment Growth Alert<BR>
Discovering the Most Profitable Investments in the Seas<BR>
******************************<BR>
<BR>
Virtually untapped and barely known to even the most seasoned investment =
professionals, this industry is quickly becoming the most vibrant and =
fastest growing segment of worldwide agriculture.<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
The answer is aquaculture, or fish farming, and it has quietly become =
the most dynamic segment of global agriculture, representing roughly 28% =
of all seafood production and producing annual revenues of $56 =
billion.<BR>
But why haven't I heard of it?<BR>
<BR>
While aquaculture is huge internationally, it has been slow to find =
acceptance in the US.&nbsp; But with increasing US consumption of =
seafood and overfishing of natural stocks, this is all rapidly =
changing!! Aquaculture is the fastest growing segment of the US =
agriculture industry and is expected to reach $5 Billion over the next =
several years!!<BR>
*****<BR>
How can I get involved?<BR>
*****<BR>
<BR>
We have discovered a small Florida-based company, trading for a little =
over a quarter per share, that is positioned to revolutionize the face =
of aquaculture forever.<BR>
<BR>
In the abandoned rock quarries of south Florida, this small company has =
spent more than five years developing eco-friendly aquaculture =
technologies that produce better quality seafood at lower cost and with =
faster production times.&nbsp; This company is already utilizing these =
technologies, and has become a major producer of striped bass and other =
popular seafood species.<BR>
<BR>
What is more, the company is diversifying its operations with =
independent wholesale, technology consulting, seafood processing, and =
value added products; the company is also expanding into Australia and =
the Pacific. With a fully vertically-integrated business model, this =
company is well on-track to become a leading US seafood =
conglomerate.<BR>
<BR>
*****<BR>
The Aquaculture Explosion<BR>
*****<BR>
<BR>
Since 1945, aquaculture has become an increasingly important component =
of global food production, representing the fastest growing segment of =
the worlds food economy with annual increases of more than 10% a =
year.<BR>
<BR>
With an increasing global population, seafood has supplanted many other =
forms of protein and sustenance as the primary source of caloric intake, =
with more than 1 billion people worldwide dependent on fish as their =
main source of animal protein.&nbsp; Worldwide fish consumption has =
risen from less than 40 million tons in 1970 to over 86 million tons in =
1998.&nbsp; As global consumption has skyrocketed, the ability of =
natural stocks to sustain this consumption has plummeted.<BR>
<BR>
Once considered an inexhaustible natural resource, the world=12s seafood =
is faced with alarming over-fishing and environmental =
considerations.&nbsp; Experts have predicted that by 2030, there will be =
a global 40 billion pounds per year seafood shortage.&nbsp; Already, in =
many places, heavy fishing and environmental problems have forced =
governments to limit or halt fishing until populations can recover.<BR>
<BR>
Many of the world=12s commercially important fish species are nearly =
gone, replaced by species of much lower market value.<BR>
<BR>
These factors pose a direct and critical threat to the $250 billion =
global seafood industry.&nbsp; Aquaculture represents the only clear and =
attainable near-term solution for this supply gap.&nbsp; Globally, =
aquaculture is a $56 billion industry, and represents roughly 28% of =
global seafood production- up from only 3.9% in 1970.&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
In spite of the tremendous and critical need for dramatic expansion of =
aquaculture production, the US has been slow to implement aquaculture =
production efforts.&nbsp; Total aquaculture production in the US =
represents only 1 billion pounds, or roughly 8% of total =
production.&nbsp; This $1 billion US industry is expected to reach $5 =
billion within the next several years, according to US government policy =
mandates.<BR>
<BR>
At the same time, Americans demand for seafood has reached unprecedented =
heights.&nbsp; As consumers recognizes the health benefits that a diet =
high in seafood with lean protein and heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids, =
per capita seafood consumption has increased by more than 50% since =
1960, and is expected to reach 5.4 million tons by 2020.<BR>
<BR>
The inability of wild-catch fish to meet increased demand has already =
created skyrocketing prices and limited availability of many =
species.&nbsp; The US is now the world=12s second largest importer of =
seafood behind Japan, and seafood imports are the second largest raw =
goods import, with $14 billion they are behind only oil in dollar =
value.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But there is some good news to this situation; the opportunity for =
savvvy traders to see their profits soar from early investment in the US =
aquaculture industry is better now than it ever has been in the =
past.&nbsp; We have found one company, in particular, that we think has =
the potential to make you rich:<BR>
<BR>
Neptune Industries is a small Florida-based vertically-integrated =
producer and distributor of seafood products that has been making big =
waves in the aquaculture industry.&nbsp; Neptune has spent more than =
five years developing and refining a series of innovative eco-friendly =
aquaculture technologies that will help make its product among the =
freshest and most flavorful on the market, while reducing production =
time and costs.<BR>
The SAFE=19 System-&nbsp; A Revolution in Aquaculture Technology<BR>
The core of Neptune's operations are its Solar-powered, Aquaculture, =
Finfish, Environment (S.A.F.E.) System- which is an innovative floating =
containment system, using solar power, solid waste removal, automated =
feeding systems, and advanced water circulation to create an ideal =
environemtnet fot the healthy and rapid growth of fish.&nbsp; Including =
the Company's patent pending Eco-Tank=19 jointed, articulating tank =
which absorbs the imact of wave, wind, and current actions, the SAFE=19 =
System is truly revolutionary within the industry, and will produce =
recurring revenue streams for the company from licensing sales.&nbsp; =
Neptune has recently signed a landmark joint venture agreement for =
licensing and implementation of this technology to aquaculture producers =
in the Asia-Pacific region.&nbsp; Neptune has recently filed a =
provisional patent application for the SAFE=19&nbsp; SYstem, which will =
provide full protection of this technology in the US and abroad for the =
next year, as the company files worldwide patent applications.<BR>
Pacific Expansion<BR>
Neptune just announced a joint venture agreement with South Pacific Aqua =
Technologies, Ltd. of The Cook Islands.&nbsp; South Pacific Aqua is a =
diversified fisheries company seeking to develop aquaculture operations =
in the Cook Islands, New Zealand, Australia, and Samoa.&nbsp; Headed by =
the former Secretary of Marine Resources for the Cook Islands, Neptune =
has secured the formal support and endorsement of the Cook Islands' =
government.<BR>
<BR>
Neptune could earn about $0.10 per share during 2005.&nbsp; Other public =
companies in the aquaculture sector trade at price to earnings multiples =
of 25x, or better.<BR>
Using only a P/E of 20x, shares of Neptune (NPNI) should be currently =
trading at $2.00 or more!!!<BR>
Neptune cannot keep up with the demand from its distributors and =
recently doubled its capacity to meet the demand.<BR>
Neptune expects to produce be up to 3 million lbs. of its striped bass =
product next year.<BR>
The Company is going to start selling its SAFE Systems this year, and is =
also aggressively pursuing acquisitions of US fish farms to build out =
its production capacity.&nbsp; We think that a $0.10 EP projection is =
extremely conservative!!<BR>
<BR>
The $250 billion seafood industry is expanding far beyond the capacity =
of natural stocks to meet demand.&nbsp; By 2030, there will be a global =
40 billion lbs. per year seafood shortage.<BR>
<BR>
Aquaculture has emerged as a clear solution.&nbsp; Well established =
worldwide, aquaculture is a $56 billion industry with production of 76 =
million tons, 28% of total production.<BR>
<BR>
As Americans turn to a healthy diet and consume more seafood, US =
aquaculture is expected to grow to $5 billion from its current market =
size of $1 billion.<BR>
<BR>
Neptune is becoming a fully vertically-integrated seafood production and =
distribution company with its introduction of value-added seafood =
products, wholesale seafood distribution, and license of its production =
technologies.<BR>
<BR>
The Company has developed the leading aquaculture technology on the =
market, its proprietary S.A.F.E.=19 System, which provides eco-friendly =
seafood production.&nbsp; NPNI has just received worldwide =
patent-pending status, and is filing additional patents for global =
markets.<BR>
<BR>
Neptune has recently signed a JV agreement with South Pacific Aqua =
Technologies to license this technology to aquaculture operations and =
fisheries in the South Pacific and Australia, and has received the =
support of the Cook Islands government for implementing this technology =
in the country.<BR>
<BR>
President &amp; CEO Ernie Papodoyianis is an experienced marine =
biologist and aquaculture executive with more than 20 years spent =
operating and managing aquaculture and fishery businesses.&nbsp; NPNI =
recently added Robert Hipple as CFO.&nbsp; Mr. Hipple is a former =
Professor of Tax and Securities Law at Georgetown University and has =
served in senior manageent positions for a number of large publicly =
traded companies.<BR>
<BR>
Based on current production estimates, we expect Neptune to reach annual =
production of more than 3.5 million pounds of seafood within the next =
twelve months- representing revenues of over $7.8 million- before =
acquisitions!!!<BR>
<BR>
Trading at just $0.26 per share, NPNI is extremely undervalued.&nbsp; =
Based on production estimates, NPNI...should carry a valuation of at =
least $2.00 per share- a gain of nearly 800%!!<BR>
