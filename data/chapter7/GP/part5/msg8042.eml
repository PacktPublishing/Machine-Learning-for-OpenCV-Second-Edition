<p> NEWS FLASH: Wall Street Breaking News discovers leading edge <br>
  Entertainment Company preparing for blockbuster new release! <br>
  KDSC positioned as the #1 investment in children's <br>
  entertainment for years to come. </p>
<p>Over the past decade, Disney and Warner Brothers have perfected <br>
  a proven formula in the entertainment industry that consistently <br>
  delivers over $100 Million per film release. Box office results <br>
  have shown that animated features and movies geared toward a <br>
  younger audience are genuine profit makers with movie-goers <br>
  starved for quality G-rated family entertainment.</p>
<p>By enhancing this model for success, KidSational, Inc. (KDSC) <br>
  is building a solid platform in the most profitable segment of <br>
  all mainstream movies - typically 5X more profitable than a big <br>
  production film. Through skillful management and product depth, <br>
  KDSC is rapidly becoming a diversified entertainment empire, <br>
  poised to become one of the leaders in this industry.</p>
<p>KDSC's initial motion picture is entitled &quot;The Guardians - =
Masters <br>
  of the Electro-World&quot;, based on adolescent super heroes along the =
<br>
  lines of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers and Teenage Mutant Ninja <br>
  Turtles, who have collectively produced revenues exceeding $500 <br>
  Million. One clear advantage for KDSC is that &quot;The =
Guardians&quot; is <br>
  scheduled to feature TV and movie industry stars, giving the film <br>
  that extra boost of mass appeal. KDSC's theater release is based <br>
  upon the theme and characters in the nationally available <br>
  Guardian's board game (100% owned by KDSC) which is used in over <br>
  400 elementary schools and has been featured on a major nationally =
<br>
  syndicated afternoon TV talk show.</p>
<p>Judging by the numbers, major full length films of this type that =
<br>
  reach out not just to kids but entire families, have enjoyed huge <br>
  box office success. This is based on a release of over 1,000 <br>
  screens, right in line with Company expectations for their premier =
<br>
  in just the US alone. But the box office revenues are only a <br>
  fraction of the huge income that is typically realized from a film. =
<br>
  To maximize profits everything from action figures, clothing, <br>
  and toys, to children's party favors and lunch boxes are scheduled =
<br>
  for national merchandising in order to extend the brand and <br>
  generate revenue.</p>
<p>If this were the whole story, it would be more than enough to <br>
  justify a strong buy recommendation for KDSC. However, this isn't <br>
  even the tip of the iceberg. The really big income will most likely =
<br>
  be in VCR/DVD sales after the movie has run in theaters. Anyone who =
<br>
  has small children or grandchildren knows that the VCR/DVD is <br>
  today's electronic baby sitter. Children watch films over and over =
<br>
  again memorizing all the songs and story lines. It is very realistic =
<br>
  by today's standards to see video and DVD sales hit the $100 <br>
  Million mark, especially with the availability at retail super-stores =
<br>
  and the Internet. One of the most magnificent facts about children's =
<br>
  movies is that a new generation is born every 7 years to enjoy <br>
  re-releases as well as home video.</p>
<p>KDSC has cemented partnerships that will enhance their entertainment =
<br>
  products, increase distribution channels, and accelerate growth. <br>
  Dynamic gains are realized in the early growth stages of a burgeoning =
<br>
  entertainment company that has nailed the blueprint for success. <br>
  Savvy investors with an eye for value can benefit from the tremendous =
<br>
  profits that will launch the fortunes of this new film and <br>
  entertainment powerhouse.</p>
