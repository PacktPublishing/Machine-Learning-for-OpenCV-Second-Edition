Dear Sir/Madam,<BR>
<BR>
You may be surprise to receive this letter from me since you do not know =
me personally. The purpose of my mail is that I am Mr. Peter Stevens, =
the Second son of Dr. Dennis Stevens, who was&nbsp; murdered some time =
ago in the land dispute in Zimbabwe. I am writing from Holland (The =
Netherlands) where I am currently based as a political asylum =
seeker.<BR>
<BR>
Before the death of my father, he took me to Amsterdam in Holland to =
deposit the sum of (US$18.9M) Eighteen million, Nine Hundred Thousand =
United States Dollars only, in a private Security and Finance Company. =
May be he for-saw the looming danger in Zimbabwe? But this money was put =
in a box as gemstones before it was deposited to avoid much tax and =
demurrage from the security company. This money was initially meant to =
purchase new Machines and Chemicals for the farms and also to establish =
a new farm in Swaziland.<BR>
<BR>
The land problem came when the government of Zimbabwe under the =
leadership of President Robert Mugabe, introduced a new land use =
decree/act that, affected a lot of rich white farmers and some few =
blacks. This resulted to the mob action and killing by Zimbabwe war =
Veterans and some Lunatics in the society, so to say. Infact, a lot of =
people were killed in this land reform act, including my father.<BR>
<BR>
It is against this back-ground, that I consulted with my family to =
transfer this money out of Holland to a foreign account since I am now =
staying in Holland and the law of Netherlands, forbids a refugee (asylum =
Seeker) to have such a money in an account. I am therefore saddled with =
the responsibility by my Family to seek for a genuine Person with =
foreign account to handle this transaction. I am faced with the dilemma =
of investing this amount of money in the Netherlands because; I will not =
like to go through the same experience in future since both countries =
have similar history. Moreover, The Netherlands foreign exchange does =
not allow such investment from asylum seekers.<BR>
<BR>
I must let you know that this transaction is risk free. If you accept to =
assist me and my family, you will need to come to Amsterdam The =
Netherlands&nbsp; to open &#147;a non resident account &#147;which will =
aid us in the transfer of the money&nbsp; into any account you will =
provide .This money is meant for investment purpose in any lucrative =
business of your choice.<BR>
<BR>
I have two options of offers for your assistance.You may go into =
partnership with me in any business you decides to invest the money on =
with the shearing of the profit carefully spelt out if agreed upon, or =
you may decide to have 20% of the total sum, 70% will be for me and my =
family and the remaining 10% will be set aside for un-forseen expenses =
that may be incurred in the cause of pursuing this transaction to a =
successful end.<BR>
<BR>
You may contact me on the above Medias so that I know what your decision =
is, about this proposal.Please note that your field of specialization is =
not a hindreance to this transaction.<BR>
<BR>
Thank for your anticipated co-operations.<BR>
<BR>
Peter Stevens.<BR>
