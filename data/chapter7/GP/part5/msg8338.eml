You may guess what an improvement is this automatic Record of Events, =
which<BR>
is as reliable as Truth itself. Nothing can be altered or falsified, for =
the<BR>
vibratory currents convey the actual events to your vision, even as =
they<BR>
happen<BR>
But suppose, said Rob, that something important should happen while =
I'm<BR>
asleep, or not looking at the box? I have called this a Record, replied =
the<BR>
Demon, and such it really is, although I have shown you only such events =
as<BR>
are in process of being recorded<BR>
