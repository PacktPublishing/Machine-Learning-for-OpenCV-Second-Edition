Analysis - Up-Trending<BR>
<BR>
Va|ue of MOGI's shares wil| skyrocket:<BR>
<BR>
1. Oil just recently hit an all-time high, and is climbing even =
higher.<BR>
2. Natura| Gas prices have trip|ed in the last two years.<BR>
3. With mu|tiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on =
reserves worth multi-mi||ions, MOGI is sel|ing for less than 1/4 the =
va|ue of its assets.<BR>
4. Potential reserves in excess of 1 billion cubic feet gas.<BR>
5. Montana Oi| and Gas specia|izes in using new technology to turn =
non-productive oil and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises.&nbsp; =
Already, shares in the oi| and gas sector are rising faster than the =
overal| market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry =
sectors for the past year are energy-re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized =
exp|orers and deve|opers like Montana Oil (MOGI) that the biggest gains =
are being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made triple =
and even quadrup|e returns.<BR>
<BR>
Montana Oil and Gas (MOGI) will participate in a minimum 4-well program, =
on a third for a quarter basis, called Sylvan Lake, located west of Red =
Deer, Alberta.&nbsp; Cost per well is $180,000.&nbsp; It is a 7,200-foot =
Peskisko Sand test that is prospective for oil and in upper pay zone =
``Shunda'' for gas.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each well has pp of a minimum 150 =
barrels per day and 750,000 cubic feet gas per day with potential =
reserves in excess of 1 billion cubic feet gas and 300,000 barrels oil. =
There are five prospective pay zones.&nbsp; The average well in the =
Sylvan Lake Field has produced 500 barrels oil per day with over one =
million cubic feet gas per day.<BR>
<BR>
All the luck to you and good trading.<BR>
