many<BR>
microcap stocks, today's company has additional risk<BR>
factors that raise doubt about its ability to continue<BR>
as a going concern. Today's featured company is not a<BR>
reporting company registered under the Securities Act<BR>
of 1934 and hence there is limited information<BR>
available about the company. Other factors include a<BR>
limited operating history, a nominal cash position and<BR>
nominal revenues in its most recent quarter. The<BR>
company is going to need financing. If that financing<BR>
does not occur,the company may not be able to complete<BR>
some proposed transactions and the company may not be<BR>
able to continue as a going concern in which case you<BR>
could lose your entire investment. Other risks and<BR>
uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the<BR>
ability of the Company to complete its business<BR>
plan,reliance on key personnel, market conditions, the<BR>
general acceptance of the Company's products and<BR>
technologies, competitive factors, timing, and other<BR>
risks associated with their business. The publisher of<BR>
