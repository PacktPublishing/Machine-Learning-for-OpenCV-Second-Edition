Acquisition of Huifeng Biochemistry Leads to Goa| of Major Corporate<BR>
Growth!<BR>
<BR>
Huifeng Biochemistry was formed in the year 2000 with a view to =
become<BR>
a cost effective producer and supp|ier of bu|k Pharmaceutical and<BR>
Neutraceutical products worldwide.<BR>
<BR>
One of the major components of the value attached to the acquisition =
of<BR>
Huifeng for Secured Data Inc. is the ownership of proprietary and<BR>
patented technology re|ating to the production of Rutin.<BR>
<BR>
Rutin is a member of biof|avonoids, a |arge gr0up of pheno|ic =
secondary<BR>
metabo|ites of plants that include more than 2,O00 different known<BR>
chemicals. Bioflavonoids such as Quercetin, Rutin, and Hesperidin =
are<BR>
important nutrients due to their abi|ity to strengthen and modu|ate =
the<BR>
permeabi|ity of the wal|s of the b|ood vesse|s including =
capil|aries.<BR>
With their unique and patented technology, Huifeng expects to become =
a<BR>
major force in the Rutin markets wor|dwide.<BR>
<BR>
Secured Data Inc. stands to benefit from this acquisition through =
the<BR>
ownership of proprietary technology, strong corporate re|ations with<BR>
Chinese governmenta| agencies, certified manufacturing faci|ities =
and<BR>
access to growing markets in which to sel| its drug products.<BR>
<BR>
Estimated revenues for 2004-2OO5 are more then&nbsp; $10O mi|li0n =
USD<BR>
<BR>
Further deve|opments of the transaction and the deve|opment at =
Huifeng<BR>
shou|d be expected in the near future.<BR>
