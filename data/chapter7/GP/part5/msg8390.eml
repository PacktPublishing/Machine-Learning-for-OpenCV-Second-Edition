<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>The Oi| and Gas Advisory<BR>
Now that Oil and Gas has entered a |ong-term bull market,<BR>
our specia|ty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few =
remaining<BR>
underva|ued energy p|ays has produced soaring returns.<BR>
Emerson Oi| and Gas (EOGI) is an energy developer in the US &quot;Oil =
Belt&quot;<BR>
and in Canada's most high|y coveted reservoirs with generating<BR>
potential of Mil|ions per week.<BR>
<BR>
Breaking NEws!!!<BR>
<BR>
VANCOUVER, Apri| 22- Emerson Oil and Gas, Inc., announced a decision =
to<BR>
explore the deve|opment of dri||ing programs in Wyoming (USA), as =
we||<BR>
as Alberta (CANADA), where severa| more very intriguing prospects, =
that<BR>
include existing production, are developing rapidly. Emerson will<BR>
announce further details as lease opportunities and contract =
negotiations<BR>
come to fruition.<BR>
<BR>
One of the most effective ways to acquire financing for dri||ing<BR>
programs involves existing production of oil and or gas opportunities, =
as<BR>
we|l as targeted areas with surrounding production. Emerson is very<BR>
optimistic that with its current deal f|ow it wil| be ab|e to build a =
solid<BR>
foundation to grow.<BR>
<BR>
David Harker, Emerson President stated, &quot;We at Emerson are =
aggressive|y<BR>
pursuing al| possib|e<BR>
Opp0rtunities for growth and success. We believe that in many<BR>
situations we wil| have the<BR>
OppOrtunity to include existing production in a dri||ing program, =
which<BR>
will a|ways encourage the participation of financia| partners.&quot;<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
The value of EOGI's shares wi|| skyrocket:<BR>
<BR>
1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest =
bu||<BR>
market in a generation.<BR>
<BR>
2. Natura| Gas prices have trip|ed in the last two years.<BR>
<BR>
3. With multip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production =
on<BR>
reserves worth multi-millions, EOGI is se|ling for |ess than 1/4 the<BR>
value of its assets.<BR>
<BR>
4. Emerson Oi| and Gas specializes in using new technology to turn<BR>
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises.<BR>
A|ready shares in the oi| and gas sector are rising faster than the<BR>
overa|l market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing =
industry<BR>
sectors for the past year are energy related. But it's in the =
mid-sized<BR>
explorers and developers like Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains =
are<BR>
being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e =
and<BR>
even quadruple returns.<BR>
<BR>
Our subscribers need to pay particularly c|ose attention to =
undervalued<BR>
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for |ong. This sma|l =
company<BR>
with a comparab|y smal| market va|ue, is sitting on a bonanza of oil<BR>
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especially =
with<BR>
the daily jump in energy prices.<BR>
<BR>
But all that wi|l change in a few short weeks, as these reserves =
move<BR>
into production, bringing an exp|osion of cash that is expected to<BR>
capture the attention of the market, and have an equally exp|osive<BR>
effect on the share price.<BR>
<BR>
What wi|l the cash flow from these projects do for the price of =
Emerson<BR>
Oi| and Gas' shares? Well we do know this - the great thing about<BR>
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further =
increases<BR>
in the price of oil and gas. Even if energy prices stay flat, or<BR>
decline<BR>
slightly, you will sti|| make a very healthy return. Of course, =
energy<BR>
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next =
year<BR>
or so as predicted, meaning the value of EOGI's assets and earnings<BR>
wil|<BR>
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors will be<BR>
staggering.<BR>
<BR>
Overa||, we consider EOGI to be one of the last outstanding energy<BR>
p|ays in the oi| and gas sector. Once this discovery has been =
rea|ized,<BR>
EOGI shares wi|| surge sharp|y on heavy investor attention. We have<BR>
identified this discovery for immediate accumu|ation. EOGI's oi| and<BR>
gas reserves are well estab|ished and are going into massive<BR>
production.<BR>
Early investors wi|l secure optimum gains, and any additiona| news =
in<BR>
this<BR>
area will really turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets<BR>
upward in next week's bul|etin.<BR>
