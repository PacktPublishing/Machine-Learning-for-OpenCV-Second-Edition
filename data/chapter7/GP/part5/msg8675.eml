<BR>In the last analysis, our only freedom is the freedom to discipline =
ourselves.
<BR><BR>The grass may be greener on the other side of the fence, but you =
still have to mow it.



<BR><BR>Experience does not err. Only your judgments err by expecting =
from her what is not in her power.<BR>Fears are nothing more than states =
of mind.<BR><BR>To always be loved one must ever be agreeable.
<BR>I have discovered that people with money have no imagination, and =
people with imagination have no money.<br>Nature is seldom in the wrong, =
custom always.<BR>He who feels no compassion will become insane.


<br><br>America is like an unfaithful love who promises us more than we =
got.

<BR><BR>The timid are afraid before the danger, the cowardly while in =
danger, and the courageous after danger.
<br>Mankind, when left to themselves, are unfit for their own =
government.<br><br>People find life entirely too time-consuming.



<BR><BR>I would rather not be a king than to forfeit my liberty.



One feels inclined to say that the intention that man should be =
''happy'' is not included in the plan of ''Creation.''



<br><br>Live to learn, learn to live, then teach others.



<br>Come into the light of things. Let nature be your teacher.Princes =
and governments are far more dangerous than other elements within =
society.<A href=3D"http://purkyne.info/2c93c54538f894f4ff3dd4c9b/T.html" =
