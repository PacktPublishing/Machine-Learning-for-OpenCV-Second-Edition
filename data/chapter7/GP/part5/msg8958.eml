&gt;A kiss can be a comma, a question mark or an exclamation point. =
That's basic spelling that every woman ought to know.<BR>
&gt;Every new idea is an impossibility until it is born.<BR>
&gt;I don't like that man. I'm going to have to get to know him =
better.<BR>
&gt;There is no stronger bond of friendship than a mutual enemy.<BR>
&gt;Naivete in grownups is often charming but when coupled with vanity =
it is indistinguishable from stupidity.<BR>
&gt;Faith, to my mind, is a stiffening process, a sort of mental starch, =
which ought to be applied as sparingly as possible.<BR>
&gt;Empire and liberty.<BR>
&gt;Kind words can be short and easy to speak, but their echoes are =
truly endless.<BR>
&gt;Dishonesty, cowardice and duplicity are never impulsive.<BR>
&gt;Wicked people are always surprised to find ability in those that are =
good.<BR>
&gt;True happiness comes from the joy of deeds well done, the zest of =
creating things new.<BR>
&gt;Confidence is a lot of this game or any game. If you don't think you =
can, you won't.<BR>
&gt;Genius begins great works labor alone finishes them.<BR>
&gt;Do not on any account attempt to write on both sides of the paper at =
once.<BR>
&gt;A true friend is one who overlooks your failures and tolerates your =
successes.<BR>
&gt;No great thing is created suddenly.<BR>
&gt;Communism is a cow of many well milked and badly fed.<BR>
&gt;There is no means of proving it is preferable to be than not to =
be.<BR>
&gt;Food is an important part of a balanced diet.<BR>
