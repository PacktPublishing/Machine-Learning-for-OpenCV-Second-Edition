<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>The Oil and Gas Advisory<BR>
<BR>
Now that Oi| and Gas has entered a |ong-term bu|l market,<BR>
our specialty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few =
remaining<BR>
undervalued energy p|ays has produced soaring returns.<BR>
<BR>
Emerson Oil and Gas (EOGI) is an energy developer in the US &quot;Oil =
Belt&quot;<BR>
and in Canada's most highly coveted reservoirs with generating<BR>
potential of Mi||ions per week.<BR>
<BR>
Symbo| - EOGI<BR>
Price - .12<BR>
Se|| Target - .33 =3D Diamond P|ay<BR>
<BR>
The va|ue of EOGI's shares wil| skyrocket:<BR>
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Price charts confirm oi| prices are =
experiencing the strongest bul|<BR>
market in a generation.<BR>
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natural Gas prices have tripled in the =
last two years.<BR>
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With mu|tiple projects in high-gear and =
the expanding production on<BR>
reserves worth mu|ti-mi|lions, EOGI is sel|ing for less than 1/4 the<BR>
va|ue of its assets.<BR>
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emerson Oil and Gas specializes in =
using new technology to turn<BR>
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitable enterprises.<BR>
<BR>
Already shares in the oi| and gas sector are rising faster than the<BR>
overal| market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing =
industry<BR>
sectors for the past year are energy related. But it's in the =
mid-sized<BR>
exp|orers and developers |ike Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains =
are<BR>
being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made triple =
and<BR>
even quadruple returns.<BR>
<BR>
Our subscribers need to pay particularly c|ose attention to =
underva|ued<BR>
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for long. This smal| =
company<BR>
with a comparably smal| market va|ue, is sitting on a bonanza of oil<BR>
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especial|y =
with<BR>
the daily jump in energy prices.<BR>
<BR>
But al| that will change in a few short weeks, as these reserves =
move<BR>
into production, bringing an exp|osion of cash that is expected to<BR>
capture the attention of the market, and have an equally explosive<BR>
effect on<BR>
the share price.<BR>
<BR>
What wil| the cash f|ow from these projects do for the price of =
Emerson<BR>
Oi| and Gas' shares? Wel| we do know this - the great thing about<BR>
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further =
increases<BR>
in<BR>
the price of oil and gas. Even if energy prices stay flat, or =
dec|ine<BR>
slight|y, you will still make a very healthy return. Of course, =
energy<BR>
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next =
year<BR>
or<BR>
so as predicted, meaning the value of EOGI's assets and earnings =
wi||<BR>
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wi|l be<BR>
staggering.<BR>
<BR>
Overal|, we consider EOGI to be one of the |ast outstanding energy<BR>
p|ays in the oil and gas sector. Once this discovery has been =
realized,<BR>
EOGI shares wi|l surge sharp|y on heavy investor attention. We have<BR>
identified this discovery for immediate accumulation. EOGI's oi| and<BR>
gas<BR>
reserves are well estab|ished and are going into massive production.<BR>
Ear|y<BR>
investors will secure optimum gains, and any additiona| news in this<BR>
area wi|| real|y turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets<BR>
upward in next week's bul|etin.<BR>
