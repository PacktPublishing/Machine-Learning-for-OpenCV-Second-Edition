Hi Varou,=20
<p>
A period of depressed mood which lasts for several days or a few weeks =
is a normal part of life and is not necessarily a cause for concern. =
Although these feelings are often referred to as "depression," they =
typically do not constitute a clinical depression because the symptoms =
are relatively mild and of short duration. Moreover, milder periods of =
depression are often related to stressful life events and improvement =
frequently coincides with positive life changes.
<p>
Because you can add more to your life by choosing your medications and =
treatment online. We provide what you need.
<p>
Everything is done on-line and Safe... <a =
