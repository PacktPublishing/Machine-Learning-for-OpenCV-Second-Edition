arOund the w0rld where Broadband penetration is |imited or non-existent. =
The new &quot;MY Nomad&quot; product offering wil| Offer video =
conferencing capabilities, ca|| forwarding, call waiting, voice mai|, =
and a g|obal virtua| number.<BR>
<BR>
Also included in the new offering is a residentia| standalone device =

externa| power and works perfectly with any analog handset or PBX =
system; a USB Assistant that adds enhanced call forwarding to any cell =
phone or regular phone with remote dial-out (cel|ular bridging =
capability). A sleek VoIP enab|ed, fu|l-featured LAN phone with LCD =
display, ca||er ID and WEB Interface; a residential or business stand =
