&gt; Subject: Research on semi-structured document classification<BR>
&gt; using Ling-Spam dataset<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Dear Ion,<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; As requested in the readme file accompanying the Ling-Spam<BR>
&gt; dataset, I would like to notify you of my work on<BR>
&gt; semi-structured document classification which makes use of<BR>
&gt; the Ling-Spam dataset.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Tests on the Ling-Spam dataset (among others) indicate an<BR>
&gt; improvement in classifier performance when using structural<BR>
&gt; information. For Ling-Spam this means simply that words that<BR>
&gt; occur in the title and words that occur in the body are<BR>
&gt; treated as two distinct word distributions. These two<BR>
&gt; distributions are smoothed (blended) with the consolidated<BR>
&gt; word distribution from both the title and the body. My<BR>
&gt; baseline classifier is flat-text Naive Bayes.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; I have attached a copy of a conference publication outlining<BR>
&gt; my work, which includes experimental results on Ling-Spam.<BR>
&gt; Results are only given in terms of classification accuracy,<BR>
&gt; since spam-specific performance measures are not relevant to<BR>
&gt; this work. The paper has been submitted to the &quot;13th<BR>
&gt; International Electrotechnical and Computer Science<BR>
&gt; Conference ERK'2004&quot;, which will be held in Portoroz, =
Slovenia.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Regards,<BR>
&gt; Andrej Bratko<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; P.S.: I am sincerely sorry for not citing your work in the<BR>
&gt; publication. The text length limit was extremely short, so I<BR>
&gt; had to be very conservative with the citations (I did include<BR>
&gt; a link to your site, however).<BR>
