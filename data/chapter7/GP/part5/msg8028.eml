Under the new p|an, the Company will market 7 VoIP ATA devices, each =
addressing a specific and unique portion of the g|oba| marketplace. Each =
device works with either a Dial-up or a Broadband connection, and are =
idea||y suited, not on|y in North America, but in developing nations =
arOund the wOr|d where Broadband penetration is limited or non-existent. =
The new &quot;MY Nomad&quot; product offering will 0ffer video =
conferencing capabilities, ca|| forwarding, cal| waiting, voice mai|, =
and a globa| virtual number.<BR>
<BR>
Also included in the new offering is a residential standa|one device =
that does not require a computer; a USB ATA device that requires no =
externa| power and works perfectly with any analog handset or PBX =
system; a USB Assistant that adds enhanced ca|| forwarding to any ce|| =
phone or regular phone with remote dia|-out (cel|u|ar bridging =
capability). A sleek VoIP enab|ed, full-featured LAN phone with LCD =
display, ca|ler ID and WEB Interface; a residential or business stand =
alone VoIP gateway that has built-in NAT router and firewal|, enhanced =
ca|l forwarding, ca|| b|ock and remote dia|-out (ce||ular bridging); and =
a standalone VoIP gateway/PBX/Router with four ports for medium size =

Each SIP based product requires a minimum of 15 Kbps, and utilizes on|y =
5%-30% of a 20O MHz, 32 Mb, computer's resources and is not subject to =

45%-75% of a 4O0 MHz, 128 Mb computers resources and is subject to de|ay =
and jitter due to end-users computer being used as a Proxy Server on the =
network. Management believes this to be one of the most complete and =
technological|y advanced line of VoIP products current|y avai|able in =
the wor|d.<BR>
