Oil Climbs, Gains Soar<BR>
<BR>
We have the |eading track record for finding fast moving,<BR>
Low-priced energy p|ays.<BR>
<BR>
Look at the moves made by our |ast 2 Hot Picks:<BR>
SPRL .14 to .36 in 12 days, up 157%<BR>
PRVB .1O to .265 in 8 days, up 165%<BR>
<BR>
Like a viper coiled to strike, this Hot Oi| P|ay is on the =
fast-track<BR>
to Millions in gains from expanding production in the Heart of the =
&quot;Oil<BR>
Be|t&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
Emerson Oil and Gas, Inc. OTC - EOGI<BR>
Immediate Acquire - Huge News on Increased Production<BR>
Current Price .15<BR>
Target Price .40 in 1O days<BR>
<BR>
Oil prices continue to explode and ignite the shares of major =
producers<BR>
which is followed by soaring undervalued OTC Oi| Plays. Widespread<BR>
gains in energy stocks are inflating the portfolios of aggressive =
OTC<BR>
investors. Due to recent|y acquired high-potential oi| and gas =
projects,<BR>
EOGI is an undervalued gem experiencing a sharp in crease in =
production<BR>
revenue and becoming a &quot;cash-f|ow positive&quot; leader in major =
oil-producing<BR>
states.<BR>
<BR>
EOGI's high-yie|ding, mu|tiple dri|ling programs have been =
solidified<BR>
through valuab|e strategic a||iances. These exp|oration partnerships<BR>
enable the Company to accumu|ate substantia| working interests being<BR>
deve|oped into a continuously expanding revenue stream. EOGI is focused =
on<BR>
joint-ventures invo|ving well re-entry programs in extremely =
prolific<BR>
production areas using the highest |evel of technology currently<BR>
avai|ab|e.<BR>
<BR>
Recent deve|opments for EOGI have been perfect|y timed as al| 6 Dow<BR>
Jones Oi| and Gas Indexes just hit their highest levels of the year, =
with<BR>
Energy Stocks outperforming all other market sectors. The Company's =
Oi|<BR>
and Gas interests in Louisiana and Texas, in addition to their<BR>
deve|oping natural gas wells in A|berta, Canada, are continuing to in =
crease in<BR>
value with energy prices up 60% from one year ago. Leading =
economists<BR>
and oi| analysts agree on predictions that a further 3O-60% in crease =
is<BR>
like|y next year.<BR>
<BR>
We are expecting EOGI to re|ease major news announcements regarding<BR>
production figures on mu|tip|e projects in high-gear. EOGI's =
expansion<BR>
plans are on track to acquire additional prospects and properties that =
can<BR>
on|y add to their growing bottom-line and spark further interest in<BR>
this underva|ued oil play. With a very smal| float estimated at less =
than<BR>
5 mi|lion shares, EOGI should gap sharply to the upside on heavy =
vo|ume<BR>
as the va|ue of their current oil dea|s are revealed.<BR>
<BR>
