EDMOND,  Okla. BUSINESS WIRE Oct.  15, 2004. uAuthorize Corporation,
Pink  Sheets:UACP,  a  global  Internet  marketer  of  business  and
Internet  solutions,  announced  today  that  its  VOIP technologies
division has completed a marketing  agreement  for  the  IPT  2.1  -
Internet  Telephony Handset, as an add-on product for its voice over
Internet telephony services, currently under final development.  The
IPT 2.1 is  a  second  generation  telephone  handset for computers,
specifically designed for home/SOHO  users  of  Internet  telephony.
Until  now,  users making Internet phone calls from a PC have used a
microphone and speaker  connected  to  the  soundcard.  Others use a
headset combining earphones and a microphone.  Both of these systems
have their drawbacks. 1. The use of a speaker limits the privacy  of
the  phone  call  and  gives  the familiar feedback problem when the
microphone picks up the  speaker  output.   2.  The headset solution
avoids the feed-back but does not allow you to hear the ring  of  an
incoming call, unless you keep it on your head all the time.<p>

The IPT 2.1 permits the  user  to  make phone calls via the Internet
with the same comfort and  convenience  offered  by  a  conventional
telephone  handset.  You pick it up when you need it, and you put it
back on its cradle when you are finished with your call. "We believe
this product makes  the  entire  Internet  telephony experience more
traditional for the average user, and thereby encourages more use of
VOIP services instead  of  traditional  phone  calls,"  stated  Dino
Price, president of uAuthorize.<p>

The company released Ground Breaking  news about its VOIP division!!
Although some would argue that VoIP  is  still  maturing,  corporate
users  are  extremely  interested  in  implementing  the technology,
creating  exponential  growth.  Within  the  last  four  years, VoIP
minutes increased from less  than  0.5  to  2  percent  of  outbound
international  calls,  according  to  research  from  TeleGeography.
Additionally,  predictions as to the size of the market itself vary,
with Allied Business Intelligence projecting the VoIP market to grow
from 3.7 billion  in  2000  to  12.3  billion  in 2006  and  Synergy
Research  projecting the VoIP  equipment  market  to  grow  to  13.3
billion by 2005.<p>

want to wait until it is too late. Like many of these stocks, it may
move quickly and timing is critical.<p>
