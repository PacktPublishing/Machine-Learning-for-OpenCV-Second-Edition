Shyamalan says there is a scene in The Village that was so scary that =
it<BR>
would have earned the entire film an R rating. He changed one piece of =
sound<BR>
!* of something that wasn't even happening on screen !* and it made the =
film<BR>
suitable for a PG-13 rating.<BR>
&quot;They thought they had a sure-fire&nbsp;&nbsp; and it's turned into =
a game that's<BR>
causing a lot of problems for them,&quot; he said. &quot;It makes them =
look at the<BR>
next few products and say, 'Let's not just throw money at MMOs. And I =
think<BR>
that's good advice for the whole industry, to be a little more careful =
and<BR>
more choosy.&quot;<BR>
