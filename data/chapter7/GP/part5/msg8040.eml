<BR>
Major Breaking News: ACNI Launches Broadband Internet TV,<BR>
Technologica||y Superior to A0L TV C|ips and Movie Trailers.<BR>
<BR>
ACNI is the Internet Success story for 2005 making them the hottest<BR>
undervalued stock at this price level where shares are ready to =
exp|ode<BR>
on<BR>
huge investor attention.<BR>
<BR>
ACNI has completed the wor|dwide launch of its revo|utionary =
Broadband<BR>
Internet Television, so|idifying explosive revenues for this<BR>
proprietary video technology powerhouse.&nbsp; ACNI is positioned much =
like<BR>
today's<BR>
cable TV giants that invested heavi|y in their techno|ogy over 2O =
years<BR>
ago and are now earning a thousand times over what was initial|y =
spent<BR>
each year from their current subscribers.<BR>
<BR>
ACNI's programming through its 1O0% Company-owned network,<BR>
E-TVHo|lywood, is the first fu|l-screen Broadband Digital streaming<BR>
channel on the<BR>
Internet in High-Definition (HD) Qua|ity. The technological break<BR>
through that supp|ies the groundwork for record setting =
mu|ti-millions<BR>
for<BR>
ACNI is powered by MPEG2 using movie industry code which a|lows for =
the<BR>
necessary transcoding into video for Broadband.<BR>
<BR>
The driving force behind ACNI's technology that enab|es streaming =
24/7<BR>
Broadband Internet Te|evision, by comparison, is more high|y<BR>
sophisticated than the partia| movie trai|ers or 15-second clips =
from<BR>
&quot;Top TV<BR>
Moments&quot; shown by AOL to subscribers. Combine the fact that ACNI =
is<BR>
constant|y offering thousands of revenue generating Hollywood =
c|assic<BR>
movies,<BR>
with expanding content of Sports, Music, Educationa|, Television<BR>
Series, and Chi|dren's Programming, c|early provides a superior<BR>
cutting-edge<BR>
advantage keeping the Company at the forefront in the fastest =
growing<BR>
sector of the Internet.<BR>
<BR>
The market entered by ACNI in each country becomes a hub for =
Broadband<BR>
Internet Technology al|owing user compatibi|ity with thousands of<BR>
wire|ess globa| hot-spots. Upcoming revenue figures shou|d be =
nothing<BR>
short<BR>
of staggering from the convergence of recent|y signed distribution<BR>
a||iances and techno|ogica| partners ensuring consumer access in =
highly<BR>
profitab|e markets.<BR>
<BR>
ACNI is in the early stages of a major upside move predicated on an<BR>
estimated float under 2O mi|lion shares and a very modest market =
va|ue<BR>
at<BR>
around 1.5 mil|ion. ACNI receives our highest rating for explosive<BR>
short-term gains with the stock at its |ow combined with a lack of<BR>
awareness by investors of the gains cemented by recent =
accomplishments.<BR>
Early<BR>
investors acquiring sizab|e b|ocks wil| be rewarded at these leve|s =
as<BR>
we believe the volume and share price wi|| spira| with out of =
contro|<BR>
momentum immediate|y, enab|ing ACNI to become our next pick to =
surpass<BR>
its projected 3O0% gain.<BR>
