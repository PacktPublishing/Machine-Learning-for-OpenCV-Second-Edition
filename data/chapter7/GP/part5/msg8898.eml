<br>Affairs are easier of entrance than of exit and it is but common =
prudence to see our way out before we venture in.
<BR><BR>Has this world been so kind to you that you should leave with =
regret? There are better things ahead than any we leave behind.

<br>When you get to fifty-two food becomes more important than sex.



<br>Christianity is completed Judaism or it is nothing.


It is better to be hated for what you are than to be loved for what you =
are not.<br><br>His life was a sort of dream, as are most lives with the =
mainspring left out.
If there was no faith there would be no living in this world. We could =
not even eat hash with any safety.<BR>He who would acquire fame must not =
show himself afraid of censure. The dread of censure is the death of =
genius.It's motive alone which gives character to the actions of men.


One thing about the school of experience is that it will repeat the =
lesson if you flunk the first time.The easiest thing to find on God's =
green earth is someone to tell you all the things you cannot do.
<br>Anger makes dull men witty -- but it keeps them poor.

<BR>By a lie, a man...annihilates his dignity as a man.



As the family goes, so goes the nation and so goes the whole world in =
which we live.



<br>The avarice person is ever in want let your desired aim have a fixed =
limit.



<BR><BR>The happiest part of a man's life is what he passes lying awake =
in bed in the morning.<BR>Honest error is to be pitied, not ridiculed.
<br>The smaller the head, the bigger the dream.
