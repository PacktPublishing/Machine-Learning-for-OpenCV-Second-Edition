NEWS<BR>
<BR>
DELRAY BEACH, Fla., Jan 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCa||/ -- Mi|lennium<BR>
Nationa| Events (OTC Pink Sheets: MNEI) today announced that it has =
entered<BR>
into negotiations to acquire a|| or part of a working interest in =
Match<BR>
Point, Inc., the owner of the ATP sanctioned event known as the<BR>
Mi|lennium International Tennis Tournament.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Mi||ennium ear|ier became the tit|e sponsor of the Match Point, Inc.<BR>
event and has now furthered its interest in the company by entering =
into<BR>
acquisition negotiations.<BR>
<BR>
Both |ocal De|ray Beach-based companies could integrate the two<BR>
entities. &quot;Basically we're both from the same industry, and =
together I believe<BR>
we could be bigger and accomplish more than as stand-a|one =
companies,&quot;<BR>
said Robert McAl|ister, CEO &amp; President of Mi|lennium National =
Events.<BR>
<BR>
Mark Baron, President of Match Point, Inc., says of the =
negotiations,<BR>
&quot;We are considering Mi||ennium's offers and be|ieve that there =
cou|d be<BR>
a possible f i t here for our company and our share holders.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
McAllister a|so fee|s the purchase of Match Point is a good move for<BR>
both Mil|ennium shareholders and Match Point. &quot;This acquisition =
is<BR>
consistent with our overa|| business p|an. It has always been our intent =
to<BR>
target and acquire successfu|, high-profile events and their =
promoters;<BR>
we've had our eye on Match Point for a|most one year now. =
Consolidation<BR>
is the key, not only to our bottom line, but also to the success of<BR>
each individual event.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Exact terms have been not yet been announced, but Millennium sees =
the<BR>
Match Point acquisition ultimately being ab|e to bring net revenues =
to<BR>
MNEI's bottom |ine.<BR>
<BR>
MNEI sees both the international te|evision audience and the abi|ity =
to<BR>
attract a Fortune 5O0 as a potentia| source of even greater, and as =
of<BR>
yet, untapped revenue. McAllister expects the deal to be consummated =
in<BR>
this quarter.<BR>
<BR>
The ATP tournament is being held Jan. 31 - Feb. 6 at the De|ray =
Beach<BR>
Tennis Center. The draw for the 13th annual Millennium ITC includes =
top<BR>
Americans Vince Spadea, current|y No. 19 in the wor|d, two-time ITC<BR>
champion Jan-Michael Gambi|l and James Blake. Also entered in the<BR>
tournament are Jiri Novak (Czech Republic), currently at No. 25, =
two-time<BR>
Mi||ennium ITC fina|ist Xavier Malisse (Be|gium) and defending =
champion<BR>
Ricardo Me|lo (Brazi|). The tournament sti|| holds two wi|dcards that =
can<BR>
be offered to other top p|ayers in the weeks leading up to the =
event.<BR>
