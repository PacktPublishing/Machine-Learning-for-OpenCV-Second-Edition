Hi Varou,=20
<p>
Taking the impotence drug with alcohol and food. I also noticed that =
drinking alcohol reduced the effectiveness of the impotence drug. My =
solution was NO alcohol before sex, and only the 25 mg dose. Taking the =
impotence drug with alcohol and food. Works great, and no side effects =
noticed. - Phil, Age 60, California
