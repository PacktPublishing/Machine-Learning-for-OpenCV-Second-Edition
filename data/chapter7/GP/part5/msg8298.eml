<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>FROM RACHEAL ALBERT,<BR>
CONTACT EMAIL&nbsp; ADDRESS:rachealalbert@netscape.net<BR>
Attn:The Director/Owner,<BR>
<BR>
URGENT AND STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL<BR>
<BR>
How are you? I know you may be surprised to receive this letter, I am =
a<BR>
widow requesting for an assistance . Firstly, I am MRS.Racheal K. =
Albert.<BR>
<BR>
The wife of Late MR. K. Albert who was recently murdered in the<BR>
land dispute&nbsp; in Zimbabwe. I got your contact through the South =
African<BR>
Trade and Business&nbsp; Information services and I assure you that =
nobody knows<BR>
about this transaction&nbsp; except me, my two sons. Before the death of =
my Husband.<BR>
He took me to&nbsp; the Netherlands to deposit the sum of US$15.6 =
Million (Fifteen<BR>
Million Six Hundred&nbsp; Thousand United States Dollars) in a private =
Security<BR>
Company, when He foresees&nbsp; the looming danger in Zimbabwe. This =
money was<BR>
deposited as family valuables to avoid much demurrage cost from&nbsp; =
the Security<BR>
Company. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines&nbsp; =
and chemicals<BR>
for the farms and also for the establishment of a new farm in&nbsp; =
Swaziland.<BR>
The land disputes started when Zimbabwean President<BR>
MR. ROBERT MUGABE introduced a new Land Act reform which wholly<BR>
affected the rich white&nbsp; farmers and some few black farmers.<BR>
<BR>
This resulted to many killings by Zimbabwe&nbsp; war veterans and some =
lunatics<BR>
in the society. In fact, a lot of people were&nbsp; killed because of =
this land<BR>
reformed Act for which my husband was one of the victims. It is on =
this<BR>
background that My family and I,who are currently&nbsp; staying in the =
Netherlands<BR>
as refugees decided to transfer my Husband?s money to a&nbsp; foreign =
country<BR>
since the laws of Netherlands prohibits refugees from opening a bank =
account<BR>
that can contain a huge sum or to be involved in any financial =
transaction<BR>
throughout the territorial zones of Netherlands.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; Please, I need your assistance to transfer this fund to your =
trusted overseas<BR>
bank account. For your efforts and assistance, I have agreed to give =
you<BR>
25% of the total sum, while 5% is mapped out to re-imburse all the =
expenses<BR>
incurred in the course of this transaction and 70% will be for my =
family<BR>
investment in&nbsp; your country. Note that this transaction is 100% =
clear and<BR>
Risk-Free,as I have made every necessary arrangements for a successful =
deal.The<BR>
only thing I solicit you is&nbsp; total assistance to transfer this =
money, complete<BR>
trust and<BR>
assurance that my&nbsp; own part of money will be safe when transferred =
to your<BR>
account. Kindly,keep&nbsp; this business proposal highly confidential =
for security<BR>
reasons.<BR>
If you are interested in assisting me,send reply via the above email =
address<BR>
and include your private phone and fax numbers. I will respond to you =
immediately.<BR>
<BR>
Looking forward to your urgent reply, God Bless.<BR>
sincerely yours,<BR>
<BR>
MRS.Racheal K. Albert (For The Family)<BR>
