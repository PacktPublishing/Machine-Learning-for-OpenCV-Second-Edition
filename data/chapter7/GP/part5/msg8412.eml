The fund (US$423M) in question was approved by the Government of Russia =
for<BR>
payment of various YUKOS OIL contractors/suppliers to prevent them =
from<BR>
loosing the money they invested in the numerous contracts they executed =
for<BR>
the above firm.<BR>
The Government had already concluded plans to freeze all the accounts in =
my<BR>
boss name (Mikhail Khodorkovsky) both corporate and personal and have on =
the<BR>
18th of October 2004 decided to sell off the assets of all Yukos Oil<BR>
corporation at a give-away amount to pay the allege taxes which the =
company<BR>
owed the Russian Government.refer to the website again.<BR>
Everybody in the world know that this is a political vendetta to ensure =
that<BR>
Mikhail Khodorkovsky comes out of detention as poor and broken man and =
his<BR>
companiesare liquidated, that if he is not eventually sent to jail for =
tax<BR>
evasion.<BR>
The Accountant General of YUKOS OIL (who is also my partner in this<BR>
transaction) and I have decided to raise a memo stating that YUKOS OIL =
owe<BR>
contractors the above amount which was finally approved for payment =
after<BR>
some deliberations. Actually, we have paid all our contractors both =
local<BR>
and foreign because they agitated for their payments when they heared =
that<BR>
my boss was arrested and might eventually be jailed by the<BR>
RussianGovernment.<BR>
YOUR ROLE:<BR>
I will present you/your company as one of the contractors we are owing =
so<BR>
that you can stand as the beneficiary of the above quoted sum or part of =
the<BR>
fund according to your financial strength or the strength of your =
company. I<BR>
will arrange for the documentation which the payee bank will need to<BR>
transfer the sum to you. The transaction has to be concluded before as =
soon<BR>
as possible. You will be rewarded with 10% of the total sum for your<BR>
partnership. Can you be my partner on this?<BR>
If this proposal is acceptable to you, Please send me your direct =
and<BR>
private, telephone and fax number and email address to enable me furnish =
you<BR>
with more information as we intend to conclude the transfer within =
14<BR>
working days.<BR>
