Know that although the cat has the advantage of quickness and lack =
of<BR>
concern for human life, you have the advantage of strength. Capitalize =
on<BR>
that advantage by selecting the battlefield. Don't try to bathe him in =
an<BR>
open area where he can force you to chase him. Pick a very small =
bathroom.<BR>
If your bathroom is more than four feet square, I recommend that you get =
in<BR>
the tub with the cat and close the sliding-glass doors as if you were =
about<BR>
to take a shower. (A simple shower curtain will not do. A berserk cat =
can<BR>
shred a three-ply rubber shower curtain quicker than a politician can =
shift<BR>
positions.)<BR>
If we were to start judging a man by his words and actions, what would =
be<BR>
the outcome? For me, the outcome would be sweet. I wouldn!/t feel<BR>
disappointed or used, less na?ve, and more respected. I can say that =
every<BR>
time I!/ve valued only the words I heard was the times that I was let =
down.<BR>
