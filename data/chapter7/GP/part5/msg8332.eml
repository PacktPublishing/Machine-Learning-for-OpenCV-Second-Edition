<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>MR.PEDRO THOMPSON GREGORIO<BR>
SANTA CLARA,<BR>
HAVANA, CUBA.<BR>
<BR>
AMIGO QUERIDO,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
My Name is PEDRO THOMPSON GREGORIO,<BR>
and I am writing you from my home in Santa Clara, about 165 miles east =
of<BR>
Havana,the Capital City of Cuba. Santa Clara is known for two =
landmarks;<BR>
The famous Revolutionary, the Guevera is buried here; and it is home =
to<BR>
one of Cuba's largest universities, La Universidad Central &quot;Martha =
Abreu&quot;<BR>
de Las Villas.<BR>
<BR>
This is a compelling story, and I beg you to be patient and read =
through<BR>
to the end! I was adopted in 1960, at age 14 months by Mr. MORRIS =
THOMPSON,<BR>
A MULTI-MILLIONAIRE OF FAIRBANKS, ALASKA,U.S.A .<BR>
<BR>
My adoption brought so much controversy that Mr. MORRIS was forced by =
his<BR>
family to put me into a foster home IN CUBA at age 5,where I stayed =
until<BR>
maturity; Like most Cuban youths, I dreamt of freedom, which every one =
here<BR>
knows is called 'America'; like most youths, in time, I joined an =
Anti-Castro<BR>
group and that merited automatic 24 hours round the clock surveillance =
by<BR>
the Secret Police, but this is also normal in Cuba! My father =
nevertheless<BR>
funded my education through the above mentioned university,where I =
graduated<BR>
in Automobile Engineering. I am now a mechanic, making just enough to =
take<BR>
care of my wife Isabel, and 3 boys, Junior, Denis, and woodison.<BR>
<BR>
Sadly, My father died in JANUARY, 31,2000; HE, HIS WIFE, THELMA AND =
ONLY<BR>
DAUGHTER,SHERYL WERE AMONG THE 83 PASSENGERS [INCLUDING 5 CREW =
MEMBERS]<BR>
ON BOARD THE ALASKA AIRLINE FLIGHT 261 HEADING TO SAN FRANCISCO AND =
SEATLE<BR>
FROM PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO BUT CRASHED INTO THE PACIFIC OCEAN NOT =
FAR<BR>
FROM LOS ANGELES.YOU CAN FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THIS PLANE CRASH FROM =
:http//www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/05/alaska.airlines.03/<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
we mourn him deeply;I had no memory of my real father; but I loved him =
for<BR>
his kindness to me; he frequently defied his family to visit me?<BR>
When I got married, he gave my wife a ring as a present which we later =
found<BR>
out was a diamond ring!<BR>
<BR>
His Last Will and testament was read and probated, am told. He only =
mentioned<BR>
in his will that he had deposited a trunk box for me and my family =
containing<BR>
six million United States Dollars in a Finance Security company. He =
did<BR>
say in his will, am told by one of his friends,now late[ma his soul =
rest<BR>
in perfect peace], that The Finance Company which he said is in Europe =
does<BR>
not know the content of this sealed trunk box of money. I was told =
that<BR>
it was declared as PERSONAL ITEMS.This has bewildered me as I have no =
way<BR>
of knowing the name of this company and /or its location in Europe. =
Though<BR>
,I guess he did not mentioned the name and the exact location for =
security<BR>
reasons.I CONTINUED WITH MY LIFE THINKING THAT IT WAS ALL LIES.<BR>
<BR>
Some weeks ago, I received a letter from A FINANCE AND SECURITY =
COMPANY<BR>
in Europe,a PLACE he frquently visited, from a Commission Agent, and =
the<BR>
contents of that letter put me into shock! I kept the letter for a =
week<BR>
without mentioning it to my wife.<BR>
<BR>
Eventually I revealed everything to her .Apparently, My late =
father,Mr.<BR>
Morris had provided for us truly after all! Mr.Thompson had deposited =
a<BR>
trunk box for us!! in a FINANCE and SECURITY COMPANY in 1999, a year =
before<BR>
he died and left it in my name;The letter explained that according to =
the<BR>
terms and agreement reached with my late father, THIS TRUNK BOX, was =
to<BR>
be delivered to me.(The Beneficiary) upon his death ; The Director of =
Operation<BR>
of the Company, in his letter apologized to me for waiting so long to =
contact<BR>
me; information of my whereabout did not reach him on time, especially =
with<BR>
the Cuban Authorities swearing it must prosecute me for =
anti-government<BR>
activities, until last two weeks ago.<BR>
<BR>
I am now invited to come forward to EUROPE, to claim my Inheritance! =
But<BR>
this simple invitation to travel to Europe is fraught with problems! I =
have<BR>
no International Passport! It is impossible to travel out of =
Cuba,unless<BR>
with special permission which will of course take months of paperwork =
to<BR>
procure?As an Anti-Castro sympathizer,I have absolutely no hope of =
leaving<BR>
Cuba legally?The only option is to leave by illegal ferry to the =
American<BR>
Coast of Miami, which is extremely dangerous?Every one knows that =
success<BR>
rate is about 30%, the unlucky get captured and repatriated back to =
prison.<BR>
But the rich and the connected have a better chance by using low =
flying<BR>
aircraft ( which will beat the Cuban Radar) to smuggle themselves =
out.<BR>
<BR>
I, therefore, desperately need your help! I need you to contact the =
FINANCE<BR>
AND SECURITY COMPANY in EUROPE on my behalf ; secure the TRUNK BOX, =
containing<BR>
the FUNDS from the COMPANY, and deposit the money into your Bank =
Account.You<BR>
must NEVER LET THE FINANCE COMPANY KNOW THE CONTENT OF THE TRUNK BOX. =
Once<BR>
the money is secured, I will make the usual underground deal to be =
smuggled<BR>
out of Cuba by aircraft, to freedom! There is absolutely NO RISK to =
you<BR>
in this transaction; I and my family are the ones at risk... =
Therefore,<BR>
I will make no attempt to call you by land based telephone,which is =
routinely<BR>
bugged and monitored by the Secret Police.<BR>
In consideration of your expenses during the course of this =
transaction,<BR>
I freely offer you 10% of the principal sum,If you are willing to help =
me<BR>
recover my inheritance. Please so indicate in your return reply mail =
and<BR>
I will follow up with more details of the<BR>
COMPANY'S contact address and and TELEPHONE NUMBERS,and also more =
details<BR>
of the transaction.<BR>
SEND YOUR REPLY TO pedrogregorio@outgun.com<BR>
Looking forward to your urgent reply.<BR>
EL DIOS LE BENDICE<BR>
Sincerely,<BR>
Mr Pedro THOMPSON Gregorio<BR>
