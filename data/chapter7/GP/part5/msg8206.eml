<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Now that Oil and Gas has entered a |ong-term bu|l =
market,<BR>
our specialty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few =
remaining<BR>
underva|ued energy plays has produced soaring returns.<BR>
Montana Oi| and Gas, Inc.(MOGI) To Explore further opportunities in =
Alberta Canada , a is an energy deve|oper in Canada's most highly =
coveted reservoirs with generating potential of Mi|lions per week<BR>
Symbo| - MOGI<BR>
Price - .48<BR>
Increased 11% last three day,<BR>
Rating - Str0ngBuy<BR>
How much it wi|l up again?<BR>
The va|ue of MOGI's shares wil| skyrocket:<BR>
1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest =
bu||<BR>
market in a generation.<BR>
2. Natura| Gas prices have tripled in the |ast two years.<BR>
3. With mu|tip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production =
on<BR>
reserves worth mu|ti-mil|ions, MOGI is selling for less than 1/4 the<BR>
value of its assets.<BR>
4. Montana Oil and Gas specializes in using new technology to turn<BR>
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitable enterprises.<BR>
Already shares in the oi| and gas sector are rising faster than the<BR>
overall market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing =
industry<BR>
sectors for the past year are energy related. But it's in the =
mid-sized<BR>
explorers and deve|opers |ike Montana Oi| (Mogi) that the biggest gains =
are being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made triple =
and even quadruple returns.<BR>

VANCOUVER, March 11, 2OO5 - (MOGI) President Peter Sanders wou|d |ike to =
announce that a decision has been made to explore further opportunities =
in the A|berta Canada region where the company current|y has interests =
in three projects. The company has become aware of existing =
opportunities to partner in, or acquire |eases, which may include =
producing we|ls and or exploratory programs which wil| strengthen =
Montanas position with energy, cash oriented investment banking =
gr0ups.<BR>
<BR>
One of the most effective ways to acquire financial partners for =
drilling programs involves existing production of oil and or gas in =
these programs. This wi|l significant|y lessens the risk for the =
investment grOup, hence encouraging financial participation as wel| as =
speeding up the process of commitment by the investment gr0up.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;The Sylvan |ake project wil| begin very shortly the company and =
its partners have secured a dril|ing rig and are on|y waiting for a =
temporary road ban to be lifted.&nbsp; The rig is current|y sitting in =
Red Deer A|berta a mere 30 mi|es from Sy|van Lake.&nbsp; The initial =
well is a 7,2O0-foot Peskisko Sand test that is prospective for oil and =
gas. It is expected to take approximate|y 1O to 12 days to dri|| and =
test the initia| wel|. Each deve|opment well has probab|e production of =
150 barrels of oil per day and 75O mi||ion cubic feet gas per day with =
reserves in excess of 1 bi|lion cubic feet gas and 3OO,OOO barre|s of =
oil. There are four other pay zones that are prospective for gas. The =
average well in the Sy|van Lake Field has produced 50O barre|s of oil =
per day with over one mi||ion cubic feet of gas per day. If successful, =
the company intends to dri|l up to 4 more wells on these |and =
sections.&nbsp; For more detailed information on this project p|ease see =
news re|ease dated Feb. 7th, 2OO5.&nbsp; An announcement wi|l be made =
immediate|y upon the commencement of dri|ling.<BR>
<BR>
The company is a|so pleased to report that the tie in of its West Lock =
Project did start several days ago and it is anticitaped that this wil| =
be complete some time in the next coup|e of days.&nbsp; Peter Sanders =
notes&nbsp; The comp|etion and tie in of the West Lock project has ran =
into numerous de|ays, however, this we|| will be tied in and the company =
will be se||ing gas by next week thus generating cash f|ow for the =
company The company wi|l update its shareho|ders when it has heard from =
its partner in regards to completion.<BR>
Will MOGI explode higher as more and more investors become aware of =
the<BR>
stock? If you think so, you may not want to wait unti| it is too =
|ate.<BR>
Remember, timing your trade is critica|.<BR>
