FROM DESK OF :DR.FRED OBINNA<BR>
Lagos-Nigeria.<BR>
RC.27199.<BR>
<BR>
Attn:MD/C.E.O<BR>
<BR>
Dear Sir,<BR>
<BR>
STRICTLY A PRIVATE BUSINESS PROPOSAL<BR>
<BR>
I am Dr.Fred Obinna, The manager, Bills and Exchange at the =
Foreign&nbsp;<BR>
Remittance Department of African Development Bank of Nigeria&nbsp; PLC =
(A.D.B) I&nbsp;<BR>
am writing this letter to ask for your support and cooperation to carry =
out&nbsp;<BR>
this business opportunity in my department. We discovered an abandoned =
sum&nbsp;<BR>
of $15,000,000M US DOLLARS (15 million United States Dollars only) in =
an&nbsp;<BR>
account that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died along with =
his<BR>
&nbsp; entire family of a wife and two children in November 2001 in a =
Plane&nbsp;<BR>
crash.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; Since we heard of his death, we have been expecting his =
next-of-kin to<BR>
come&nbsp; over and put claims for his money as the heir, because we =
cannot<BR>
release the&nbsp; fund from his account unless someone applies for claim =
as the<BR>
next-of-kin to&nbsp; the deceased as indicated in our banking =
guidelines.<BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, neither their family member nor distant relative has =
ever&nbsp;<BR>
appeared to claim the said fund. Upon this discovery, I and other =
officials&nbsp;<BR>
in my department have agreed to make business with you and release the =
total<BR>
&nbsp; amount into your account&nbsp; since no one has came for it or =
discovered he&nbsp;<BR>
maintained account with our bank, otherwise the fund will be returned to =
the<BR>
&nbsp; banks treasury as unclaimed fund.<BR>
<BR>
We have agreed that our ratio of sharing will be as stated thus;<BR>
<BR>
20 % for you as foreign partner, 75 % for us the officials in my =
department&nbsp;<BR>
and 5 % for the settlement of all local and foreign expences incurred by =
us&nbsp;<BR>
and you during the course of this business.<BR>
<BR>
Upon the successful completion of this transfer, I and one of my =
colleagues<BR>
will come to your country and mind our share. It is from our 75 % we =
intend&nbsp;<BR>
to import Agricultural Machineries into my country as a way of recycling =
the<BR>
&nbsp; fund.<BR>
<BR>
To commence this transaction, we require you to immediately indicate =
your&nbsp;<BR>
interest by a return e-mail&nbsp; and enclose your private contact =
telephone&nbsp;<BR>
number, fax number full name and address and your designated =
bank&nbsp;<BR>
coordinates to enable us file letter of claim to the appropriate<BR>
departments for necessary approvals before the transfer can be made.<BR>
<BR>
Note also, this transaction must be kept STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL because =
of&nbsp;<BR>
its nature.<BR>
<BR>
I look forward to receiving your prompt response.<BR>
<BR>
