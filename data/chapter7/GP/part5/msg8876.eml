The routines of tourism are even more monotonous than those of daily =
life.<BR><BR>Faith is a continuation of reason.

Business is never so healthy as when, like a chicken, it must do a =
certain amount of scratching around for what it gets.



<BR><BR>Your friend is your field which you sow with love and reap with =
thanksgiving.We are in danger of making our cities places where business =
goes on but where life, in its real sense, is lost.
The primary use of conversation is to satisfy the impulse to talk.

<br>We only part to meet again.

Forgive him, for he believes that the customs of his tribe are the laws =
of nature!<br><br>Every life is its own excuse for being.<BR><BR>Nobody =
can be as agreeable as an uninvited guest.A well-aimed spear is worth =
three.
<br>Self-respect is the root of discipline the sense of dignity grows =
with the ability to say no to oneself.


<br>Past failures are guideposts to success.

<br><br>The hangover became a part of the day as well allowed-for as the =
Spanish siesta.To different minds, the same world is a hell, and a =
heaven.
There never will exist anything permanently noble and excellent in the =
character which is a stranger to resolute self-denial.
<BR>The more anger towards the past you carry in your heart, the less =
capable you are of loving in the present.



<BR><BR>I believe we are on an irreversible trend toward more freedom =
and democracy -- but that could change.
