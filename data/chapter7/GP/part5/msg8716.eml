<br><br>A friend is one who knows us, but loves us anyway.
<BR>He was exhaled his great Creator drew His spirit, as the sun the =
morning dew.



<BR><BR>The right honorable gentlemen is indebted to his memory for his =
jokes and his imagination for his facts.<BR>All growth depends upon =
activity. There is no development physically or intellectually without =
effort, and effort means work.<BR>There is no instinct like that of the =
heart.<BR>Memory moderates prosperity, decreases adversity, controls =
youth and delights old age.<BR><BR>Nothing retains less of desire in =
art, in science, than this will to industry, booty, possession.<br>The =
man who removes a mountain begins by carrying away small stones.

We only love truly once. It is the first time and succeeding passions =
are less uncontrolled.



<BR>The ultimate sin of any performer is contempt for the audience.To =
become a thoroughly good man is the best prescription for keeping a =
sound mind and a sound body.



<br>A part of kindness consists in loving people more than they deserve.

Public sentiment is everything, without it nothing can fail, without it =
nothing can succeed.
<BR><BR>You can tell the ideals of a nation by its =
advertisements.<BR><BR>Writing and travel broaden your ass if not your =
mind and I like to write standing up.


Discipline is not a nasty word.



<br><br>One must think like a hero to behave like a merely decent human =
being.

<br>We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the =
stars.=0D
