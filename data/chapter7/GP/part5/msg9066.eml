American Resource Management, Inc., through its wholly-owned subsidiary, =
Efficiency Technologies, Inc. ("EffTec") is a Tulsa, Oklahoma based =
company dedicated to developing energy efficiency monitoring programs =
for commercial/industrial HVAC systems principally made up of =
centrifugal chillers and boilers.  Centrifugal chillers are the single =
largest energy-using components in most facilities and can typically =
consume more than 50% of the total electrical usage.  Centrifugal =
chillers running inefficiently result in substantially higher energy =
costs, decreased equipment reliability and shortened lifespan.<p>

EffTec has developed a powerful, easy-to-use, online diagnostic service =
called EffHVAC that gives facilities the ability to document, monitor, =
evaluate and manage centrifugal chiller system performance.  EffHVAC =
created detailed reports that contain a wealth of information that can =
be used to improve operations and save th0usands of dollars in utility =
costs.<p>
