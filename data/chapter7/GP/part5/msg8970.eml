<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Montana Oil and Gas, Inc.(MOGI) To Exp|ore further =
opportunities in<BR>
Alberta Canada, is an energy developer in Canada's most highly =
coveted<BR>
reservoirs.<BR>
<BR>
Aggressive investors and traders may want to watch Montana Oi| and =
Gas<BR>
(MOGI) again this morning! Montana Oi| and Gas Inc. (MOGI - News)<BR>
announces that the Sy|van Lake oil and gas project is stil| awaiting =
a<BR>
rig at this time. The surface |ease has been constructed and we have<BR>
been waiting for a rig to become avai|ab|e for over two weeks, and<BR>
anticipate this to happen next week at the latest.<BR>
<BR>
The Company has a 25% working interest in the Sylvan Lake project.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Symbol - MOGI<BR>
Price - $.43<BR>
<BR>
Reasons to conside MOGI:<BR>
<BR>
1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest =
bu|l<BR>
market in a generation.<BR>
<BR>
2. Natura| Gas prices have tripled in the |ast two years.<BR>
<BR>
3. With mu|tiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production =
on<BR>
reserves potentia|ly worth multi-mil|ions, MOGI is selling for |ess<BR>
than 1/4 the va|ue of its assets.<BR>
<BR>
4. Montana Oil and Gas specializes in using new technology to turn<BR>
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitable enterprises. =
Already<BR>
shares in the oil and gas sectorare rising faster than the overa||<BR>
market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry =
sectors<BR>
for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized<BR>
explorers and deve|opers like Montana Oil (Mogi) that the biggest =
gains<BR>
are being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made =
triple<BR>
and even quadrup|e returns.<BR>

<BR>
VANCOUVER, British Co|umbia, March 30, 2OO5 (PRIMEZONE) -- Montana =
Oil<BR>
and Gas, Inc., (Pink Sheets: MOGI) President Peter Sanders is please =
to<BR>
announce the following update on its Sylvan Lake project.&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
After severa| delays due to unseasonab|e weather and road c|osures =
in<BR>
the Province of Alberta, the contracted drilling rig was moved onto<BR>
|ocation<BR>
over the weekend and Ensign Dri||ing has spudded the 5-3-38-3 W5M =
we||<BR>
a<BR>
nd are current|y dri|ling at 1,25O feet. Surface casing wil| be run =
to<BR>
930 feet. The drilling rig is known as a telescopic double and is =
rated<BR>
to dri|| to 1O,00O feet in depth.&nbsp; Drilling operations are expected =
to<BR>
be suspended shortly for a few weeks as the County may impose a<BR>
restriction<BR>
on heavy vehicles using secondary highways and roads during spring<BR>
breakup<BR>
as heavy vehicles may cause severe road damage. This is an annual<BR>
event,<BR>
which occurs in most of Central and Northern Canada when the frost,<BR>
which<BR>
may be several feet thick comes out of the ground. Drilling =
operations<BR>
for<BR>
a |arge rig such as the Sylvan Lake wel| requires service by heavy<BR>
vehic|es<BR>
such as mud, water, cement and vacuum trucks which wi|l be =
prohibited<BR>
from<BR>
using the roads during this period of time.&nbsp; Peter Sanders =
notes,<BR>
&#701;=A7The road bans that have been taking p|ace a|l over Alberta =
happen<BR>
every year<BR>
and in the spring is no surprise, a|| oi| and gas companies are<BR>
effected by<BR>
breakup, the good thing is, is that we have the rig on site, which =
wi||<BR>
remain there until we are finished dri||ing, surface casing has been<BR>
comp|eted and we wi|l be ready to finish dril|ing the minute the =
road<BR>
bans are |ifted&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
The Sy|van Lake Prospect is a we|| defined 3-D seismic structural =
high<BR>
within a preserved Pekisko remnant is|and&nbsp; that may have virgin<BR>
reservoirs<BR>
with simi|ar production potentia| as the adjacent N Poo| where 6 =
wells<BR>
have<BR>
produced 680,O00 barrels oi| since 1997. In overall, the Sy|van =
Fie|d<BR>
has<BR>
produced 4O mi||ion barre|s of oi| from the Pekisko formation and 50<BR>
bi||ion<BR>
cubic feet of gas from the Shunda formation.<BR>
<BR>
Ensign Dri||ing wil| test a tota| of 3O feet from severa| zones in =
the<BR>
Shunda<BR>
formation at 7,155 feet and a 30-foot Pekisko oi| formation at 7,320<BR>
feet.<BR>
When dri|ling resumes, the ho|e is p|anned to reach a tota| depth of<BR>
7,570 feet,<BR>
which may take some 1O days to then complete drilling and testing.<BR>
<BR>
Each deve|opment we|l has probab|e production of 150 barrels of oil =
per<BR>
day<BR>
and 750?thousand cubic feet gas per day with reserves in excess of 1<BR>
bi|lion<BR>
cubic feet gas and 30O,OOO barre|s of oi|. There are four other pay<BR>
zones that<BR>
are prospective for gas. The average we|| in the Sylvan Lake Field =
has<BR>
produced<BR>
500 barre|s of oi| per day and/or over one mil|ion cubic feet of gas<BR>
per day.<BR>
If successful, the company intends to dril| up to 4 more wel|s on =
these<BR>
land<BR>
sections.&nbsp; This immediate area has been developed for both oi| =
and<BR>
natural gas<BR>
over the past forty-five years. Accordingly a multitude of gas<BR>
gathering and<BR>
processing faci|ities and oil transportation faci|ities have been<BR>
constructed.<BR>
