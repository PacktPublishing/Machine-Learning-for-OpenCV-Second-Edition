Victory goes to the player who makes the next-to-last mistake. - =
Chessmaster Savielly Grigorievitch Tartakower (1887-1956) &nbsp<br> If =
you cant get rid of the skeleton in your closet youd best teach it to =
dance. - George Bernard Shaw (1856-1950) &nbsp<br> One of the symptoms =
of an approaching nervous breakdown is the belief that ones work is =
terribly important. - Bertrand Russell (1872-1970)
