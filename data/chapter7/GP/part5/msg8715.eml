<BR><BR>We who are liberal and progressive know that the poor are our =
equals in every sense except that of being equal to us.


<BR>The beautiful uncut hair of graves.



<BR>Oh, that one could learn to learn in time!



<BR>The only prudence in life is concentration.



<br><br>Luxury ruins republics poverty, monarchies.
<br>If you continually give, you will continually have.


<br>Liberty consists in wholesome restraint.<BR>There is no knowledge, =
no light, no wisdom that you are in possession of, but what you have =
received it from some source.



<br>Loans and debts make worry and frets.

True glory lies in noble deeds.Get your facts first, and then you can =
distort them as much as you please.<br>Men argue, nature acts.



Life is divided up into the horrible and the miserable.



An empty house is like a stray dog or a body from which life has =
departed.I always have to dream up there against the stars. If I don't =
dream I will make it, I won't even get close.<BR><BR>Curious things, =
habits. People themselves never knew they had them.<br>Fear of change =
perplexes monarchs.<br>Common Sense is that which judges the things =
given to it by other senses.<BR><BR><A =
