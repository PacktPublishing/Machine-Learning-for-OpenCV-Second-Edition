Nearer and nearer they came, while Rob watched them and bemoaned the<BR>
foolish impulse that had led him to fall asleep in an unknown land where =
he<BR>
could so easily be overpowered and robbed of his treasures. I always<BR>
suspected these electrical inventions would be my ruin some day, he<BR>
reflected, sadly; and now I'm side-tracked and left helpless in this<BR>
outlandish country, without a single hope of ever getting home again<BR>
They probably won't be able to kill me, unless they find my Garment =
of<BR>
Repulsion and strip that off; but I never could cross this terrible =
desert<BR>
on foot and, having lost my food tablets, I'd soon starve if I attempted =
it<BR>
