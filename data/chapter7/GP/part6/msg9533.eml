Dear Sir/Madam,<BR>
<BR>
I am Dr. J. Goodman; it is my great pleasure to write you this letter on =
behalf of my colleagues. Your information was given to me by a member of =
the Economic Society of South Africa and Chamber of Trade Commerce =
(ESSACTC) who was with the Government delegation on a trip to your =
country for a bilateral conference talk to encourage foreign investors. =
I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the =
execution of the deal hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope =
you will keep it confidential because of the nature of this =
business.<BR>
<BR>
Within the Department of Minerals &amp; Energy where I work as a =
Director of Audit and Project Implementation and with the co-operation =
of four other top officials, we have in our possession an overdue =
payment in US funds.<BR>
<BR>
The said funds represent certain percentage of the total contract value =
executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which =
we the officials over-invoiced to the amount of Fourteen Million Two =
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars (US$ 14.2 Million). Though the =
actual contract cost has been paid to the original contractor, leaving =
the excess balance unclaimed.<BR>
<BR>
Since the present elected Government is determined to pay foreign =
contractors all debts owed, so as to maintain good relationship with =
foreign governments and non-government agencies, we included our bills =
for approvals with the Department of Finance and the Contract Review and =
Payment Implementation Committee (CRPIC). We are seeking your assistance =
to front as beneficiary of the unclaimed funds, since we are not allowed =
to operate foreign accounts. Details and change of beneficiary =
information upon application for claim to reflect payment and approvals =
will be secured on behalf of You/your Company.<BR>
<BR>
I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you =
be willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will =
be 20% of the $14.2 million, 70% for us and 10% for taxation and =
miscellaneous expenses.<BR>
<BR>
The business is completely safe and secure, provided you treat it with =
utmost confidentiality.&nbsp; It does not matter whether you/your =
Company does contract projects, as a transfer of powers will be secured =
in favor of you/your Company. Also, your area of specialization is not a =
hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction. I have =
reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint =
us.<BR>
<BR>
Kindly notify me by telephone on Direct Tel No.: 011 871-762-535915, Fax =
No.:011 871-762-535916 for further details upon your acceptance of this =
proposal.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks for your co-operation.<BR>
<BR>
Regards,<BR>
<BR>
DR. JOHN GOODMAN<BR>
