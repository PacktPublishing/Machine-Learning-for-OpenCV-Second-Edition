<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>A unique offer, time to climb the ladder!<BR>
<BR>
Would You Rather Have<BR>
Financial independence or Time Freedom?<BR>
<BR>
How about both?<BR>
<BR>
Everyday People Living Extraordinary Lives Their Very First Year!<BR>
Your success will be achieved with personal mentoring by a group of<BR>
individuals that have already achieved a multiple six-figure income. =
The<BR>
system that is in place works perfectly. If you have a burning desire =
for a<BR>
multiple six figure income along with the time to spend it, YOU have =
come to<BR>
the RIGHT place. ANYONE that is coachable and trainable will succeed. =
This<BR>
opportunity requires no personal selling or explaining. Here are just a =
few<BR>
of YOUR benefits.<BR>
--<BR>
1. Your FREEDOM<BR>
2. Your financial independence<BR>
3. Unparalleled training and support<BR>
4. More time with your family<BR>
5. Total time flexibility<BR>
6. Work at your own place<BR>
7. Your SECURITY<BR>
8. Your earnings determined by YOU<BR>
9. No one giving you orders<BR>
10. No commutes<BR>
11. No more making others rich<BR>
12. No boss looking over your shoulder<BR>

<BR>
Earnings Potential<BR>
<BR>
This has the potential of being a six to seven-figure opportunity that =
is<BR>
designed for anyone to operate. You can make $1,000 per sale and have =
add-on<BR>
sales that bring $5,000 and $8,000, with no additional work. All that =
is<BR>
required of you is to duplicate what we have already done and you will =
be<BR>
shown every step of the way. People from all walks of life are =
experiencing<BR>
exceptional results. Ordinary people become extraordinary in a matter =
of<BR>
weeks!<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Fast Cash More Personal Time<BR>
<BR>
Unlike &quot;traditional&quot; businesses such as franchises costing =
$50,000 to<BR>
$500,000 with unstable income and requiring work levels of 60-80 hours =
a<BR>
week, this business has the potential of generating results =
quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp; You<BR>
will be provided the names of many successful leaders that will gladly =
share<BR>
their expertise so that YOU can be successful. You will not be relying =
on<BR>
just one individual - our entire team is dedicated to your success.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; For those who are ready to start today you will be shown how =
to<BR>
potentially make money this WEEK! If you can follow simple directions, =
then<BR>
you will do very well using the simple system of this business.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Unparalleled Training<BR>
<BR>
Why depend on just one person for your training? With our team you will =
be<BR>
coached and individually assisted by a whole team of experts. There =
are<BR>
trainers who have had six figure MONTHS! And so can YOU! They will =
gladly<BR>
share with you their secrets.<BR>
The reason ANYONE can be successful is because of the system. The =
system<BR>
takes care of EVERYTHING. The entire company was designed from the =
ground up<BR>
to be able to have someone with only minimal education have massive =
success.<BR>
Small businesses and people fail 90% of the time but systems work =
every<BR>
time. Add a compensation plan that is unparalleled to that equation and =
what<BR>
you get is a simple system that can give YOU enormous earnings =
potential.<BR>
You will receive unparalleled training and support. It is worth =
repeating<BR>
here. The system was designed from the ground up to be able to allow =
anyone<BR>
to learn the business. All you need is the drive and a stick-to-it =
attitude.<BR>
Everything else is in place.<BR>
Frequently Asked Questions<BR>
Q: Is this M L M (Multi-Level Marketing)?<BR>
A: No it is not. M L M is a great concept but it lacks a system that<BR>
provides individual support. Also, realistically it takes 1-5 years =
to<BR>
achieve huge success in an M L M. Our system is designed for you to =
achieve<BR>
success in a shorter period - almost from the first week of working =
your<BR>
business.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Q: Do I have to talk to people in this business?<BR>
A: Yes, you have to talk to people but only simple conversation skills =
are<BR>
required. We do no telling, selling, or explaining of any product, nor =
do we<BR>
try to convince anyone to buy our products.<BR>
<BR>
Q: Are there other costs involved in running this business?<BR>
A: No. Anyone who tells you that it does take money to build a business =
is<BR>
lying to you. This is a business that generates a substantial income =
and<BR>
does not require initial investments.<BR>
<BR>
Q:&nbsp; On a scale of 1-10 what is the difficulty level of running =
this<BR>
business?<BR>
A: With 10 being the most difficult and 1 being the simplest, out of =
all<BR>
the businesses, I would say for most everyone, it will be a 1 if they =
are<BR>
coachable and trainable and follow our simple system.<BR>
<BR>
The System for Your Success<BR>
<BR>
Your Action=3DYour Success!<BR>
<BR>
Winners Take Action!<BR>
WINNERS make decisions and take action. . .<BR>
when they see an opportunity. They also follow the examples of other<BR>
successful people because it's much more efficient than learning the =
hard<BR>
way. Winners don't make excuses and they never procrastinate. Losers =
will<BR>
procrastinate or study a problem endlessly to make sure they don't =
do<BR>
anything &quot;rash&quot;. You can either decide to leave my ad without =
responding or<BR>
you can call now and get started immediately in one of the most =
exciting<BR>
businesses available today.<BR>
<BR>
Lame Excuse #1<BR>
&quot;I'm not sure I want to invest my money to start a business when I =
have<BR>
seen some that I can start for free.&quot;<BR>
If you want a 'job' with startup costs, you're on the wrong place.<BR>
<BR>
Lame Excuse #2<BR>
&quot;I don't have enough time to operate &amp; promote a Home =
Business.&quot;<BR>
Do you have 15-25 hours a week to obtain the lifestyle you deserve?<BR>
Countless people from all walks of life, regardless of education or<BR>
background, are running successful businesses from home setting their =
own<BR>
hours and making fortunes by following a simple marketing system that =
allows<BR>
financial, personal, and time freedom to live the life they deserve.<BR>
<BR>
Lame Excuse #3<BR>
&quot;I've tried other businesses that sound similar to this, so I don't =
think I<BR>
am going to call.&quot;<BR>
Colonel Sanders tried to sell the idea of Kentucky Fried Chicken 1700 =
times<BR>
before someone bought into the idea. What if he had thought the same as =
you<BR>
and given up after the 10th time, or worse, given up on the 1699th =
try.<BR>
Persistence and belief in yourself is the key to success.<BR>
<BR>
The lessons learned from past failures increase your chance for success =
the<BR>
next time. Walking away from this opportunity is giving up, plain =
and<BR>
simple. Successful people NEVER quit or give up on themselves!!<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The true definition of insanity is doing the same things and =
expecting<BR>
different results.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
A c t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; N o w!<BR>
<BR>
This business requires a small time commitment for making mega =
wealth.<BR>
Here, you can make the money and actually have the time to spend it!<BR>
