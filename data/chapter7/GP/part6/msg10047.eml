<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Are you tired of Public Companies without anything =
substantial backing their story - how about a revolutionary invention =
that will change the Security industry forever, and the company just =
went public!!!<BR>
<BR>
Company Name: snif fex inc<BR>
Ticker: SN FX<BR>
<BR>
Rating: Strong Buy<BR>
<BR>
industry: Security, Homeland Security, Cargo Screening and EDS<BR>
<BR>
Reason for the TOP 2005 Rating: Unique Exp losive Detection Device =
Capable of finding its targets from tens or hundreds of meters!!! There =
is no other EDS device which is so powerfull that can locate almost any =
explosve behind concrete walls from distance of tens of meters!!<BR>
<BR>
The Competition: There are many companies in the industry of Sniffing =
exp losives, some of them are public and they are companies like iSON =
HWPR or HiET and all of them have devices which can locate exp losive =
from 10 inches, 1 feet, 2 feet or close to that. Compared to these =
results SN FX device is tens of times better and smaller in size and yet =
CHEAPER!!<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;SN FX announced the release of snif fex Version 1.1, a handheld =
exp losives detection device which the Company claims can locate =
nitro-based exp losives from a distance of 10 to 100 feet depending on =
the quantity of the exp losive and environmental conditions. The Company =
also stated that, to the best of their knowledge, snif fex is the first =
device of its kind that can operate from such distances and find exp =
losives behind barriers.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Could this company be amongst the top deals on wallstreet this year!!! =
YES its trading at only 75 cents now and this brand new stock could be =
$3-4 easily in the next few weeks as the story unfolds!!<BR>
<BR>
SN FX is in process of presenting the new device in USA and to Worldwide =
Markets and as soon as they receive some substantial orders and feedback =
from big institutional clients, this stock will fly in the skies, as an =
example iSON traded almost 1 billion dollars after they announced they =
are in process of developing some device, and SN FX already has the =
device and it proved it works in numerous tests!!<BR>
<BR>

This stock is going to be the hottest issue for the summer!!<BR>
