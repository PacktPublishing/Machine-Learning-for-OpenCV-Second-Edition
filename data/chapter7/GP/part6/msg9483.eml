<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Dear Sir/Madam,<BR>
<BR>
Though in very high desperation, I am also very delighted to be writing =
this mail to you, which I believe you would keep between you and I to =
avoid a situation where I would be sought after.<BR>
<BR>
My names is Captain Anumou Yahk, a very trusted aid of late =
GNASINGMA<BR>
EYADEMA; former president of Togo, who died in office on his way to =
London for medical attention. His son has since assumed office as the =
new prident of the Republic of Togo.<BR>
<BR>
Prior to his untimely death, the late president instructed that collect =
some funds and diamonds from Liberia and Seirra Leone, where he had a =
very viable partnership going with the president of the two countries, =
running into a total of US$25,000:000:00 (Twenty Five Million United =
States Dollars),excluding the Gold and diamond. As usual, I would convey =
the package in cash through and deposit them in a vaulting company in =
Ghana, from where it would be moved to Europe, where he deposits the =
funds in his private bank account,and the diamond taken to Brussels for =
marketting. This transaction is known<BR>
only to the late president and I.<BR>
<BR>
I was on my way from Monrovia, in Liberia, when I got the news of the =
death of my former boss, the president, and being unsure of what to do, =
I deposited the trunk in the vaulting company, and proceeded to Lome, =
the capital of Togo, where&nbsp; I discovered it was true that he had =
died on his way to Europe.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I then decided to wait a while to know if anyone had knowledge of =
the<BR>
dealings, but till now, no one has mentioned anything of sort, which =
gave me the courage to write this to you, asking for your assistance to =
help claim the trunk on my behalf, as I cannot claim it myself for fear =
of traced.<BR>
<BR>
The Late president usually had a white french man go to Ghana to =
facilitate the movement of the trunk box out of Ghana and Africa as a =
whole.<BR>
<BR>
I am soliciting you assistance to help see this through, and While the =
money would be in your custody, you might be required to help invest it =
in any area, and have the accrued interest paid into a seperate trust =
account till I am able and ready to travel out when the heat dies down, =
and no eyebrows are raised.<BR>
<BR>
For your assistance, I would set aside&nbsp; 15% of the entire money for =
your assistance and help. By this, you would not be entitled to any part =
of the money invested after the 15%, but arrangements would be made to =
negotiate a percentage of the interest gotten from the investments as =
your remuneration as an investment broker. this would be discussed as =
soon as the money is in your custody. The diamond and gold would be kept =
in trust by you till I arrive in your country so we can arrange to =
market them.<BR>
<BR>
I would want&nbsp; you to get back to me without delay, as we have very =
limited time to conclude this considering the time span which the =
package usually leaves after the deposit. I would expect to hear from =
you within 48 hours,failure to which I would have to source for another =
contact to take up the offer. It is an assistance for me, but since the =
assistance is being remunerated, it is more of an offer, and we should =
be able to deal with absolute trust. I would expect you to send your fax =
numbers as well as your telephone numbers to me, so I can furnish you =
with the vaulting documents as soon as they are ready.<BR>
<BR>
I would be travelling&nbsp; to Ghana in a few days from now, since the =
crisis in Togo is highly unpredictable, from where I would be<BR>
till we get this done. I would send you a number you can reach me on =
while there as soon as I get your response.<BR>
<BR>
I wait to hear from you soonest.<BR>
<BR>
Best Regards<BR>
<BR>
VINCE ANUMOU YAHK<BR>
