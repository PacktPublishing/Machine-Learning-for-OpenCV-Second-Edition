Hello,<br>
My name is Alex Moore. I'm the manager in TIF Company.<br>
We have open vacancy for US and UK citizens.<br>
First, let me tell you about our company. We are providing financial<br>
services worldwide. We have several offices in Europe, and need =
transfer<br>
processing service in US and UK.<br>
Our position is called Financial Manager. It is very important position =
for<br>
us now. We need trustable and honest people working with us like =
partners.<br>
We have different tasks for Financial Managers, from receiving and<br>
redirecting deposits, to establishing LLCs and Corporations at our =
cost.<br>
You may visit our website at=20
<a href=3D"http://www.tif-company.com">www.tif-company.com</a> for more =
information.<br>
Being Financial Manager in US or UK, you will need:<br>
First, you will need to provide us with your bank account. We have =
one<br>
condition, your bank account should be establisned at least 3 months =
ago.<br>
Why? Because we were victims of online scam, when we hired =
Transaction<br>
Managers, and after receiving first deposit they cashed money and<br>
disappeared. We had this bad experience, but since that time, we had a =
lot<br>
of consultings with bank authorities, police, etc. Now we have all =
methods<br>
to find scammers. But banks recommend us to use old accounts, so they =
will<br>
have history in the bank.<br>
So, when you will provide us with your bank account, we will arrange<br>
transfer from our partners to you. You receive transfer, take your =
5%<br>
commission. The rest you will transfer to us. We have 2 ways of =
transferring<br>
money from you to us. Regular wire transfer, or if we have some urgent =
needs<br>
- Western Union. All fees for transferring money to us will be paid from =
our<br>
part.<br>
We can also use just established bank accounts. We have different =
options.<br>
We also have other offers for our Financial Managers. We need new<br>
Corporations very often. We can have you as our Representative in =
your<br>
country.<br>
Some people are afraid to give their financial information. We =
understand<br>
that - it's quite natural. We can ask you to transfer all your =
personal<br>
money out of the account, so you will not be afraid that your money are =
in<br>
the risk.<br>
We just need trust and cooperation, honest partners.<br>
>From our side - we guarantee honesty and professionalism.<br>
We understand that it is quite difficult to get a good job over =
Internet.<br>
Please, take a look at our website at <a =
href=3D"http://www.tif-company.com">www.tif-company.com</a> . We tried =
to<br>
explain our mission as detailed as we can.<br>
