<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Attn: PRESIDENT/CEO<BR>
<BR>
I have received vital and useful information about you, I am =
satisfied<BR>
with such useful information's. Very pleased to be in contact with<BR>
you, for thepossibility of accepting my urgent proposal to =
you.&nbsp;<BR>
Please note that I don't have anything to hide for you, irrepecstive<BR>
that I have not seen you in person but because of the source I got<BR>
your particulars, I confidently believed that you will never betray<BR>
the confidence I have reposed in you.<BR>
<BR>
I am convinced that Nigerian Chamber of Commerce will never give me<BR>
any contact that is not reliable. Please note that I did not =
disclose<BR>
this transaction to anybody accept you and my two committee members<BR>
hence you should Keep this transaction secretly to yourself.<BR>
<BR>
My name is MR WAZIRI IBRAHIM, i am the chairman of the<BR>
investigating committee for the Niger Delta Development =
Commission&nbsp;<BR>
nvolving the foreign oil firms {Mobil oil, Elf oil, AGIP =
il,L.N.G},and<BR>
the Federal Government of Nigeria on the Delta Region. Furthermore, =
by<BR>
virtue of my position in this committee,I and my colleagues has been<BR>
able to negotiate out for ourself a total sum of twenty-four million<BR>
United States Dollars,&nbsp; $24,000,000}, which we&nbsp; want to =
transfer into<BR>
a reliable/save account outside Nigeria.<BR>
<BR>
These money accrued as a result of fund allocation given as<BR>
compensation inrespect to the damages in the Niger Delta region, =
which<BR>
was caused by Foreign expatriate working in the communities that was<BR>
affected. The communities demand for compensation to there =
farmlands,<BR>
Which has been ecologically destroyed by the activities of these<BR>
expatriate companies. The Government on its part submitted a bill of<BR>
14%support derivation for the Niger delta which the National =
assembles<BR>
passed into law.<BR>
<BR>
The oil companies on their part will compensate the Communities on =
an<BR>
agreed percentage {%}. Which we negotiated between the oil firms and<BR>
the community's representatives. Though the payment will be made<BR>
installmentally through a period of six months under our =
supervision.<BR>
<BR>
During the process of negotiation with both parties, we were able to<BR>
set aside the twenty-four million Dollars {$24'000'000}, For our own<BR>
use. But as you know the civil service rule and regulation ACT of<BR>
1999,prohibits civil servants from having foreign account,that is =
why<BR>
I am soliciting your assistance to provide for me your account<BR>
particulars,&nbsp; Where these money will be transferred quietly =
without<BR>
attracting much tax and can be easily withdrawn without raising<BR>
eyebrows.<BR>
<BR>
Besides,if you would want to discuss with me in person first,then =
you<BR>
can arrange to come to Nigeria for face to face meeting. If you will<BR>
play this role, of providing the receiving account, and at the same<BR>
time pledge your honesty not to double cross us at the end of the<BR>
transaction, we will be willing to give you only 20% ofthe total sum<BR>
at the successful conclusion of the transfer.&nbsp; Please do confirm to =
me<BR>
via e-mail your acceptance and particulars of your bank so that I =
will<BR>
commence action and will be keeping you posted on every development.<BR>
<BR>
Please also feel free to ask questions where necessary for further<BR>
clarification.&nbsp; Finally, this transaction is 100% risk free and I =
am<BR>
perfectly in control. With hope my explanation should be clear to =
your<BR>
understanding I look forward to having profitable business<BR>
relationship with you.&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
Thank you for your anticipated co-operation.<BR>
<BR>
Yours Faithfully,<BR>
<BR>
