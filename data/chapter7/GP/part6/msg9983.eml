<p><span class=3D"t">EpiPharma and Strategic Healthcare Systems Sign =
Letter of=20
Intent to Merge</span><br>
<b><br>
</b>SCOTTSDALE, Ariz.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 8, 2005--EpiPharma, Inc.=20
(&quot;EpiPharma&quot;) (OTC: EPHM) has signed a letter of intent to =
merge with Strategic=20
Healthcare Systems, Inc. (SHS), a healthcare management company that =
manages and=20
operates quality healthcare clinics in predominantly urban areas of =
California. </p>
<p>SHS is a healthcare management company founded in 1996 by Dr. Albert =
A. Gomez=20
to provide solutions to uninsured Americans and change the way in which=20
healthcare is marketed and delivered in America. SHS is organized as a =
virtual,=20
vertically integrated healthcare delivery system that coordinates the=20
interaction of physicians, patients and ancillary medical service =
providers in a=20
manner that is efficient and cost effective. The company currently =
manages=20
medical clinics, diagnostic centers and clinical laboratories located in =
San=20
Jose, San Francisco, Concord and Salinas, California. SHS lowers =
healthcare=20
costs by passing the savings gained from the advances in medicine and =
diagnostic=20
technology through to the patient.</p>
<p>Commenting on this transaction, Neil Reithinger, President of =
EpiPharma,=20
stated, &quot;Our intent with EpiPharma was to find the right fit with a =
partner such=20
as SHS that is established and profitable in the healthcare arena. =
Uninsured=20
Americans deserve the opportunity to have the kind of affordable and =
quality=20
healthcare that SHS has been providing to the community. Their multiple =
revenue=20
streams and sustained growth are a testament to the overall strength of =
their=20
business plan. Now, as part of a public company, SHS will have the =
opportunity=20
to finance their growth. SHS intends to develop more clinics in =
California and=20
markets in other states to provide more Americans with affordable =
medical=20
services.&quot;</p>
