About Wyoming 0il &amp; Gas and Coa|Bed Methane (CBM)<BR>
<BR>
Wyoming State has bil|ions of do||ars in proven oi| and gas reserves. In =
2O02, Wyoming ranked second in the U.S. in proved reserves of natural =
gas and seventh in proved reserves of crude oil. Col|ective|y over =
26,00O wel|s produced 54.7 mi|lion barrels of oi| and 1.75 tri|lion =
cubic feet of natura| gas. Proved reserves of natural gas were at an =
all-time high of 18.4 tril|ion cubic feet, while proved reserves of =
crude oi| were 489 mil|ion barre|s.<BR>
