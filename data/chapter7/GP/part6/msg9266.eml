number of<BR>
risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results or events to =
differ<BR>
materially from those presently anticipated. Forward looking statements =

&quot;could,&quot; or &quot;might&quot; occur. As with many microcap =
stocks, today's company has<BR>
additional risk factors that raise doubt about its ability to continue =
as a<BR>
going concern. Today's featured company is not a reporting company<BR>
registered under the Securities Act of 1934 and hence there is =
limited<BR>
information available about the company. Other factors include a =
limited<BR>
operating history,a nominal cash position, default on a loan, a lawsuit =
that<BR>
could effect the company's revenues and profitability, an =
accumulated<BR>
deficit since its inception and a reliance on loans from shareholders to =
pay<BR>
expenses. The company is going to need financing. If that financing does =
not<BR>
occur,the company&nbsp; may not be able to continue as a going concern =
in which<BR>
case you could lose your entire investment. Other risks and =
uncertainties<BR>
include, but are not limited to, the ability of the Company to complete =
its<BR>
business plan,reliance on key personnel, market conditions, the =
general<BR>
acceptance of the Company's products and technologies, competitive =
factors,<BR>
timing, and other risks associated with their business. The publisher =
