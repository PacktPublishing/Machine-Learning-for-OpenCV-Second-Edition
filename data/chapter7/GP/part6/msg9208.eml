&nbsp;Dear Sir/Madam<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;Forgive me if this letter comes to you as a surprise due to the =
fact that we do not know each other in person. I got your address from =
the South African Chambers of Commerce through a reliable source I am =
NICOLAS TAYLOR; the younger brother of to the Ex. President of LIBERIA =
CHARLES TAYLOR, the Ex. President TAYLOR is being step down as the =
president of Liberia. He has resigned and seek asylum in Nigeria country =
due to pressures mounted on him by the international community =
especially the UNITED STATE OF AMERICA. My Brother has resign as =
president in order to give peace a chance in our country Liberia.<BR>
<BR>
CHARLES TAYLOR has been a freedom fighter that fought all his life for =
the well being of Liberians. But due to the multi tribal nature of our =
country, REBELS From the enemy tribes have fought the ruling government =
of CHARLES TAYLOR, to the point where it has become impossible to =
maintain peace and tranquility. Presently we want to have some more time =
to relocate our wealth from Liberia to other foreign countries, where we =
can secretly invest our wealth profitably and peacefully. As of now, the =
president is now in NIGERIA where he is on asylum, the rest of our =
family including my three brothers and wife and children have left =
Liberia to seek refuge in foreign countries where they can have security =
and peace of mind. I am currently living in South Africa where I am =
living in asylum as a political refugee.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;This is why I am writing you. On my arrival to South Africa, I =
come with the sum of $USD10, 000.000 (TEN MILLION UNITED STATES =
DOLLARS).&nbsp; This money was given to me by Ex. PRESIDENT TAYLOR to =
buy military arms and ammunitions from South African allies. These =
ammunitions were meant to be used to curtail the insurgence of rebel =
forces into the capital city of Monrovia. Ex. president Taylor therefore =
instructed me to find a reliable partner that will assist me to transfer =
this money to a foreign account for my personal use. Currently the money =
is deposited in a private security company here in South Africa as =
classified consignment. And the security company does not know the real =
contents of this consignment. I simply deposited the money as diplomatic =
valuables to avoid the security company from interfering with the money. =
I shall want you to help me transfer this money overseas.<BR>
<BR>
I will appreciate if you can provide me with a bank account in a stable =
bank where we can transfer this money. I shall also want you to assist =
me in investing this money in any profitable venture for the future of =
my family.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;I am fed up of the disorganization and political instability of =
this CONTINENT thus I shall want to relocate my fund and my family to an =
oversea country where peace, security, political stability as well as =
financial consistency are all guaranteed.<BR>
<BR>
You will be given a commission for your assistance and other details of =
this transactions will be discussed when I receive your reply indicating =
your interest and readiness to assist me. I must also assure you that =
this transaction is totally legal and bears no risk whatsoever now or in =
the future. I have all the documents covering this money which I can =
send you if you desire. My family friends in the government and banking =
sectors here in South Africa will also help to make this transfer =
successful within the shortest time in the most legal way. They have =
assured me of their support.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;ALL I ASK FROM YOU ARE TRUST AND CONFIDENTIALITY. You are =
therefore to contact me immediately with the contact details provided =
above to discuss further details regarding this transaction. Thanks as I =
look forward to immediate response.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;Yours Sincerely<BR>
<BR>
