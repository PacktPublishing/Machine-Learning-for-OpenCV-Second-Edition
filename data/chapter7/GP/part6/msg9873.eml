<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry =
for<BR>
me, because, I believe everyone will die someday. My<BR>
name is .Mr John Willson,a merchant in U.K.I have been diagnosed<BR>
with Esophageal cancer .<BR>
<BR>
It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and<BR>
right now I have only about a few months to live,<BR>
according to medical experts. I have not particularly lived my life =
so<BR>
well, as I never really cared for anyone(not even myself)but my =
business.<BR>
Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to =
people and only focused on my<BR>
business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all =
this as I now know that there is more<BR>
to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I =
believe when God gives me a<BR>
second chance to come to this world,I would live<BR>
my life a different way from how I have lived it.<BR>
<BR>
Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property =
and assets to my immediate<BR>
and extended family members as well as a few close friends. I want God =
to be merciful to me and accept<BR>
my soul so I have decided to give also to charity organizations, as I =
want this to be one of the last good<BR>
deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity =
organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria<BR>
and<BR>
Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do =
this<BR>
myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my =
accounts and distribute the<BR>
money which I have there to<BR>
charity organizations in Asia and U.K, they refused<BR>
and kept the money to themselves.<BR>
<BR>
Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended =
with what I have left for them.<BR>
The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of =
twelve million dollars $12,000,<BR>
000.00 that I have with a finance institution in Europe. I will want you =
to help me collect this deposit and<BR>
dispatche it to charity organizations.<BR>
I have set aside 20% for you and some expences that may incure during =
the proccess of these<BR>
transaction.<BR>
<BR>
God be with you.Please reach me through my personal<BR>
email address of:johnwillson007@netscape.net.Please<BR>
remember to keep this known to yourself alone and I for now,as I am =
doing this as a contribution to life on<BR>
earth.I will also appreciate<BR>
if you provide me with your contact mobile and home phone numbers,so =
that i can forward them to a<BR>
reputable and a well trusted God fearing friend who would put you =
through the whole process.I will really<BR>
appreciate your quick response.<BR>
<BR>
Stay Blessed,<BR>
John Willson.<BR>
