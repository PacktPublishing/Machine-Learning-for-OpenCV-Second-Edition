As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I =
believe everyone will die someday. My<BR>
name is Phillip Williams, a merchant in U.K.I have been diagnosed with =
Esophageal cancer . It has<BR>
defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about =
a few months to live, according to<BR>
medical experts. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I =
never really cared for anyone(not even<BR>
myself)but my business.<BR>
<BR>
Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to =
people and only focused on my<BR>
business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all =
this as I now know that there is more<BR>
to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I =
believe when God gives me a<BR>
second chance to come to this world,I would live my<BR>
life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God has called =
me, I have willed and given most of<BR>
my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as =
well as a few close friends. I<BR>
want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so I have decided to =
give also to charity<BR>
organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good<BR>
deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity =
organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria<BR>
and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do =
this myself anymore. I once<BR>
asked members of my family to close one my accounts and distribute the =
money which I have there to<BR>
charity organizations in Asia and U.K, they refused and kept the money =
to themselves. Hence, I do not<BR>
trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have =
left for them. The last of my<BR>
money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of twenty five =
million dollars $25,000,000.00 that<BR>
I have with a finance institution in Europe. I will want you to help me =
collect this deposit and<BR>
dispatche it to charity organizations. I have set aside 20% for you and =
some expences that may incure<BR>
during the proccess of these transaction. God be with you.Please reach =
me through my personal email<BR>
address of: phillipwilliams@tangana.com&nbsp;&nbsp; remember to keep =
this known to yourse lf alone and I for<BR>
now,as I am doing this as a contribution to life on earth.I will also =
appreciate if you provide me with your<BR>
contact mobile and home phone numbers,so that i can forward them to a =
reputable lawyer who would put<BR>
you through the whole process.I<BR>
<BR>
will really appreciate your quick response.<BR>
Stay Blessed,<BR>
Phillip Williams<BR>
