In 1989, The Foundation for Innovation in Medicine<BR>
coined the term &quot;nutraceutical&quot; to give identity to a<BR>
highly promising area of health and medicine.&nbsp; Since<BR>
then, the nutraceutical market has become a highly<BR>
respected industry for supplement health, averaging a<BR>
7% increase year over year for the last 5 years.<BR>
<BR>
Martin Nutraceuticals was a natural progression that<BR>
started from the inception of bettering the lifestyle<BR>
of people.&nbsp; Since, Martin Nutraceuticals has created a<BR>
family of complimentary medicine and supplementation<BR>
that has helped thousands of people suffering from<BR>
arthritis and general joint pain, poor circulation,<BR>
tiredness, obesity and digestive complications.<BR>

many<BR>
microcap stocks, today's company has additional risk<BR>
factors that raise doubt about its ability to continue<BR>
as a going concern. Today's featured company is not a<BR>
rep0rting company registered under the Securities Act<BR>
of 1934 and hence there is limited information<BR>
available about the company. Other factors include a<BR>
limited operating history,a nominal cash position, an<BR>
accumulated deficit since its inceptiion,a negative<BR>
net worth and no revenues in its most recent<BR>
quarter. It is not currently an operating company. The<BR>
company is going to need financing. If that financing<BR>
does not occur,the company&nbsp; may not be able to<BR>
continue as a going concern in which case you could<BR>
lose your entire investment. Other risks and<BR>
uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the<BR>
ability of the Company to complete its business<BR>
plan,reliance on key personnel, market conditions, the<BR>
general acceptance of the Company's products and<BR>
technologies, competitive factors, timing, and other<BR>
risks associated with their business. The publisher of<BR>
