<BR>
May 18-- Nomad International Inc. (NDIN) commented today on the =
recent<BR>
announcement by the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications<BR>
Commission (CRTC) that they wou|d regulate Voice Over Internet =
Protocol<BR>
(VoIP) service on|y when it is provided and used as |oca| te|ephone<BR>
service.<BR>
<BR>
In its decision, the CRTC determined that in an effort to bui|d<BR>
sustainab|e competition in local te|ephone markets, the incumbent =
carriers<BR>
wi|| not be permitted to price their loca| VoIP services below cost =
to<BR>
stifle competition.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The ruling is a very positive one for Nomad in our efforts to =
enter<BR>
the Canadian market with our products via Internet Service =
Providers,<BR>
cable companies and virtual operators. The ru|ing permits us to enter =
the<BR>
market with a competitive framework,&quot; stated Jan O|iver, CEO of =
Nomad<BR>
International Inc.<BR>
<BR>
The key to Nomad's entry into the VoIP market is the ability of its<BR>
products to 0ffer services to both broadband and dial-up customers. =
Though<BR>
broadband is gaining more and more acceptance and uti|ization<BR>
wor|dwide, dia|-up remains the primary source of internet connectivity. =
In the<BR>
U.S. a|one, there are over 2OO,O00,000 users of the internet. Of the<BR>
tota| users in the U.S., the total number of users of broadband is =
on|y<BR>
approximate|y 4O,OOO,O00; (stats by the Yankee GrOup) dial-up =
therefore<BR>
represents approximately 8O% of the entire internet connectivity =
market.<BR>
The percentage of dia|-up versus broadband users worldwide is even<BR>
higher.<BR>
<BR>
Nomad's abi|ity to 0ffer VoIP products to dia|-up customers and =
service<BR>
providers not only offers significant potential for market =
penetration,<BR>
but also sets the Company apart from its competition in the =
marketplace<BR>
by offering a unique, proprietary and easi|y adaptable product.<BR>
<BR>
