<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Greetings,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pardon my intrusion into your privacy.This i =
know may<BR>
cause you some apprehension due to the unexpected nature,<BR>
but the circumstance which i am in now warrant that i do so<BR>
My name is Marco Dula; I am a victim of the recent<BR>
Earthquake followed by the Tsunami that wrecked our<BR>
whole society of Banda Aceh Province in Indonesia<BR>
resulting in painful death of my Parents.<BR>
My Late Father Mr. Alfredo Nula is from Paramaribo in<BR>
Suriname (South America) and my Mother from Banda of<BR>
Aceh Province in Indonesia, they got married in<BR>
Suriname because Indonesia like Suriname was a colony<BR>
of The Netherlands, but they moved to settle in<BR>
Indonesia when my Sister and I were born and because<BR>
Indonesia has better economy than Suriname, but my<BR>
Sister and I was away in School in the Capital Jakarta<BR>
when this sorrowful incidence happened to my late<BR>
parents and all other Families affected by the Quake<BR>
and the Tsunamis all around Sumatra and Aceh Province.<BR>
My Father and Mother owned a tourist resort and<BR>
grocery store at No 71 Panglima Polim Street, Banda<BR>
Aceh in Indonesia, it was visited by numerous tourists<BR>
from different countries on Holidays each year but<BR>
this tragic and devastating Tsunamis took the lives of<BR>
my parents and many others.<BR>
My Late Parents saved much of their money in a Bank in<BR>
The Netherlands, not only because we were Dutch Colony<BR>
but also because we speak Dutch as an official<BR>
Language in Suriname, I contacted my Parents Lawyer in<BR>
Hague and he has confirmed to me that my Parents has<BR>
the sum of 9Million Dollars deposited in savings in<BR>
The Netherlands which will be claimed by me as next of<BR>
Kin, but he also explained to me that because I was<BR>
not nationalized in Netherlands after Suriname got<BR>
Independence from the Netherlands I had no permission<BR>
to settle there in that Country.<BR>
We have recovered the corpses of my Late Parents,<BR>
although private, International and Government Aids is<BR>
coming in, it will not be any where enough to settle<BR>
our problems, please I am hereby soliciting for your<BR>
assistance in clearing my Late father's money, while I<BR>
will have the Lawyer arrange the necessary document<BR>
that will enable you have the power of Attorney to<BR>
effect the funds release from Netherlands. As soon as<BR>
you show a sincere intentions to help me and my<BR>
Sister, if you are business oriented with experience<BR>
in Holiday, Hotel and Resort business or have some<BR>
idea on how to run a groceries shop, I am willing to<BR>
recommit the money for the full benefit of all (My<BR>
Sister you and I) apart from that I shall be willing<BR>
to give a negotiable percentage of the money to you<BR>
otherwise or alternatively, please contact me on my<BR>
email address Dun479@netscape.net<BR>
as the telephone system is not<BR>
functioning at the moment.<BR>
Thank you, I hope you understand our predicament and<BR>
come to our assistance.<BR>
