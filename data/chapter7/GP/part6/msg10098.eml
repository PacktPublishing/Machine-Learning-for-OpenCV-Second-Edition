EDMOND, Okla.,-- uAuthorize Corporation (UACP), a global Internet =
marketer of business and Internet solutions, announced today that its =
Internet technologies division is completing development of a global =
Voice-Over-IP Service aimed at multinational callers using the power of =
the Internet to place phone calls through its software.<p>

The service, with an expected launch the end of this year, will employ =
multiple country Web sites in multi-language translations. The software =
will allow prepaid users to place calls using stand alone software or =
browser integrated plug-ins, and compression technology to solve latency =
problems that have plagued other VOIP solutions. Initial tests are =
scheduled to begin in the third quarter of this year and it is expected =
that a number of Web sites supporting the product will be launched in =
the United States, Australia, Russia, Japan, the United Kingdom, and =
many more countries during 2005.<p>
