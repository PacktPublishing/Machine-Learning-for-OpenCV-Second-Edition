<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Dear Sir/Madam,<BR>
<BR>
I would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail =
confidential<BR>
and respect the integrity of the information you come by as a result =
of<BR>
this mail. I am contacting you independently of our investigation and =
no<BR>
one is informed of this communication. I would like to intimate you =
with<BR>
certain facts that I believe would be of interest to you.<BR>
In 2001,&nbsp; Mr. RALPH BRINK came to our bank to engage in business =
discussions<BR>
with our private banking division. He informed us that he had a =
financial<BR>
portfolio of Eighteen million United States Dollars, which he wished to =
have<BR>
us turn over (invest) on his behalf. I was the officer assigned to his =
case,<BR>
I made numerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de-facto =
chief<BR>
operations officer of the private banking sector, especially given the =
volume<BR>
of funds he wished to put into our bank.<BR>
<BR>
We met on numerous occasions prior to any investments being placed.I =
encouraged<BR>
him to consider various growth funds with prime ratings.<BR>
The favored route in my advise to customers is to start by assessing =
data on 6000<BR>
traditional stocks and bond managers and 2000 managers of alternative =
investments.<BR>
Based on my advice, We spun the money around various opportunities and =
made<BR>
attractive margins for our first months of operation, the accrued profit =
and interest<BR>
stood at this point at over 20 million United States Dollars, this =
margin was not<BR>
the full potential of the fund but he desired low risk guaranteed =
returns on investments.<BR>
In mid 2002, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to =
make an urgent<BR>
investment requiring cash payments in the Netherlands. He directed that =
I liquidate<BR>
the funds and had it deposited with a firm in the Netherlands.<BR>
I informed him that ABN/AMRO BANK would have to make special =
arrangements to<BR>
have this done and in order not to circumvent due process, the bank =
would have<BR>
to make a 10.5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking and<BR>
statutory charges.<BR>
He complained about the charges but later came around when I explained =
to him the<BR>
complexities of the task he was asking of us.<BR>
I contacted my affiliate in Amsterdam and had the funds available.<BR>
I undertook all the processes and made sure I followed his precise =
instructions to<BR>
the letter and had the funds deposited at a Amsterdam based security and =
consultancy firm.<BR>
This Asset Management firm is a specialised private firm that accepts =
deposits from high<BR>
net worth individuals and blue chip corporations that handle valuable =
products or<BR>
undertake transactions that need immediate access to cash. This small =
and highly private<BR>
organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and =
well-connected organizations.<BR>
In line with his instructions, the money was deposited with an Asset =
Management firm.<BR>
Mr. RALPH BRINK told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his =
arrival from<BR>
England later that week. This was the last communication we had, this =
transpired around<BR>
25th February 2004.<BR>
<BR>
In June later that year, we got a call from the Asset management firm =
informing us of the<BR>
the inactivity of that particular portfolio. This was an astounding =
position as far as I<BR>
was concerned, given the fact that I managed the private banking sector =
I was the only one<BR>
who knew about the deposit at the firm, and I could not understand why =
Mr.RALPH BRINK had<BR>
not come forward to claim his deposit. All efforts to locate him was =
futile.I immediately<BR>
passed the task of locating him to the internal investigations =
department of ABN/AMRO.<BR>
Four days later, information started trickling in, apparently Mr.RALPH =
BRINK was dead.<BR>
A person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack =
in Canne, South of<BR>
France. We were soon enough able to identify the body and cause of death =
was confirmed.<BR>
The bank immediately launched an investigation into possible surviving =
next of kin to alert<BR>
about the situation and also to come forward to claim his estate.<BR>
If you are familiar with private banking affairs, those who patronize =
our<BR>
services usually prefer anonymity, but also some levels of detachment =
from conventional<BR>
processes. In his bio-data form, he listed no next of kin.<BR>
In the field of private banking, opening an account with us means no =
one<BR>
will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a name; =
depositors use numbers<BR>
and codes to make the accounts anonymous. This bank also gives the =
choice to depositors<BR>
of having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself, ensuring =
that there are no<BR>
traces of the account and as I said, rarely do they nominate next of =
kin.<BR>
Private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also =
usually in most cases leave wills in our care, in this case; Mr. RALPH =
BRINK died interstate. In line with our internal processes for account =
holders who have passed away, we instituted our own investigations in =
good faith to determine who should have right to<BR>
claim the estate. This investigation has for the past months been =
unfruitful.<BR>
We have scanned every continent and used our private investigation =
affiliate companies to<BR>
get to the root of the problem.&nbsp;<BR>
My official capacity dictates that I am the only party to supervise =
the<BR>
investigation and the only party to receive the results of the =
investigation.<BR>
According to practice, the&nbsp; Asset Management Firm will by the end =
of this financial year<BR>
broadcast a request for statements of claim to ABN/AMRO, failing to =
receive viable claims<BR>
they will most probably revert the deposit back to ABN/AMRO bank. This =
will result in the<BR>
money entering the ABN/AMRO accounting system and the portfolio will be =
out of my hands<BR>
and out of the private banking division. This will not happen if I have =
my way. What I wish<BR>
to relate to you might sound unethical practice but I want you to =
understand something. It<BR>
is only an outsider to the banking world who finds the internal politics =
of the banking<BR>
world aberrational. The world of private banking especially is fraught =
with huge rewards<BR>
for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios.<BR>
There is US$ 20.000,000.00 deposited in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, I =
alone have the<BR>
deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one unless I =
instruct them to do so.<BR>
I alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as ABN/AMRO is =
concerned,<BR>
the transaction with Mr. RALPH BRINK concluded when I deposited the =
funds with the asset management&nbsp; firm, all outstanding interactions =
in relation to the file are just customer services and&nbsp; due =
process.<BR>
<BR>
The Asset Management firm has no single idea of&nbsp; the history or =
nature of the deposit. They<BR>
are simply awaiting instructions to release the deposit to any party =
that comes forward.<BR>
This bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track this man's =
family; they have<BR>
investigated for months and have found no family. The investigation has =
come to an end.<BR>
My proposal;&nbsp; I am prepared to place you in a position to instruct =
the Asset Management firm<BR>
to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon =
receipt of the deposit,<BR>
I am prepared to share the money with you in half. That is: I will =
simply nominate you as<BR>
the next of kin and have them release the deposit to you. We share the =
proceeds 50/50.<BR>
I would have gone ahead to ask that the funds be released to me, but =
that would have drawn<BR>
a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit. I can =
assure you that I<BR>
could have the deposit released to you within a few days. I will simply =
inform the bank of<BR>
the final closing of the file relating to Mr. RALPH BRINK<BR>
I will then officially communicate with the Asset Management firm and =
instruct them to<BR>
release the deposit to you. With these two things: all is done.<BR>
If you find yourself able to work with me, contact me through the =
provided<BR>
email account. If you give me positive signals, I will initiate this =
process<BR>
towards a successful conclusion. .<BR>
I do not want any direct official link between you and me. My official =
lines<BR>
are not secure lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our =
level of customer<BR>
care in line with our Total Quality Management Policy. I strongly =
believe that you would<BR>
not betray my confidence in you.<BR>
Please send your response to edwardlaan@excite.it<BR>
If we can be of one accord, we should plan a meeting, soon.<BR>
I await your response.<BR>
Kind Regards<BR>
EDWARD LAAN<BR>
