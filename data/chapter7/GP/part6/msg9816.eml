of a contract awarded and executedfor and on behalf of my =

The contract was supposed to be awarded to two foreign<BR>
contractors,to the tone of US$180,000,000.00.<BR>

hundred and Thirty four Million, Five Hundred Thousand<BR>
United States Dollars)to my benefit unknown to the<BR>
contractor. This contract has been satisfactorily<BR>
executed and inspected.The Bulgarian firm is<BR>
presently securing payment from my Ministry,of which our<BR>
Board is in-charge of all foreign contract payment<BR>
approval.<BR>
As a civil servant still in active government<BR>
service, I am forbidden by law to operate an account<BR>
outside the shores of Zambia. Hence this message to<BR>
you seeking your assistance to enable me present<BR>
your private/company account details as a beneficiary<BR>
of contractual claims alongside with the Bulgarian contractor,<BR>
to enable me transfer the difference of US$45,500,000.00<BR>
(Forty five Million, Five Hundred Thousand United<BR>
States Dollars) into your provided account.<BR>

All logistics are in place and all modalities worked<BR>
out for a smooth actualisation of the transaction<BR>
within the next few working days of commencement. For<BR>
further details as to the workability of this<BR>
transaction, please reach me as soon as possible for<BR>
further clarification.<BR>
