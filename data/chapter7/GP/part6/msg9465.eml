<BR>
Dear Sir,<BR>
<BR>
It is indeed my pleasure to request for business partnership with =
great<BR>
pleasure, I write to solicit for your assistance in a matter that can be =
of<BR>
mutual benefit to us. I only pray that you read through my mail =
carefully and<BR>
respond as promptly as possible. Precisely, in the year 2000, the =
Ministry of<BR>
Minerals and Energy in South Africa where I work as a Manager of 14 =
Project<BR>
Allocation, received presidential irrevocable circular order requesting =
the<BR>
ministry to compile and forward the list of all past foreign =
contractors, whose<BR>
contract payments are pending since the period of the immediate past =
regime of<BR>
Dr, Nelson Mandela and the present regime.<BR>
<BR>
The purpose of this exercise was for the present South Africa elected =
government<BR>
to pay foreign contractors all debt owned, so as to maintain good =
relationship<BR>
with other foreign government and non-governmental financial agencies. =
In light<BR>
of the above, my colleagues and I duty to the past contractors, decided =
to<BR>
include a company&nbsp; name with a bill of {USD$11.5 Million United =
State Dollars}<BR>
along side other company name and their respective bill for payment =
impression<BR>
that {Alliance Mining SA PTY} which we incorporated here for this =
exercise, also<BR>
carried out contractual works of supply to the ministry as well as =
other.<BR>
<BR>
With the co-operation of top senior colleagues of mine we are confident =
that our<BR>
claim of {USD$11.5Million} shall be granted being for contract work =
executed at<BR>
the Ministry of Minerals and Energy, payment shall then be transferred =
upon<BR>
approval to a safe account that would be provided by you in other words, =
if you<BR>
accept to be our partner then you shall be considered given the =
pertinent<BR>
documentation to certify that your company had been awarded a contract =
already<BR>
executed, for which your company shall be paid the sum of =
USD$11.5Million.Please<BR>
<BR>
be informed that with the South Africa government monetary policy. =
Government<BR>
official &amp; employees are not allowed to operate or to own bank =
account abroad<BR>
hence our decision to seek a foreign partner.<BR>
<BR>
Please note, the legitimacy of this transaction is well pronounce, which =
I will<BR>
personally explain to you over the telephone to determine your true =
position. I<BR>
have the authority of my colleagues involved to propose that your =
consent to<BR>
this transaction will be highly compensated by a percentage agreed upon =
by both<BR>
parties after a successful completion of this project. Further =
information<BR>
concerning the transaction shall be forwarded to you upon your response =
to this<BR>
letter.<BR>
<BR>
I can assure you that my partners and I are in a position to make this =
payment<BR>
claim possible, provided you can give us the assurance and guarantee =
that our<BR>
share will be secured. Visualize this opportunity as an indirect =
financial<BR>
resource; also note that your area of specialization is not a hindrance =
in the<BR>
successful execution of this transaction, endeavour to contact me =
immediately by<BR>
the above email address because we will not compromise this transaction =
with any<BR>
form of exposure, as we are still in active civil servant.<BR>
<BR>
Thank you and God bless, as I wait in anticipation of your fullest =
co-operation.<BR>
Yours Faithfully,<BR>
<BR>
Dr William Masala</FONT>
