<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Dear ; Friend,<BR>
<BR>
First, I must apologize if my mode of first contact is not =
acceptable&nbsp; to<BR>
you and also solicit your confidence in this transaction; this is by =
virtue<BR>
of its nature as&nbsp; being utterly private and top secret. Though I =
know that a<BR>
transaction of this magnitude will make anyone apprehensive and worried. =
My<BR>
Name is Silvia Litana,I am the only dauther of late Mr. and Mrs Fred =
Nzinga<BR>
Litana who was assisinated in 2002 during a political unrest that =
engulfed<BR>
my Country Zambia&nbsp; recently. They where shot to dead my unknown =
Person(s)<BR>
who where accusing him of funding and sponsoring a factional Political =
group<BR>
with his money. So in respect of this they came to our House and =
shot<BR>
everyone dead including&nbsp; my two younger Siblings by then I was not =
at&nbsp;<BR>
home,But fortunately my Father did not die instantly that day. It took =
him&nbsp;<BR>
three Months later after that incident before he finally gave up the =
ghost.<BR>
<BR>
Before the death of my father, in October 28, 2002, in a private =
hospital,<BR>
he secretly called me on is bedside and told me that it has the sum =
of&nbsp; five<BR>
million, five hundred and thousand United States(USS5,500,000)dollars =
he<BR>
deposited it in a Finance and Security company here Dakar Senegal. with =
my<BR>
name as next of kin to the fund. Now, after the recent crisis that burst =
up<BR>
in my Country I ran to Senegal where my father deposited the fund and =
seeked<BR>
asylum, that is how I now&nbsp; went to stay in the United States =
Refugee Camp.<BR>
So that is where am&nbsp; currently staying for now. But the problem =
am<BR>
encoutering now is that when I went to the Financial holding company =
to<BR>
withdraw the&nbsp; money. I was made to understand that with my status =
as a<BR>
refugee I can not be able to clear the fund,but can do so with the help =
of a<BR>
forieng partner. They&nbsp; told me that the local law hear does not =
Permit a<BR>
refugee to operate any business atall, nor transact a fund of such<BR>
magnitude. So please dear, I am pleading, if ou can help me and stand as =
my<BR>
nominated next-of-kin and withdraw the fund for me (USS5,500,000) to =
your<BR>
account&nbsp; in your Coutry and I will be very glad to<BR>
<BR>
Please once can help me with this project, I will offer 15% percent =
of<BR>
themoney then after I will come over to your Country to start up a new =
life.<BR>
And also go into any profitable business you will advise me to do. =
Please<BR>
you can reply me with this alternate email address as it is the&nbsp; =
most<BR>
confidential for me at the moment. silvia_litana9@yahoo.com<BR>
<BR>
I will be waiting to hear your favourable response.<BR>
<BR>
Sincerely,<BR>
Silvia Litana<BR>
