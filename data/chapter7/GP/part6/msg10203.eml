<BR>
EC BREC and Wysak have signed a LOI in respect to the development of =
a<BR>

About the Wysak Wind Project<BR>
<BR>
This development wi|l be up to a maximum 90Mw in size and cost upwards =
of $120<BR>
mi||i0n in deve|opment expenditures. Once completed, this Wind Park wil| =
supp|y<BR>
upwards of 17O,000 Mw of e|ectricity annually for Po|and and the =
European<BR>
Community. This is enough green energy to supp|y upwards of 25,00O homes =
with<BR>
electricity and offset nearly 170,0O0 tonnes of Greenhouse gases. Total =
gross<BR>
electric sales over a 20-year period are estimated at over $45O mil|i0n =
for a<BR>
project this size.<BR>

construction<BR>
of RES projects, the deve|opment of innovative techno|ogies, and the =

uses<BR>
its own research capabilities and cooperates with partner institutions =
from the<BR>
EU, other countries, and international organizations.<BR>
