<br>I didn't hate dancing last night at eleven.. Brian was a boy with =
Down's Syndrome. He was taking several medications. Brian came from a =
nurturing family and extended family who provided him with every =
opportunity. His mother was a teacher and wanted what was best for him. =
He exhibited no language and was considerably behind his other friends =
with Down?s Syndrome. We set up a noun program at school. At first he =
seemed disinterested. He looked at the pictures and sucked his thumb. =
The more we encouraged him to engage the keyboard, the more he sucked =
his thumb. We then paired him with a child who was very interested in =
the noun program. Suddenly the two were fighting over who was next to =
pick a picture. He worked several times a week at the computer. At his =
3-year IEP, the team shook their heads. They didn't understand. Despite =
the track record of many students with Down?s Syndrome, Brian's language =
was his best skill. I smiled and his mother winked at me..
