<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Letter from: Daniel Kabila<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=
nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; INVESTMENT =
OFFER.<BR>
Dear,<BR>
In appreciation of your esteemed contact received through a reliable =
source<BR>
and the choice of your country I wish to introduce myself, I am Daniel =
Kabila<BR>
the son of the late DRC President Laurent Desire Kabila of the blessed =
memory.<BR>
I know this letter might come to you as a surprise but I honestly do =
not<BR>
intend to surprise you. I write this letter in respect of my intention =
to<BR>
invest the sum of US$12M(Twelve Million United State Dollars) with you. =
I<BR>
inherited this money from my mother. This money was got through the =
smuggling<BR>
and sales of Diamond and Timber when my father was the head of state. =
My<BR>
mother though not her legal wife used her privilege position to engage =
in the<BR>
business of Diamond and Timber since she knows that her survival will =
depend<BR>
on how much she can get out of the privilege situation.<BR>
<BR>
When my father was assassinated on 16TH Jan. 01 by one of his =
bodyguards<BR>
Lt.Rashidi Kasereke through the conspiracy of some top army officers =
that<BR>
wanted to topple him I escaped to SA because of the fear that I might =
be<BR>
arrested by my half brother Lt. General Joseph Kabila the present head =
of<BR>
state. Actually his mother and my mother are not in the best of =
relationship<BR>
because of who among them will be the first lady tussle and this =
ultimately<BR>
affected us their children. Considering the relationship between SA and =
my<BR>
country's new government, my mother advised me to leave For SA for =
security<BR>
reason, while the funds were deposited with a security Company =
abroad.<BR>
<BR>
On getting to there where I have been living since then as a political =
refugee<BR>
I am seeking for a reliable foreigner who can assist me in moving this =
money<BR>
out for safe banking and profitable investment. Honestly I contacted =
you<BR>
because I don't want to invest this money in here due to my status here =
as a<BR>
political Refugee. And moreover I wouldn't want to take risk because =
this<BR>
money is all that I and my Mother is depending on because My half =
brother has<BR>
seized all my father's assets and money and left I and my mother empty =
handed<BR>
without knowing about this funds deposited at the Security Company in =
abroad<BR>
so that is why I decided that investing this money abroad should be the =
best<BR>
investment for me. I will be honored if I can be given the privilege =
of<BR>
investing this money with your help.<BR>
<BR>
In view of this plight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough =
to<BR>
respond to this distress call to save my mother and I from a hopeless =
future.<BR>
And if you agree, I hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candid =
effort<BR>
in this regard with 15% of the total money and annual 5% of the =
after<BR>
tax returns on investment for the first three years. Thereafter, the =
term<BR>
shall be varied. 5% for expenses, which may arise during the =
transaction( fax<BR>
and phone bills inclusive). when the money is moved into your =
discrete<BR>
account, you will be allowed to draw 15% in your favor, while the =
remaining<BR>
80% will be invested meaningfully for our future if possible in your =
area of<BR>
business and deterrents sectors of the Economy in your country which =
are<BR>
dividends yielding.<BR>
<BR>
Whatever your decision is please reach me immediately through my =
Email,and<BR>
keep this letter tight secret for the interest of my family.<BR>
<BR>
Best Regards,<BR>
Daniel Kabila<BR>
