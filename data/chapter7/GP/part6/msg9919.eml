<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Hi there. My name is Julie, I am half british half =
scotish. I know its a weird mix :D, but I luv my beer and I luv =
partying. Well to be totaly honest I am very tired of going to unknown =
house parties and to wake up next morning god knows were O_O. So I have =
decided to have my parties on the web right here in my comfort zone. The =
best part about my cam is, its free. Yes, the only problem is, you have =
to verify your age, by doing this. It allows minors to stay away. I can =
get in alot of touble if minors view my site. Well anyways, come by say =
hi at least. Luv Julz,<BR>
