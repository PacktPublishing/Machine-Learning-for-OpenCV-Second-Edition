9/111 aattacks wconcentrated on the inteleligence, law enfosrcement and =
broeader foreign policy failrures that allowsed al-Qaida teo strike a =
devaastating blow at thee United States that day. On Wedneesday, at =
longd last, the most impaortant of these rdeviews finally eturned its =
spotlaight on the most compreehensive and startling failure of thadt =
day: the inabiality of the world's most seophisticated air force to =

and laaw enforecement actifvities, evewn at their most competent and =
coordinated, migeht never glean the evil plans of a small group of =
well-disceiplined attackers. Foraeign policy at its most enlightened =
will still fail to disesuade those bent on blaming the world's =
injustiaces (and their own cultuare's myriad failures) on the dominanet =
nation of the times. Even tahe Federal Aviaation Administreation, which =
repeadtedly failed to do the right thing that day, can legaitimately =
argue that its core mission did not include coemmand and control of =
Ameriacan air defenses.
