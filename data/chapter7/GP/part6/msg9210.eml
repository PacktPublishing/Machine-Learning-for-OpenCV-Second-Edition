I would come home late in the night and would get out early in the =
morning. We were running our lives somehow. There wasn't much of a =
conversation between Mia and I. Perhaps there wasn't anything left to =
talk about. And then in such compellingly disappointing conditions I =
found Tina. Even under these conditions she was full of life, breathing =
with all the energy. She wasn't very beautiful but she was definitely =
very attractive. So it was natural for me to take interest in her but =
what surprised me was that she attracted to me as well.<BR>
