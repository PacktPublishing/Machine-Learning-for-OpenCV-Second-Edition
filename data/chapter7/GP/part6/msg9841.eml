LEADERSHIP OF THE LIBERIAN FORMER PRESIDENT CHARLES TAYLOR, WHO IS NOW =
ON EXILE IN FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA.<BR>
I AM OFFICER INCHARGE OF PURCHASING ARMS AND AMINITIONS DURING THE YEARS =
OF LIBERIA CIVIL WAR. BUT RIGHT NOW I AM ON EXILE IN NIGEIRA WITH THE =
WAR LORD CHARLES TAYLOR. OUR LEAVING FOR EXILE IS RESULTED<BR>
FROM THE RESOLUTION OF THE INTERNATION COMMUNITY TO STOP THE BLOOD =
SHELDING AND TO ALLOW THEM MAINTIAN PEACE IN THE COUNTRY LIBERIA. THIS =
BROUGHT TO THE PUBLIC NOTICE THAT CHARLES TAYLOR WILL BE LEAVING ON =
EXILE IMMEDIATELY HE HANDED OVER THE GOVERNMENT ON 11TH AUGUST 2003 TO =
MOSES BLAH AS THE PRESIDENT OF INTERIM GOVERNMENT UNTILL A PROPER =
DEMOCRATIC ELECTION IS DONE.<BR>
AS IT IS NOW I WANT TO LEAVE NIGERIA TO SETTLE DOWN AND REHABILITATE MY =
LIFE FOR BETTER TOMORROW OF MY FAMILY.<BR>
THEREFORE, I WISH TO SOLICITE FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE TO HELP ME OUT OF THIS =
DISTRESS. ALTHOUGH, I KNOW IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE AND ACCEPT A =
STRANGER YOU DO NOT KNOW OR MET BEFORE. BUT I PLEAD YOU IN THE NAME OF =
ALMIGHTY GOD TO PLEASE WELCOME MY REQUEST AND GOD WILL BLESS YOU.<BR>
ON A CONFIDENTIAL MATTER, I HAVE TWO BOXES THAT CONTAINS ABOUT USD$5 =
MILLION RESERVED FOR THE PURCHASE OF THE WAR MATERIALS AND IT WAS IN MY =
OFFICE BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF THE INTERNATION COMMUNITY. BUT I FLY<BR>
TO NIGERIA WITH THE BOXES WITH THE ENTORAGE OF THE PRESIDENT TAYLOR.<BR>
FOR THIS INFORMATION, I HAVE MADE A SPECIAL ARRANGEMENT ON HOW TO SHIP =
THE BOXES TO YOU THROUGH A DIPLOMATIC COURIER SERVICES BECAUSE ACCORDING =
TO MY CONTACT PERSON HERE IT WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE FOR ME<BR>
TO TRAVEL OUT WITH THE BOXES. SO I WANT YOU TO RECEIVE THE BOXES FIRST =
BEFORE I ARRANGE FOR MY TRAVELING PAPERS. OFCOURSE I DO NOT HAVE ANY OF =
THEM.<BR>
SO IF YOU AGREED TO RECIEVE ME AND THE MONEY IN YOUR COUNTRY, YOU WILL =
ASSIST ME TO ESTABLISH SOME BUSINESS INVESTMENT.<BR>
FINALLY, NOTE THAT ONCE THE MONEY IS SENT TO YOU AND I COMES OVER =
SUCCESSFULLY, I WILL COMPERSATE YOU WITH 20% OK.<BR>
BUT PLEASE YOU SHOULD KEEP THIS LETTER VERY CONFIDENTIAL TO AVOID ANY =
TRACE OF MY WHERE ABOUT AND THE MONEY.<BR>
MOREOVER, I WANT YOU TO SEND ME YOUR PHONE AND FAX NUMBERS FOR EASY =
CONTACT. THE COPIES OF YOUR INTERNATIONAL PASSPORT OR MOTOR DRIVING =
LICENCE AND YOUR HOUSE CONTACT ADDRESS IS NEEDED TO FACILITATE<BR>
THIS DEAL ON MUTUAL TRUST AND SMOOTH OPERATION.<BR>
