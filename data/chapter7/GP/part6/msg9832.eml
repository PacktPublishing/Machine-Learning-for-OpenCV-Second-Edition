Biometrics Inc. (GALB.pk) is a biometrics company. By biometrics, we =
understand a company owning a technology enabling biometric recognition =
of individuals. The purpose of such recognition is to enhance or replace =
humans and human error in security access. Biometrics extends from =
fingerprint, facial recognition to iris reading,body measurements or =
equiv alent, in order to identify an individual in a minimally invasive =
way. We recon thatbiometrics is a new and promising industry, which is =
to security what biotechnology is to pharmaceutics. Galton Biometrics =
Inc. owns a portfolio of biometric solutions for any type of customer =
willing or needing to enhance its security systems. The demand for =
biometrics is being driven mainly by global threats, such as terrorism =
or corporate espionage. Galton Biometrics inc. has gathered a =
substantial port! folio of technologies,
  which it owns or in some cases has a license agreement for in order to =
service its customers.</P><P><STRONG>Stock Chart<BR></STRONG><BR>Galton =
Biometrics Inc's stock has been trading since November 15th, 2004 with =
an average of 355000 shares per day. After the initial euphoria on the =
stock, GALB.pk has stabilized on a few announcements by the company on =
its strategy for the future. Since February 1st, the stock is back on an =
uptrend. </P><P><BR><STRONG>Industry Analysis</STRONG></P><P>An Industry =
Comparables Analysis (ICA) has been performed on Galton Biometrics Inc. =
The biometrics industry is quite new and fits into the broader industry =
of Security Systems and Services. The major players in the sector are =
tabulated here below. A few elements characterize this industry:<BR>- =
More than 90% of the companies in the security hardware and software =
business are profitable companies. This has been an industry standard =
for years and is not likely to disappear. The nature of this bu
 siness is that companies regularly achieve high profit margins (in =
percentage to sales).<BR>- The industry has been growing quite well =
also. A good year for the present companies is 25% and a bad year would =
be 15%. This trend is also an expression of the Homeland Security =
Effect. Most companies potentially benefiting from a contract with a =
large government agency (customs, defense or equivalent) will perform =
well and deserve higher multiples.<BR>- Investors appreciate security =
stocks and thereby the price multiples found are quite high by =
comparison to other industries. Global threats, such as terrorist =
threats or corporate espionage and factors that construct these high =
multiples. They are the expression of the trust of investors for the =
need to such products and services.<BR>- When a company has higher =
component of software rather then hardware, its margins will be higher =
than the industry's margins and also its stock price multiples will be =
higher. </P><P>Galton Biometric
 s Inc. was founded at the end of 2004, and got organized as a company =
owning a portfolio of technologies in the field of biometrics. These =
technologies allow the company to have a solutions approach for its =
customers, thus spreading its busi ness risk, and to fall into the trap =
of becoming a technology focused business, with a single product, single =
customer vision. Galtons primary target is customs facilities, airports =
and sensitive office building. The following forecast income statement =
allows a view of the developments planned for the company. These numbers =
might seem quite conservative to the average investor. Nevertheless, one =
could also forecast a five-fold revenue figure from the one forecast. =
One single customs contract could potentially be substantially superior =
to the numbers proposed here. What remains certain, and wh! ich is =
expressed in the forecasts, is the demand for the technology in general =
and the relatively high margins the company should be able to achie
 ve by comparison to its peers.</P><P><FONT =
