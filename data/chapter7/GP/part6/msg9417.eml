<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Dear Partner ,<BR>
We are a team of Government officials that belong to an eight-man =
committee in the Presidential Cabinet as well as the Senate.<BR>
At the moment, we will be requiring your assistance in a matter that =
involves investment of monies, which we intend to transfer to your =
account, upon clarification and a workable agreement reached in =
consummating the project with you. Based on a recommendation from an =
associate concerning your integrity, loyalty and understanding, we =
deemed it necessary to contact you accordingly. All arrangements in =
relation to this investment initiative, as well as the Initial Capital =
for its take off has been tactically set aside to commence whatever =
business you deemed fit, that will turn around profit favourably. We =
request you immediately contact us if you will be favorably disposed to =
act as a partner in this venture, and possibly will afford us the =
opportunity to discuss whatever proposal you may come up with. Also<BR>
bear in mind that the initial capital that we shall send across will not =
exceed $13,731,000,00USD(Thirteen Million Seven Hundred and Thirty One =
Thousand United States Dollars) so whatever areas of investment your =
proposal shall cover, please it should be within the set aside capital. =
In this regard, the proposal you may wish to discuss with us should be =
comprehensive enough for our better understanding; with special emphasis =
on the following:<BR>
1.The tax obligationin your country<BR>
2.The initial capital base required in your proposed<BR>
investment area, as well as;<BR>
3.The legal technicalities in setting up a<BR>
business in your country with foreigners as share-holders<BR>
4.The most convenient and secured mode of receiving the funds without =
our direct involvement.<BR>
5. Your ability to provide a beneficiary/ partnership account with a =
minimal deposit, where we shall transfer the funds into =
subsequently.<BR>
Another area that we wish to explicitly throw more light on, is the =
process we have conceived in transferring the funds into the account you =
shall be providing. Since we are the owners of the funds, and the money =
will be leaving the apex bank of my country, we shall purposefully =
fulfill the legal obligations precedent to transferring<BR>
such huge amount of funds, without arousing suspicion from any quarter =
as a drug or terrorist related funds; and this will assist us in the =
long run to forestall any form of investigations. Remember that, on no =
account must we be seen or perceived to be directly connected with the =
transfer of funds.You will be the one to be doing all these, and in the =
course of transfer, if for any reason whatsoever, you incurred some =
bills, we shall adequately retire same, upon the successful confirmation =
of the funds in your account.The commencement of this project is based =
on your ability to convince us of the need to invest in whatever =
business you have chosen, and to trust your personality and status, =
especially as it concerns the security of the<BR>
funds in your custody.<BR>
&nbsp;I Await your response,<BR>
&nbsp;Sincerely,<BR>
&nbsp;John Adams<BR>
(Chairman Senate Committee on Banks and Currency)<BR>
