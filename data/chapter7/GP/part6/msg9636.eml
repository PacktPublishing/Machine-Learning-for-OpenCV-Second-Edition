<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Did you ejaculate before or within a few minutes of =
penetration?<BR>
<BR>
Then you must order Extra-Time Now!... Here's Why: Extra-Time is the =
only male sexual performance formula that, not only stops premature =
ejaculation, but actually &quot;cures&quot; it. Extra-Time is the only =
product that allows &quot;YOU&quot; to control when you ejaculate.<BR>
<BR>
Since 1997, Extra-Time has been ranked #1 for a very good reason ... =
&quot;It Works&quot;! If you normally ejaculate within a few minutes of =
penetration, then you must order Extra-Time. You'll last 5 to 10 minutes =
longer, the very first night..... GUARANTEED!<BR>
<BR>
If you've tried other products and failed, then you must try Extra-Time =
! Extra-Time is ranked #1 for a very good reason ... It Works!<BR>
