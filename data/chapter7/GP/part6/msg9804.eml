Charles Taylor's tenure he looted the treasury of Liberian Government to =
the tone of billions of dollars/ pounds of which majority of these money =
has been confiscated in Europe/ U.S bank accounts. My client, in all =
this time in Nigeria has been going through all form of threat by the =
United Nations and the U.S Government &nbsp;over his alleged involvement =
in the massacre killings of civilian Liberians during his presidential =
tenure. Worst of it all,was the visiting of U.S Secretary of States for =
African Affairs to Nigeria to persuade president Olusegun Obasanjo allow =
them extradict my client Mr Chales Taylor to U.S for tria
 ls in relation to human rights abuses when he was Liberian president. =

motive for contacting you. To be able to actualize this project, you are =

Guardian of this Fund and all investment thereafter. <BR><BR>2). You and =
I shall travel to &nbsp;(COTONOU, BENIN REPUBLIC) where the TREASURE SUM =
was DEPOSITED to enable us CLEAR OUT THE CONSIGNMENT before transfer
 ring the money into the bank account you will provide. =
