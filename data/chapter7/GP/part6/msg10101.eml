EDMOND, Okla., Oct 15, 2004 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- uAuthorize Corporation =
(Pink Sheets:UACP), a global Internet marketer of business and Internet =
solutions, announced today that its VOIP technologies division has =
completed a marketing agreement for the IPT 2.1 - Internet Telephony =
Handset, as an add-on product for its voice over Internet telephony =
services, currently under final development.<p>=20

The IPT 2.1 is a second generation telephone handset for computers, =
specifically designed for home/SOHO users of Internet telephony. Until =
now, users making Internet phone calls from a PC have used a microphone =
and speaker connected to the soundcard. Others use a headset combining =
earphones and a microphone. Both of these systems have their drawbacks. =
1. The use of a speaker limits the privacy of the phone call and gives =
the familiar feedback problem when the microphone picks up the speaker =
output. 2. The headset solution avoids the feed-back but does not allow =
you to hear the ring of an incoming call, unless you keep it on your =
head all the time.<p>=20

The IPT 2.1 permits the user to make phone calls via the Internet with =
the same comfort and convenience offered by a conventional telephone =
handset. You pick it up when you need it, and you put it back on its =
cradle when you are finished with your call. "We believe this product =
makes the entire Internet telephony experience more traditional for the =
average user, and thereby encourages more use of VOIP services instead =
of traditional phone calls," stated Dino Price, president of =
uAuthorize.<p>=20

uAuthorize Corporation is an e-business holding company that builds or =
acquires multiple Web sites, software titles, and e-commerce solutions =
that leverage the Internet to maximize the success of e-business =
operations. The Company's portfolio of online brands encompasses three =
distinct content categories including , Internet technologies, and =
business solutions<p>
