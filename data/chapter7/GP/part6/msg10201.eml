<P><FONT SIZE=2>Dear Friend,<BR>
<BR>
In our search for a trustworthy individual to work with us<BR>
on a very<BR>
important and confidential project, we came across your<BR>
esteemed profile.<BR>
My name is Godwin Sekobe, a principal executive officer in<BR>
the audit<BR>
department of the amalgamated bank of South Africa( ABSA)<BR>
here in South Africa.<BR>
During the yearly preliminary in-house auditing of<BR>
accounts, I discovered an<BR>
account opened in 1996 and since 1997 has remained dormant<BR>
which means that<BR>
nobody has been operating it up till date. The total amount<BR>
in this account is<BR>
$18.6m less accrued interest.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Working together with the audit manager, we decided to<BR>
investigate this<BR>
account for more information. We discovered that the owner<BR>
of this account,a<BR>
foreigner has died inter-state leaving no heirs or next of<BR>
kin who could make a<BR>
claim. Presently, we are the only two people in our<BR>
organization with access to this<BR>
information and we have decided to keep it that way and<BR>
claim the money for ourselves<BR>
using a third party who will take the place of the deceased<BR>
next of kin.<BR>
<BR>
We will supply the necessary information on the deceased<BR>
and ensure that the claim application is giving immediate<BR>
approval. Documents like the death certificate will be<BR>
arranged and forwarded to you for onward submission to the<BR>
bank.The project is risk-free<BR>
as we will use contacts that hold strategic positions in<BR>
the bank to effect a successful completion of the project<BR>
and also ensure that all traces of our mutual involvement<BR>
are completely wiped off.These presents no problem as all<BR>
documented evidence will be directly under their<BR>
supervision.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
We have earmarked a commission of 30% of the total amount<BR>
for you. A further 5% will be set aside to cover expenses<BR>
on both sides, which will include expenses incurred in<BR>
processing this claim. The remaining 65% you will help us<BR>
invest in profitable stocks and shares in your country. We<BR>
would like to get your decision to this proposal as soon as<BR>
possible. On of receipt your decision.<BR>
<BR>
Endeavour to contact me immediately via&nbsp; mail to confirm<BR>
your interesred.<BR>
