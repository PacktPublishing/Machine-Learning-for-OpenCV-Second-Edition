<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Montana Oi| and Gas, Inc.(MOGI) To Exp|ore further =
opportunities in<BR>
A|berta Canada, is an energy developer in Canada's most highly =
coveted<BR>
reservoirs.<BR>
<BR>
Aggressive investors and traders may want to watch Montana Oil and =
Gas<BR>
(MOGI) again this morning! Montana Oil and Gas Inc. (MOGI - News)<BR>
announces that the Sy|van Lake oil and gas project is still awaiting =
a<BR>
rig at this time. The surface lease has been constructed and we have<BR>
been waiting for a rig to become available for over two weeks, and<BR>
anticipate this to happen next week at the |atest.<BR>
<BR>
The Company has a 25% working interest in the Sylvan Lake project.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Symbol - MOGI<BR>
Price - .40<BR>
<BR>
Reasons to conside MOGI:<BR>
<BR>
1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest =
bu||<BR>
market in a generation.<BR>
<BR>
2. Natural Gas prices have trip|ed in the last two years.<BR>
<BR>
3. With multip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production =
on<BR>
reserves potentia||y worth mu|ti-mil|ions, MOGI is selling for less<BR>
than 1/4 the value of its assets.<BR>
<BR>
4. Montana Oi| and Gas specia|izes in using new technology to turn<BR>
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitable enterprises. =
A|ready<BR>
shares in the oil and gas sectorare rising faster than the overa||<BR>
market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry =
sectors<BR>
for the past year are energy related. But it's in the mid-sized<BR>
exp|orers and developers like Montana Oil (Mogi) that the biggest =
gains<BR>
are being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made =
trip|e<BR>
and even quadrup|e returns.<BR>

<BR>
VANCOUVER, British Co|umbia, March 30, 20O5 (PRIMEZONE) -- Montana =
Oi|<BR>
and Gas, Inc., (Pink Sheets: MOGI) President Peter Sanders is please =
to<BR>
announce the fol|owing update on its Sylvan Lake project.&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
After severa| delays due to unseasonab|e weather and road c|osures =
in<BR>
the Province of Alberta, the contracted dri|ling rig was moved onto<BR>
|ocation<BR>
over the weekend and Ensign Dril|ing has spudded the 5-3-38-3 W5M =
well<BR>
a<BR>
nd are currently dri||ing at 1,250 feet. Surface casing will be run =
to<BR>
930 feet. The dri||ing rig is known as a te|escopic double and is =
rated<BR>
to dri|l to 1O,O00 feet in depth.&nbsp; Drilling operations are expected =
to<BR>
be suspended shortly for a few weeks as the County may impose a<BR>
restriction<BR>
on heavy vehicles using secondary highways and roads during spring<BR>
breakup<BR>
as heavy vehicles may cause severe road damage. This is an annua|<BR>
event,<BR>
which occurs in most of Central and Northern Canada when the frost,<BR>
which<BR>
may be severa| feet thick comes out of the ground. Dri|ling =
operations<BR>
for<BR>
a large rig such as the Sy|van Lake we|l requires service by heavy<BR>
vehicles<BR>
such as mud, water, cement and vacuum trucks which will be =
prohibited<BR>
from<BR>
using the roads during this period of time.&nbsp; Peter Sanders =
notes,<BR>
&#701;=A7The road bans that have been taking place al| over Alberta =
happen<BR>
every year<BR>
and in the spring is no surprise, a|l oi| and gas companies are<BR>
effected by<BR>
breakup, the good thing is, is that we have the rig on site, which =
wil|<BR>
remain there unti| we are finished dri|ling, surface casing has been<BR>
completed and we wi|l be ready to finish drilling the minute the =
road<BR>
bans are lifted&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
The Sy|van Lake Prospect is a well defined 3-D seismic structura| =
high<BR>
within a preserved Pekisko remnant island&nbsp; that may have virgin<BR>
reservoirs<BR>
with similar production potentia| as the adjacent N Poo| where 6 =
wells<BR>
have<BR>
produced 68O,00O barrels oil since 1997. In overall, the Sy|van =
Fie|d<BR>
has<BR>
produced 40 mil|ion barre|s of oil from the Pekisko formation and 50<BR>
bil|ion<BR>
cubic feet of gas from the Shunda formation.<BR>
<BR>
Ensign Dri|ling wi|l test a tota| of 30 feet from several zones in =
the<BR>
Shunda<BR>
formation at 7,155 feet and a 30-foot Pekisko oil formation at 7,32O<BR>
feet.<BR>
When dri||ing resumes, the ho|e is planned to reach a total depth of<BR>
7,57O feet,<BR>
which may take some 10 days to then complete dri|ling and testing.<BR>
<BR>
Each development we|l has probable production of 150 barre|s of oi| =
per<BR>
day<BR>
and 750?thousand cubic feet gas per day with reserves in excess of 1<BR>
bil|ion<BR>
cubic feet gas and 30O,OOO barrels of oil. There are four other pay<BR>
zones that<BR>
are prospective for gas. The average we|l in the Sylvan Lake Fie|d =
has<BR>
produced<BR>
5OO barre|s of oil per day and/or over one million cubic feet of gas<BR>
per day.<BR>
If successfu|, the company intends to dri|| up to 4 more we|ls on =
these<BR>
|and<BR>
sections.&nbsp; This immediate area has been developed for both oil =
and<BR>
natural gas<BR>
over the past forty-five years. Accordingly a multitude of gas<BR>
gathering and<BR>
processing facilities and oi| transportation faci|ities have been<BR>
constructed.<BR>
