Breaking News!!<BR>
<BR>
The Board of Directors of AmeriChip International Inc. (ACHI-<BR>
News) is pleased to announce that Seco-Carboloy (``Carboloy'')<BR>
has awarded an expanded territory in the state of Michigan to<BR>
the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, AmeriChip Tool and<BR>
Abrasives (``ATA'') as a direct result of successful<BR>
representation of the Carboloy line of machine tools since July<BR>
2004.<BR>
<BR>
ATA has experienced increased sales over the past two months<BR>
which will be reflected in our 10Q due to be filed on July<BR>
15th. Mr. Tom Frasier, ATA's vice president of sales, said,<BR>
``In order to take advantage of the 0pp0rtunity to maximize its<BR>
sales objectives afforded by the new territory, the Company<BR>
intends to expand its sales force. The addition to our sales<BR>
force will allow us to be very competitive in a $35 milli0n<BR>
industry.''<BR>
<BR>
As previously reported, the Company is working closely with<BR>
Carboloy in its on-going efforts to assist AmeriChip's<BR>
customers in maximizing cost sav-ings in all aspects of metal<BR>
removal in the machining of their parts. The Company's<BR>
relationship with Carboloy centers around machine time studies<BR>
as they relate to throughput and tool evaluations upon the<BR>
implementation of the Company's Laser Assisted Chip Control<BR>
technology.<BR>
<BR>
Headquartered in Plymouth, MI, AmeriChip International Inc., a<BR>
process technology company, holds a patented technology known<BR>
as Laser Assisted Chip Control, the implementation of which<BR>
results in efficient chip control management in industrial<BR>
metal machining applications. This technology provides<BR>
substantial sav-ings in machining costs of certain automobile<BR>
parts providing much more competitive pricing and more<BR>
aggressive sales approaches within the industry.<BR>
<BR>
The innovative AmeriChip business model, enhanced by its<BR>
AmeriChip Tool and Abrasives subsidiary, is designed to<BR>
establish an extensive resource for cost saving services and<BR>
products that all cost-conscious industrial steel and aluminum<BR>
machining companies require. AmeriChip is committed to keeping<BR>
jobs in America for Americans.<BR>
<BR>
About the Company<BR>
<BR>
AmeriChip International Inc., through its wholly owned<BR>
subsidiary AmeriChip Ventures, Inc. has developed a patented<BR>
technology, supported by 15 years of engineering, designed to<BR>
eliminate the long and often dangerous ribbon-like steel chips<BR>
that tangle around moving tool parts, automation devices and<BR>
other compontents essential to the machine processing of low to<BR>
medium grade carbon steels and non-ferrous metals. The result<BR>
of this process is a superior product, manufactured in a safer<BR>
working environment, avoiding many of the health and safety<BR>
issues associated with traditional metal processing<BR>
methodologies, while offering potential cost s a v i n g s int<BR>
the billions of dollars.<BR>
