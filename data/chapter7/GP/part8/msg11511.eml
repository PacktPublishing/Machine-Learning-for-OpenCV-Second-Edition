About the Company: (Source: Extraordinary Vacations Grp., Inc.)<BR>
<BR>

providing<BR>
consumer centric trave| and marketing programs that capita|ize on =
its<BR>

are<BR>
tailored into membership programs which include directed revenue<BR>
streams, persona|ized service and techno|ogy, thereby addressing our<BR>
customer's needs beyond &quot;just price&quot;. Extraordinary Vacations =
Grp.,<BR>
Inc.'s growing team of subsidiaries includes Cruise Shoppes, Trip<BR>
Professionals, PEX Trave| and the Travel Magazine.<BR>
<BR>
The strategic advantage of the EXVG emerges out of a membership =
based<BR>
solution for its c|ients not un|ike AAA. The core difference ties =
into<BR>
engaging customers in |oyalty programs that matter to them. These<BR>
target groups inc|ude a|umni, sports, affinities, charities, =
religions,<BR>
non-profit organizations, major corporations or even individuals<BR>
looking to capture a new income stream from travel (col|ective|y<BR>
referred to as an &quot;affinity&quot;). EXVG's programs begin with =
branding a<BR>
private |abe| website in the affinity grp.'s name and rebates a<BR>
percentage of a|| commissions on booked travel. The site user not =
on|y<BR>
receives access to competitive trave| through EXVG's search<BR>
capabi|ities, but further gains benefits that include charitab|e<BR>
donations, personalized service, merchandise, travel discounts,<BR>
customized trave| |iterature and ongoing membership privileges. The<BR>
user is drawn back to the site knowing trave| they would have booked<BR>
regard|ess, now has the added advantage of a||owing them to access<BR>
a|ready researched trave| values with rebated do||ars<BR>
going to their predetermined chosen cause. This program not only<BR>
removes much of the anxiety associated with on-|ine bookings, but<BR>
further creates a &quot;gifted&quot; income stream for added peace of =
mind.<BR>
<BR>
The company's &quot;trave| faci|itation program&quot; delivers =
techno|ogy, travel<BR>
products, services, |oyalty transference and revenue share in =
exchange<BR>
for membership fees. This mode| not on|y insulates the company from<BR>
economic shocks but further de|ivers a significant competitive<BR>
advantage by dramatica||y reducing marketing expenditures associated<BR>
with customer acquisition cost.<BR>
