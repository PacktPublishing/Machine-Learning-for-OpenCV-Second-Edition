<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Hi,<BR>
<BR>
Did you know?<BR>
You can now get $347,000 for as little as $607 a month!<BR>
Why should you pay more when you can save thousands re-financing at our =
low rates?<BR>
Remember, that rates are due to jump withint he next few months.<BR>
Bad credit? Doesn't matter, low rates are fixed no matter what!<BR>
<BR>
Use the extra for home additions, improvements, or whatever you could =
not afford to do before.<BR>
Fill out this 30 sec. form and be approved within the next 24 hours.<BR>
