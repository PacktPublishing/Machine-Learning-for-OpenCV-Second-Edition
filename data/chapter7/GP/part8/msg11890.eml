FROM THE DISK OF<BR>
DR.NUEL EZE.<BR>
Lagos-Nigeria<BR>
<BR>
DEAR SIR/MADAM<BR>
<BR>
I am DR.NUEL EZE. Chairman of the Tender Committee of<BR>
the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). My Committee is<BR>
principally concerned with payment of all contract awarded from 1998 =
to<BR>
date, in order of priority as regard capital projects of the NNPC. The =
information<BR>
we gathered from the Foreign Office of the Nigeria Chambers of =
Commerce<BR>
and Industries is so positive as to convince us that you would provide =
us<BR>
with solution to a money transfer deal valued at Thirty One Million =
United<BR>
States Dollars and subsequently a jointbusiness venture.<BR>
<BR>
In the course of our duties as values, and project inspectors for =
the<BR>
on-going liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) project, we have over-invoiced =
the<BR>
value of some jobs done by foreign contractors for the NNPC to the =
tune<BR>
of US$31M.As follows: - Computer optimization and Installation =
$16,000.000.00<BR>
Installation of 250,000.00 Monax Turbine$10,000.000.00 Turn Around =
Maintenance<BR>
$5,000,000.00 Our aim of over-invoicing this payment is to divert the =
excess<BR>
amount to a discrete account abroad. This fund is now floating in =
suspense<BR>
account at the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). This is the fund my =
colleagues<BR>
and I have decided to transfer into your account since we,as civil =
servants<BR>
are not allowed to operate or own foreign account. The money will be =
shared<BR>
as follows after transfer:30% for you (Account Owner) 60% for me and =
my<BR>
colleagues 10% to off-set both local and international expenses that =
Would<BR>
be incurred in the course of this transaction.<BR>
<BR>
To be able to claim the funds, we will be purporting your company to =
be<BR>
the original contractor / beneficiary of the funds so all procedures<BR>
for international transfer shall be strictly followed, as we have<BR>
worked out all modalities for a swift and riskfree transfer.<BR>
<BR>
If this proposal satisfies you, please contact me Through<BR>
nueleze2004@yahoo.it with the following important<BR>
information. Bank Name / Address Account Name ,Account NumberTel/Fax =
Telex<BR>
of Bank Personal Phone / Fax Numbers for easy communication. This =
transaction<BR>
will last for 14 working days from the time we submit the required =
information,<BR>
as all modalities concerning this transaction have been worked out and =
it<BR>
is completely riskfree.<BR>
<BR>
Please be informed that this subject is classified sensitive.<BR>
Therefore treat the transaction with utmost confidentiality and<BR>
urgency.<BR>
Yours<BR>
Faithfully.<BR>
DR.NUEL EZE<BR>
