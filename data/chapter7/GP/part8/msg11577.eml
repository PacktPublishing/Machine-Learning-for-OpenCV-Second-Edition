estimates and projections at the time the statements are made that =
involve a number of risks and uncertainties which could cause actual =
results or events to differ materially from those presently anticipated. =
Forward looking statements in this action may be identified through the =

that by statements indicating certain actions &quot;may,&quot; =
&quot;could,&quot; or &quot;might&quot; occur. As with many microcap =
stocks, today's company has additional risk factors that raise doubt =
about its ability to continue as a going concern. SKRCO, Inc is not a =
reporting company registered under the Securities Act of 1934 and hence =
there is limited information available about the company. Other factors =
include: a limited operating history,an accumulated deficit since its =
inception and a reliance on loans from officers and directors to pay =
expenses, changes in the regulatory and general economic environment; =
conditions in the capital markets, including the interest rate =
environment and the availability of capital; changes in the competitive =
marketplace that could affect the Company's revenue and/or cost and =
expenses, such as increased competition, lack of qualified marketing, =
management or other personnel, and increased labor and inventory costs; =
changes in technology or customer requirements, which could render the =
Company's technologies noncompetitive or obsolete; trends affecting the =
Company's financial condition or results of operations; the Company's =
ability to continue to control costs and to meet its liquidity and other =
financing needs; new product introductions, product sales mix and the =
geographic mix of sales. The company is going to need financing. If that =
financing does not occur, the company may not be able to continue as a =
going concern in which case you could lose your entire investment. The =
