Nathaniel&nbsp; Energy&nbsp; has&nbsp; a&nbsp; 51%&nbsp; ownership&nbsp; =
interest&nbsp; in a helium and gas<BR>
processing facility in Keyes, Oklahoma. This facility produces =
2,000,000<BR>
mcf (thousand cubic feet) of natural&nbsp; gas annually, 5,500 mcf of =
natural<BR>
gas daily and 3,600 gallons of natural&nbsp; gas&nbsp; liquids&nbsp; =
daily.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nathaniel<BR>
Energy&nbsp; also&nbsp; acquired a 130-mile pipeline that collects =
natural gas for<BR>
the&nbsp; plant&nbsp; from&nbsp; over&nbsp; 50&nbsp;&nbsp; =
gas&nbsp;&nbsp; wells.&nbsp; The&nbsp; acquisition&nbsp; included&nbsp; =
a<BR>
take-and-pay contract with Air Products&nbsp; and&nbsp; Chemicals,&nbsp; =
Inc.&nbsp; for&nbsp; the<BR>
helium&nbsp; production&nbsp; and&nbsp; an operating agreement with =
Colorado Interstate<BR>
Gas Company for&nbsp; the&nbsp; sale&nbsp; of&nbsp; processed&nbsp; =
natural&nbsp; gas. The natural gas<BR>
liquids recovered by the plant are sold to various parties. (SOURCE: =

AB0UT&nbsp; THE&nbsp; C0MPANY:&nbsp; Turning&nbsp; carbon&nbsp; =
based&nbsp; materials into inexpensive<BR>
electrical and thermal energy: Here is the sizzle.<BR>
<BR>
Nathaniel Energy provides industry with an alternative energy =
comparable<BR>
to that&nbsp; of&nbsp; fossil&nbsp; fuels.&nbsp; Its&nbsp; =
proprietary&nbsp; patented&nbsp; technology, the<BR>
Thermal Combustor(TM), is a&nbsp; 2-stage&nbsp; gasification&nbsp; =
system&nbsp; designed&nbsp; to<BR>
combust&nbsp;&nbsp; waste,&nbsp; biomass,&nbsp; tires&nbsp; and&nbsp; =
any&nbsp; other&nbsp; solid,&nbsp; carbon-based<BR>
materials&nbsp; into&nbsp; inexpensive&nbsp;&nbsp; =
electrical&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp; thermal&nbsp; energy,&nbsp; while<BR>
exceeding&nbsp; the&nbsp; most&nbsp; stringent&nbsp; EPA&nbsp; and&nbsp; =
European&nbsp; Union&nbsp; regulations.<BR>

*Many of these St0cks are all about&nbsp; Beaucoup&nbsp; Bucks&nbsp; =

many micr0cap st0cks, t0day's c0mpany has additi0nal ri-sk fact0rs =
w0rth<BR>
n0ting.The c0mpany has a g0ing c0ncern 0pinion&nbsp; from&nbsp; =

exp-enses, has a large acc-umulated&nbsp; def'icit since its incepti0n =

need to<BR>
0btain fin'ancing. There can be no assu-rance of that happening. On =
July<BR>
2nd, the c0mpany announced it had terminated&nbsp; the&nbsp; =
Gasifier&nbsp; Supply&nbsp; and<BR>
Start-Up&nbsp; Ag'reement&nbsp; with&nbsp; L &amp; R Energy, LLC =
(&quot;L &amp; R&quot;), relating to the<BR>
supply of two 1800 BHP Thermal&nbsp; Combustors(TM) for a Refuse Derived =

pr0ject in Cologna Veneta, Italy.&nbsp; Nathaniel&nbsp; Energy&nbsp; =
be'lieves&nbsp; it&nbsp; has<BR>
0pportunities&nbsp; to&nbsp; place the two Thermal Combustors(TM),which =
were to be<BR>
delivered under the ag'reement, with other cust0mers, although it =
cannot<BR>
a'ssure that it will&nbsp; be&nbsp; able&nbsp; to&nbsp; reach&nbsp; any =
ag'reement to place these<BR>
Thermal Combustors(TM). On June 7,2004, Nathaniel Energy issued a&nbsp; =
press<BR>

Oklahoma<BR>
exp-erienced a fire, that there&nbsp; were&nbsp; no injuries, and that =
