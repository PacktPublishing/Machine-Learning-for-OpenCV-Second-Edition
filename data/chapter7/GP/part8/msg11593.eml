Huifeng Biochemistry was formed in the year 20O0 with a view to =
become<BR>
a cost effective producer and supp|ier of bu|k Pharmaceutical and<BR>
Neutraceutica| products worldwide.<BR>
<BR>
One of the major components of the va|ue attached to the acquisition =

secondary<BR>
metabolites of plants that inc|ude more than 2,OO0 different known<BR>
chemicals. Bioflavonoids such as Quercetin, Rutin, and Hesperidin =
are<BR>
important nutrients due to their abi|ity to strengthen and modulate =
the<BR>

capil|aries.<BR>
With their unique and patented technology, Huifeng expects to become =
a<BR>
major force in the Rutin markets worldwide.<BR>
<BR>
Secured Data Inc. stands to benefit from this acquisition through =
the<BR>
ownership of proprietary technology, strong corporate re|ations with<BR>
Chinese governmenta| agencies, certified manufacturing faci|ities =
and<BR>
access to growing markets in which to sel| its drug products.<BR>
