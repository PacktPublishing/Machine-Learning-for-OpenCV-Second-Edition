<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>SubPenny!!! and a WiMax.&nbsp; We love this =
combination...<BR>
Bringing Wireless Broadband Internet to the World<BR>
Ride the WiMAX wave now-or miss it<BR>
Stock Radar Presents,<BR>
WebSky, Inc.<BR>
OTC:WBSK<BR>
<BR>
The WiMAX bandwagon is rolling and this could be your LAST CHANCE to =
find a bargain-price in this sector.&nbsp;<BR>
So-listen up.<BR>
We have one for you to watch right now and its a subpenny!<BR>
<BR>
As I'm sure you know,<BR>
WiMAX does for the last mile of broadband what Wi-Fi has done for the =
last 100 feet of networking:<BR>
drop the price to the point at which it becomes a MUST-HAVE for the mass =
market.<BR>
FIVE BILLION people is the market.<BR>
<BR>
WebSky's business model involves providing wireless broadband internet =
service to underserved domestic and international markets. (Brilliant in =
our opinion)<BR>
<BR>
WBSK currently controls licensed radio frequencies in the highly sought =
after MMDS-band . 2.5GHz to 2.7GHz in seven small and medium sized =
cities in the United States, this frequency range will be used for =
wireless broadband Internet.<BR>
<BR>
Guess what?&nbsp; Read this.....<BR>
<BR>
WebSky, Inc. and World Wide Wireless -- India -- Enter into Definitive =
Joint Venture Agreement for Broadband Wireless Internet Project in =
India<BR>
<BR>
The joint venture anticipates the launch of its first operations in =
India during the second quarter of 2005. WebSky India projects, based on =
modest market penetration assumptions along with continuing robust =
growth of the Internet in India, that annual revenues for the three =
initial locations in the third year of operations will exceed $U.S. 45 =
million. (Partial clip only. This is major news for WBSK so you need to =
read it now.) Go to yahoo financial for the complete news.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Congratulations to all who participated in our first two picks of the =
year, nearly a double on the first one and the second gained over 120% =
Tue. Jan. 18th. and still going strong. WBSK is our third pick for the =
new year.<BR>
we are on a huge winning streak right now, so put WBSK on your radar's =
right now and start the WATCH immediately.&nbsp;<BR>
This company may prove to be our best pick yet!&nbsp; You never =
know..... Keep an eye out for more great news....<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So keep an eye tomorrow on WBSK and get in to ride the tsunami! Get in =
early while you can!<BR>
