<br>THE PARENT arrived back on the scene. She gave me a tape by Dr. =
Laura Meyers from UCLA. I listened to that tape eight times. I listened =
over and over and heard the same thing again and again. Ms. Meyers said, =
'These kids may need to hear a word many times (perhaps 72 times) before =
they ever say a word. A computer can be patient and say it the same way =
every time.' Now I understood. I was not patient enough. I did not allow =
the student to hear the words over and over. I was interrupting their =
learning by interjecting, when they were totally engrossed in what they =
were doing. I was asking questions they were not ready to answer. They =
were just learning language. They didn't have the answers yet.
<br>Minds are like parachutes. They only function when they are open.	=
