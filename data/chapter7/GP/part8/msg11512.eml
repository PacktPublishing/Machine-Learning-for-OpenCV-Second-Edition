future looking statements. Future |ooking statements are based on<BR>

that invo|ve a number of risks and uncertainties which could cause<BR>

risk<BR>
factors that raise doubt about its ability to continue as a going<BR>
concern. ANWM is not a reporting company registered under the Securities =

funding<BR>
requirements, and specifically, the Company's growth prospects with<BR>

acceptance,<BR>
the Company's use of licensed technologies, risk of increased<BR>
competition, the potential need for additional financing, the conditions =
and<BR>
terms of any financing that is consummated, the |imited trading market =

the Company's securities, the possible vo|atility of the Company's<BR>
