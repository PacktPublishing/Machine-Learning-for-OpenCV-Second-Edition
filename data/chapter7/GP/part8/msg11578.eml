<BR>
GILFORD, N.H., Dec 20, 2004 /PRNewswire-FirstCall via COMTEX/ -- =
iStorage Networks, Inc. (Pink Sheets: IOGN) announced today that it has =
been issued purchase orders valued at $90,000 (ninety thousand USD) for =
its network storage products.<BR>
<BR>
About iStorage Networks:<BR>
<BR>
iStorage Networks, Inc. develops and markets network storage solutions =
that are specifically designed for the small to medium business. =
Computer activity has obviously grown over the last few years, =
especially driven by electronic mail (e-mail). This demand is further =
propagated by digital photos, video files and new high image =
applications. Federal requirements for audit trails, medical records and =
as well as security, add to this acceleration for the need of network =
storage capacity. iStorage with its expertise and experience in the =
worldwide storage industry, coupled with its technology and channel =
partners, can deliver products that are simple to use and affordable to =
meet these needs.<BR>
<BR>
iStorage products utilize a new and emerging technology called iSCSI. =
ISCSI, is an IP (Internet Protocol) based standard for linking data =
storage devices over a network and transferring the users data. From the =
storage side, iSCSI uses the SCSI command set, the core storage commands =
used throughout all storage configurations. On the networking side, =
iSCSI uses IP and Ethernet, which are the basis for most corporate =
networks. This revolutionary technology utilizes a standard disk drive =
interface and Internet communications techniques, and provides an easy =
method for user's to manage data.<BR>
<BR>
The purchase orders have been issued through the company's International =
Resellers for projects in the automotive manufacturing and petrochemical =
refinery industry. &quot;These orders are the result of our efforts to =
date in developing the worldwide sales channel for our product =
offerings&quot;, said Roger Kirkland, VP Sales and Marketing for =
iStorage. He also added &quot;the company is well positioned to support =
the growing marketplace in the small to medium business sector.&quot; =
These orders are for immediate shipment<BR>
