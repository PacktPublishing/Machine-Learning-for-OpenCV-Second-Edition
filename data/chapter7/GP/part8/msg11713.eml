<p><font face=3D"Verdana" size=3D"2">John, a local football star, is =
jogging down
the street when he sees a building on fire.<br>
A lady is standing on a third story ledge holding her pet cat in her =
arms.</font>
<p><font face=3D"Verdana" size=3D"2">&quot;Hey, lady,&quot; yells John, =
&quot;Throw
me the cat.&quot;</font>
<p><font face=3D"Verdana" size=3D"2">&quot;No,&quot; she cries, =
&quot;It's too
far.&quot;</font>
<p><font face=3D"Verdana" size=3D"2">&quot;I play football, I can catch =
him.&quot;</font>
<p><font face=3D"Verdana" size=3D"2">The smoke is pouring from the =
windows, and
finally, the woman waves to John, kisses <br>
her cat goodbye, and tosses it down to the street.</font>
<p><font face=3D"Verdana" size=3D"2">John keeps his eye on the cat as it =
comes
hurtling down toward him. The feline <br>
bounces off an awning and John runs into the street to catch it. He =
jumps six
feet<br>
into the air and makes a spectacular one handed catch. The crowd that =
has
gathered<br>
to watch the fire breaks into cheers.<br>
<br>
John does a little dance, lifts the cat above his head, wiggles his =
knees back
and forth,<br>
then spikes the cat into the pavement.</font></p>
