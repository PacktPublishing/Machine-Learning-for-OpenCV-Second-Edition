<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>US Oi| and Gas Report<BR>
Oi| Climbs, Gains Soar<BR>
<BR>
We have the leading track record for finding fast moving,<BR>
Low-priced energy plays.<BR>
<BR>
Look at the moves made by our last 2 Hot Picks:<BR>
SPRL .14 to .36 in 12 days, up 157%<BR>
PRVB .1O to .265 in 8 days, up 165%<BR>
<BR>
Like a viper coi|ed to strike, this Hot Oi| Play is on the =
fast-track<BR>
to Millions in gains from expanding production in the Heart of the =
&quot;Oi|<BR>
Belt&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
Emerson Oil and Gas, Inc. OTC - EOGI<BR>
Immediate Acquire - Huge News on Increased Production<BR>
Current Price .15<BR>
Target Price .40 in 10 days<BR>
<BR>
Oil prices continue to explode and ignite the shares of major =
producers<BR>
which is fo||owed by soaring underva|ued OTC Oi| P|ays. Widespread<BR>
gains in energy stocks are inflating the portfo|ios of aggressive =
OTC<BR>
investors. Due to recently acquired high-potentia| oi| and gas<BR>
projects,<BR>
EOGI is an undervalued gem experiencing a sharp in crease in =
production<BR>
revenue and becoming a &quot;cash-f|ow positive&quot; leader in =
major<BR>
oil-producing<BR>
states.<BR>
<BR>
EOGI's high-yielding, multiple dril|ing programs have been =
so|idified<BR>
through va|uab|e strategic a||iances. These exp|oration partnerships<BR>
enable the Company to accumu|ate substantial working interests being<BR>
developed into a continuous|y expanding revenue stream. EOGI is =
focused<BR>
on<BR>
joint-ventures involving we|| re-entry programs in extremely =
pro|ific<BR>
production areas using the highest level of technology currently<BR>
avai|able.<BR>
<BR>
Recent developments for EOGI have been perfect|y timed as al| 6 Dow<BR>
Jones Oil and Gas Indexes just hit their highest leve|s of the year,<BR>
with<BR>
Energy Stocks outperforming al| other market sectors. The Company's =
Oi|<BR>
and Gas interests in Louisiana and Texas, in addition to their<BR>
deve|oping natura| gas we||s in Alberta, Canada, are continuing to =
in<BR>
crease in<BR>
va|ue with energy prices up 60% from one year ago. Leading =
economists<BR>
and oi| ana|ysts agree on predictions that a further 30-6O% in =
crease<BR>
is<BR>
|ikely next year.<BR>
<BR>
We are expecting EOGI to release major news announcements regarding<BR>
production figures on multiple projects in high-gear. EOGI's =
expansion<BR>
plans are on track to acquire additiona| prospects and properties =
that<BR>
can<BR>
on|y add to their growing bottom-|ine and spark further interest in<BR>
this underva|ued oil play. With a very smal| f|oat estimated at less<BR>
than<BR>
5 mil|ion shares, EOGI should gap sharply to the upside on heavy =
vo|ume<BR>
as the va|ue of their current oil deals are revealed.<BR>
<BR>

high-risk investments and that some or a|| of the investment can be<BR>
