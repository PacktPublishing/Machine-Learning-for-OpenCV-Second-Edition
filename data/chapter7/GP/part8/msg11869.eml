<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Dear Sir/Madam,<BR>
<BR>
I am Mr. Ibrahim Baaji (SAN) - an attorney of the Supreme Court of =
Nigeria. I am the personal attorney to Mr. Allen Zook, a national of =
United States, who worked with Shell Development Company of Nigeria =
in-charge of crude oil exploration, herein after referred to as my =
client.<BR>
<BR>
I came to know about you in my private search for a reliable =
person/company to handle a confidential transaction on my behalf and my =
colleagues.<BR>
On the 21st of October 2000, my client, his wife Valerie and their two =
children (Larry and Daren) died in an auto crash on one of Nigerian =
roads. Since then I have made several enquiries to the Embassy to locate =
any of my clients extended relatives without success. After several =
unsuccessful attempts, I decided to look for somebody abroad who is =
reliable and trustworthy I will forward as next of kin to receive his =
fund, hence I contacted you. I am contacting you to assist in claiming =
the money left behind by my client before the bank confiscates or =
declare the fund unserviceable.<BR>
<BR>
Until his death, my client had, and maintained a US Dollar currency =
deposit account with a closing balance of US$19.5M (Nineteen Million, =
Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) with a Trust Bank in North America, =
and have written us to recover all such dormant and unclaimed accounts =
to reinvest it with other funds through the capital market, but we have =
cleverly written and asked them to release the fund based on the =
instruction of the next of kin. It is for the urgency of this claim that =
I write to you to stand and receive the money as Mr. Allen's next of kin =
since I have failed in attempts in locating the relatives for over 2 =
years now. I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the =
deceased since I have perfectly procure all the vital documents that =
would aid the release of the money and forward it either to Europe or =
America whereby you will receive the money.<BR>
I am prepared to disburse the money among ourselves in the following =
ratio: Beneficiary/next of kin 30%, 5% for Bank and legal expenses, =
while my colleague and myself in the chambers shall have 65%.<BR>
<BR>
If this proposal is acceptable to you and you do not intend to take =
undue advantage of the trust we shall bestow on you, then kindly respond =
immediately, furnishing me with your confidential telephone and fax =
numbers. I have all necessary legal documents for the release of the =
fund. On indicating your willingness, I shall contact you for us to work =
out the modalities for you to receive the funds. All I require is your =
honesty and co-operation. I guarantee that this will be executed under =
legitimate arrangements that will protect you from any breach of the =
law.<BR>
<BR>
Yours faithfully,<BR>
<BR>
