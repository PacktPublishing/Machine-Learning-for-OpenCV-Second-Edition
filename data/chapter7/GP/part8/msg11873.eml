<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>My dearest in Christ,<BR>
May God be praised!!!<BR>
<BR>
I am Mrs. Fatima Iyesa Ismiana, from Kuwait.<BR>
I am married to Usman Ismiana of blessed memory who worked with =
Kuwait<BR>
embassy in Madrid Spain for nine years before he died in the year<BR>
2000.<BR>
<BR>
We were married for eleven years without a child he died after a =
brief<BR>
illness that lasted only four days. Before his death he was a very<BR>
devoted Muslim and I was a devoted Christian by birth battling with<BR>
both cancer and fibroid problems when my late husband was alive he<BR>
deposited the sum of $15million dollars (FIFTEEN million dollars)<BR>
with an overseas finance and security firm. Presently,this money is<BR>
still with finance and security firm. Recently, my doctor told me =
that<BR>
I had a terminating illness (cancer) that would last for the next =
four<BR>
months.<BR>
<BR>
Though what disturbs me most is my stroke sickness, having known<BR>
mycondition I decided to donate this fund to either a Christian<BR>
organization or a devoted Christian individual that will utilize<BR>
this money the way I am going to instruct here in. I want this<BR>
Christian organization or individual to use this money in all<BR>
sincerity to fund churches, orphanages, widows and also propagating<BR>
the word of God and to ensure that the society upholds the views<BR>
and beliefs of the holy bible.The holy bible emphasized so much on<BR>
the giving of alms,charity and this has encouraged me in taking this<BR>
bold step.<BR>
<BR>
I took this decision because I don't have any child to start from =
and<BR>
where I will stop and my husband's relatives are all Muslims and I<BR>
don't want my husband hard earned money to be misused by people that<BR>
call me an unbeliever.<BR>
<BR>
I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an unholy<BR>
manner hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I know that<BR>
after death I will be with God the most high and the most merciful<BR>
one. I don'tneed any telephone communications but will only give you<BR>
the contact of my lawyer Barr Brown Nelson.<BR>
<BR>
because he is the one who is going to assist you in making you the<BR>
beneficiary of the consignment in the finance and security firm.With<BR>
God, I know that all thing are possible and as soon as I receive =
your<BR>
reply through my lawyer I will now give him instruction to make you<BR>
the beneficiary of the consignment and all necessary steps to take<BR>
before receiving these funds and I shall also give you the contact<BR>
of the finance and security firm I will also issue you a letter of<BR>
authority that will prove you as the original beneficiary of the<BR>
funds.<BR>
<BR>
I want you and the Christian community where you reside toalways =
pray<BR>
for me.My happiness is that I lived a life of a true devoted =
Christian<BR>
though married to a Muslim, whoever that wants to serve God must =
serve<BR>
him in truth and in spirit, please always be prayerful all through<BR>
your life.<BR>
<BR>
Any dela y in your reply will give me room in sourcing for<BR>
anotherChristian organization or a devoted Christian for the same<BR>
purpose.Until I hear from you my dreams will rest squarely on your<BR>
shoulders,may the Almighty God continue to guide and protect you.<BR>
Amen.<BR>
<BR>
Yours faithfully,<BR>
Mrs. Fatima Iyesa Ismiana<BR>
