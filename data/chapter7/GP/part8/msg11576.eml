<BR><BR>Education is the ability to meet life's situations.<br><br>A =
man's life is interesting primarily when he has failed -- I well know. =
For it's a sign that he tried to surpass himself.



<BR><BR>A different world cannot be built by indifferent people.

<BR>How is the Empire?
One that does not think to highly of himself is more than he thinks.



<BR><BR>Hope and fear are inseparable.

An honest man's the noblest work of God.<br><br>Consciousness is much =
more than the thorn, it is the dagger in the flesh.
<br><br>Not by wrath does one kill, but by laughter.



<br><br>Mere flimflam stories, and nothing but shams and lies.



<BR><BR>The most important thing a father can do for his children is to =
love their mother.

<br>Love laughs at locksmiths.



<br>The pursuit of happiness is a most ridiculous phrase if you pursue =
happiness you'll never find it.



<BR><BR>No man can worship God or love his neighbor on an empty stomach.


<BR>Quick to borrow is always slow to pay.<br><br>What you see, but =
can't see over is as good as infinite.<BR>I'm still an artist. I'm never =
gonna do a shit movie, because I've got my modeling to support =
me.<BR><BR>If you have to be in a soap opera try not to get the worst =
role.<BR><A =
