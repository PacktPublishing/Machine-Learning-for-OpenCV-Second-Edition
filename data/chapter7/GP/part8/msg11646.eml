in todays Energy market. The companys shares trade on the NQB (ticker =

Sourcing Domestic 0i| and Gas is Bushs #1 priority and, therefore, the =

this hotbed of activity.<BR>

With the Board's background and expertise , this renaissance into a pure =
oi| and gas p|ay was natural.<BR>
The Companys other ho|dings are being considered as spin-off and/or =
merger &amp; acquisition candidates.<BR>
Management plans to file a Form 1O in the immediate future.<BR>
