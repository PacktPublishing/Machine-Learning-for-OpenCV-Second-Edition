ATTN:Director/CEO,<BR>
<BR>
I am Mr John Zuma, the General manager of Alert Security (pty) ltd, =
South<BR>
Africa. Our firm is a security company of high repute with =
outstanding<BR>
service to the people of Africa.<BR>
<BR>
I have resolved to contact you through this medium based on business<BR>
proposal that will be of mutual benefit to both of us. I have not =
discussed<BR>
this transaction with anybody because it is secrecy. To be explicit =
and<BR>
straight to the point, some time early 1997, a reputable client =
deposited a<BR>
consignment in our security company, vault for safekeeping. And since =
then<BR>
our client has failed to come forward to claim his consignment, which =
has<BR>
accumulated a considerable amount of money in demurrage.<BR>
<BR>
Consequently, in our bide to contact this client to redeem the =
demurrage<BR>
which the consignment had Accumulated, we discovered that our client was =
the<BR>
former president of the federal Republic of Zaire, who died of illness =
after<BR>
he was dethroned in the same year, the consignment was entrusted into =
our<BR>
care.<BR>
<BR>
Since the death of our client President Mobutu SeseSeko, none of his<BR>
relatives or aids had any knowledge of this consignment. Hence out =
of<BR>
curiosity, I decided to secretly open the two boxes that our client<BR>
deposited in our vault. And to my surprise, I discovered that the two =
boxes<BR>
that were registered as treasure by our client actually contained a<BR>
considerable amount of money in United States Dollars amounting to =
about<BR>
[US$40.5M] dollars. Since this development I have been nursing plans<BR>
secretly.<BR>
<BR>
I also found out from enquiries and the foreign media that our late =
clients<BR>
siphoned a lot of money from his country when he was in office as head =
of<BR>
state. It is my conviction that the consignment in our vault was part of =
the<BR>
money that our client siphoned, and now that he is dead there is no =
trace to<BR>
this money and that is why I want to transfer this money out of South =
Africa<BR>
to your country for immediate investment with your assistance.<BR>
<BR>
I have also decided that you will generously be entitled to 35% of the =
total<BR>
amount, if you assist me in this transaction. I will immediately arrange =
and<BR>
transfer all the right of owner ship of this consignment to your name, =
to<BR>
facilitate your easy clearance and transfer of the complete funds to =
your<BR>
country for onward investment. This transaction is 100% risk free.<BR>
<BR>
Please maintain absolute confidentiality on this matter. I await your =
most<BR>
prompt response through my mobile number or e- mail: above.<BR>
<BR>
Yours faithfully<BR>
<BR>
Mr John Zuma<BR>
General Manager<BR>
<BR>
