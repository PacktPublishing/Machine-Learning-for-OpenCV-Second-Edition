{URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL)<BR>
(RE: TRANSFER OF ($ 52,000.000.00 USD)<BR>
FIFTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS<BR>
<BR>
Dear sir,<BR>
<BR>
We want to transfer to overseas ($ 52,000.000.00USD) Fifty two million =
United<BR>
StatesDollars) from a Bank in Africa, I want to ask you to quietly =
look<BR>
for a reliable and honest person who will be capable and fit to =
provide<BR>
either an existing bank account or to set up a new Bank a/c =
immediately<BR>
to receive this money, even an empty a/c can serve to receive this =
money,<BR>
as long as you will remain honest to me till the end for this =
important<BR>
business trusting in you and believing in God that you will never let =
me<BR>
down either now or in future.<BR>
I am MR Francis Joseph the Auditor General of a bank in Africa, during =
the<BR>
course of our auditing, I discovered a floating fund in an account =
opened<BR>
in the bank in 1990 and since 1993 nobody has operated on this account =
again,<BR>
after going through some old files in the records I discovered that =
the<BR>
owner of the account died without a [heir] hence the money is floating =
and<BR>
if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for =
nothing.<BR>
The owner of this account is Mr. Arthur Coleman , a foreigner, and an =
Industrialist,<BR>
who died since 1993 and no other person knows about this account or =
anything<BR>
concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and my =
investigation<BR>
proved to me as well that Arthur Coleman until his death was the =
manager<BR>
of Coleman Coy.(pty). SA. We will start the first transfer with two =
six<BR>
million [$26,000.000] upon successful transaction without any =
disappointment<BR>
from your side, we shall re-apply for the payment of the remaining =
amount<BR>
to your account.The amount involved is (USD 52M) Fifty two million =
United<BR>
States Dollars only. I want to first transfer $26,000.000 [ two six =
million<BR>
United States Dollars from this money into a safe foreigners account =
abroad<BR>
before the rest, but I don't know any foreigner, I am only contacting =
you<BR>
as a foreigner because this money can not be approved to a local =
person<BR>
here, without valid international foreign passport, but can only be =
approved<BR>
to a foreigner with valid international passport or drivers license =
and<BR>
foreign a/c because the money is in US DOLLARS and the former owner of =
the<BR>
a/c Mr. Arthur Coleman is a foreigner too, [and the money can only be =
approved<BR>
into a foreign a/c. However, we will sign a binding agreement, to bind =
us<BR>
together. I got your contact address from my Secretary who operates =
computer.<BR>
I am revealing this to you with believe in God that you will never let =
me<BR>
down in this business, you are the first and the only person that I am =
contacting<BR>
for this business, so please reply urgently so that I will inform you =
on<BR>
the next step to take urgently. Send also your private telephone and =
fax<BR>
numbers including the full details of the account to be used for the =
deposit.<BR>
I want us to meet face to face to build confidence and to sign a =
binding<BR>
agreement that will bind us together before transferring the money to =
any<BR>
account of your choice where the fund will be safe before we fly to =
your<BR>
country for withdrawal, sharing and investments. I need your full =
co-operation<BR>
to make this work fine because the management is ready to approve this =
payment<BR>
to any foreigner who has correct information of this account, which I =
will<BR>
give to you, upon your positive response and once I am convinced that =
you<BR>
are capable and will meet up with instructions of a key bank official =
who<BR>
is deeply involved with me in this business. I need your strong =
assurance<BR>
that you will never,never let me down. With my influence and the =
position<BR>
of the bank official, we can transfer this money to any foreigner's =
reliable<BR>
account which you can provide with assurance that this money will be =
intact<BR>
pending our physical arrival in your country for sharing. The bank =
official<BR>
will destroy all documents of transaction immediately we receive this =
money<BR>
leaving no trace to any place and to build onfidence you can come =
immediately<BR>
to discuss with me face to face after which I will make this =
remittance<BR>
in your presence and three of us will fly to your country at least two =
days<BR>
ahead of the money going into the account.I will apply for annual =
leave<BR>
to get visa immediately I hear from you that you are ready to act and =
receive<BR>
this fund in your account. I will use my position and influence to =
obtain<BR>
all legal approvals for onward transfer of this money to your account =
with<BR>
appropriate clearance from the relevant ministries and foreign =
exchange<BR>
departments. At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 35% =
of<BR>
the total amount, 60% will be for me, while 5% will be for expenses =
both<BR>
parties might have incurred during the process of transfering.<BR>
<BR>
I look forward to your earliest reply : francis0j@emailpinoy.com<BR>
<BR>
Yours,<BR>
<BR>
