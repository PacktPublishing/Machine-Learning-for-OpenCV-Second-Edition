<BR>
Kindly accept my apology for sending unsolicited mail to you. Although =
we never met before, I have every reason to believe that you are a =
highly respected personality considering the fact that I sourced your =
profile from a human database on your country.Though, I do not know to =
what extent you are familiar with event and fragile political situation =
in Liberia but it has formed consistent headline in the CNN, BBC news =
bulletins, my name is Dr.leonard rado,from Liberia, a country in West =
Africa. Formal Finance minister in Liberia.<BR>
<BR>
Since the president (Charles Taylor) was removed from office and the =
Security Council on March 16th 2004 shot listed my name as one of the =
higher Government officials close to the president (Charles Taylor) and =
impose traveling ban on me with other close associate. You can as well =
check on the webpage provided below:<BR>
<A =
HREF=3D"http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/committees/Liberia3/1521_list.htm">http=
://www.un.org/Docs/sc/committees/Liberia3/1521_list.htm</A><BR>
During the political crisis as a Finance Minister I secretly deposited =
one trunk box tag as DIPLOMATIC ITEM OF HIGH VALUE with a security and =
Finance company in abroad, (name withheld for security reasons).All the =
legal Documents of the Deposit is right here with me.<BR>
<BR>
Presently, I have nothing with me because the present Government has =
seized all my account and I&#8217;m now left with this box Deposited in =
a Security Company. My decision to contact you is therefore, inform by =
this and due to my present social, political statue and total ignorance =
of business in the western World. I believe you will appreciate the =
enormity of trust I repose on you by placing the fortunes of our family =
in your care.<BR>
<BR>
Permit me to request that you should reassure me that you would not let =
me down in any way. On my part&#8217; this is my assurance and guarantee =
to you. In as much as you follow my instructions carefully. Religiously =
and promptly my guarantee of a hitch-free success remains unshakable. I =
have contacted the Security and Finance Company to confirm the deposit, =
which worth Twenty Five Million United State Dollars ($25Million =
Dollars)<BR>
<BR>
You will be given 20% of the total sum at the end of the transaction and =
5% for any expense you incure during the process of clearance. If you =
will be willing to assist me claim the money and invest it in a =
profitable business venture in your country. I want to assure you that =
all modalities are in place and it is risk free transaction. For =
security reasons I don&#8217;t want to talk about this transaction on =
phone until the tension of this traveling restriction is over. Every =
correspondence should be forwarded to this EMAIL: =
leonardrado200@netscape.net by this time.<BR>
<BR>
This proposal is highly restricted and should be handle as an urgent =
transaction requiring trust and confidentiality.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks while looking forward to hearing from you soonest.<BR>
<BR>
My kindest regards,<BR>
<BR>
