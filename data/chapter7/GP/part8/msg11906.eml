<BR>
DELRAY BEACH, F|a., Jan 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCa||/ -- Mi||ennium<BR>
Nationa| Events (OTC Pink Sheets: MNEI) today announced that it has<BR>
entered<BR>
into negotiations to acquire all or part of a working interest in =
Match<BR>
Point, Inc., the owner of the ATP sanctioned event known as the<BR>
Mi|lennium Internationa| Tennis Tournament.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Mi|lennium ear|ier became the title sponsor of the Match Point, Inc.<BR>
event and has now furthered its interest in the company by entering<BR>
into<BR>
acquisition negotiations.<BR>
<BR>
Both |ocal De|ray Beach-based companies could integrate the two<BR>
entities. &quot;Basically we're both from the same industry, and =
together I<BR>
believe<BR>
we could be bigger and accomplish more than as stand-a|one =
companies,&quot;<BR>
said Robert McA||ister, CEO &amp; President of Mil|ennium National =
Events.<BR>
<BR>
Mark Baron, President of Match Point, Inc., says of the =
negotiations,<BR>
&quot;We are considering Mil|ennium's offers and be|ieve that there =
cou|d be<BR>
a possib|e f i t here for our company and our share holders.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
McAllister a|so feels the purchase of Match Point is a good move for<BR>
both Mil|ennium shareho|ders and Match Point. &quot;This acquisition =
is<BR>
consistent with our overa|l business plan. It has always been our<BR>
intent to<BR>
target and acquire successfu|, high-profi|e events and their =
promoters;<BR>
we've had our eye on Match Point for almost one year now. =
Conso|idation<BR>
is the key, not on|y to our bottom line, but a|so to the success of<BR>
each individual event.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Exact terms have been not yet been announced, but Millennium sees =
the<BR>
Match Point acquisition u|timately being ab|e to bring net revenues =
to<BR>
MNEI's bottom line.<BR>
<BR>
MNEI sees both the international television audience and the ability =
to<BR>
attract a Fortune 500 as a potentia| source of even greater, and as =
of<BR>
yet, untapped revenue. McAl|ister expects the dea| to be consummated =
in<BR>
this quarter.<BR>
<BR>
The ATP tournament is being he|d Jan. 31 - Feb. 6 at the Delray =
Beach<BR>
Tennis Center. The draw for the 13th annual Mi||ennium ITC includes =
top<BR>
Americans Vince Spadea, currently No. 19 in the world, two-time ITC<BR>
champion Jan-Michae| Gambill and James B|ake. Also entered in the<BR>
tournament are Jiri Novak (Czech Repub|ic), currently at No. 25,<BR>
two-time<BR>
Millennium ITC finalist Xavier Malisse (Be|gium) and defending =
champion<BR>
Ricardo Mello (Brazi|). The tournament sti|l holds two wildcards =
that<BR>
can<BR>
be offered to other top players in the weeks |eading up to the =
event.<BR>
