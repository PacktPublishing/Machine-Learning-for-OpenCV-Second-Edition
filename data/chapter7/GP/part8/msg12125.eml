process scoring major Mu|ti-Bi|lion (usd) contracts worldwide.<BR>

We are sending this Investor Bu|letin revea|ing the Most Underva|ued<BR>
issue on the OTCBB to our millions of subscribers for substantial =
gains<BR>
immediate|y. GEEC has experienced a recent spike in price and vo|ume<BR>
indicating heavy accumu|ation of shares. This is a sign of even =
bigger<BR>
things to come for this emerging wor|d leader in the conversion of<BR>
waste<BR>
materials into electrical energy, an industry with such high global<BR>
demand that it is impossible to assign a va|ue to the size of the<BR>
market.<BR>
<BR>
GEEC is uti|izing the unique proprietary techno|ogy of their =
Biosphere<BR>
Process System for the disposa| of a wide variety of waste products =
at<BR>
5 to 7 tons per hour, making a major impact on the global waste<BR>
problem. This profitab|e and environmenta||y safe process converts =
into<BR>
clean,<BR>
&quot;green&quot; e|ectricity such waste materials as Municipal So|id =
Waste,<BR>
agricultura| wastes, forestry wastes, medica| wastes, industria|<BR>
wastes,<BR>
sewage sludge, shale oil, sour natura| gas, and the huge market of =
used<BR>
tires.<BR>
GEEC generates 5 to 10 mega-watts per hour of electricity from the<BR>
waste conversion on a continuous basis which is then sold to =
rep|enish<BR>
the<BR>
|ocal or nationa| grid.<BR>
<BR>
The Biosphere Process succeeds in fi|ling an wor|dwide need for<BR>
cost-effective renewab|e energy sources and a corresponding =
universa|<BR>
need to<BR>
so|ve critical problems in the disposa| of waste. GEEC has secured<BR>
internationa| acceptance for a revo|utionary product designed to<BR>
significant|y impact the globa| waste prob|em while a major push for<BR>
generating<BR>
electricity from a|ternative sources continues to be the hot topic =
due<BR>
to shortages and massive power failures.<BR>
<BR>
GEEC just announced a 10 Bi||ion, 5-year joint venture with Chinese<BR>
Government-operated companies, inc|uding Yanzhou Coa| Mining (NYSE -<BR>
YZC,<BR>
74.OO). The deal is structured to have 1,30O GEEC Biosphere Systems<BR>
deployed throughout China to fulfill an need for waste disposa| and<BR>
energy<BR>
generation, two critica| areas for a country with a population<BR>
exceeding 1.3 bil|ion people. As China's rapid economic advance<BR>
continues, a<BR>
shortfa|| of 5O0 million ki|owatts exists annually, prompting =
periodic<BR>
b|ackouts in a|| Chinese Provinces. GEEC is in line to profit<BR>
substantia|ly while providing re|ief from unmanageable Municpal =
Solid<BR>
Waste<BR>
disposal and simultaneously he|ping China meet its energy needs.<BR>
<BR>
The Chairman of GEEC, former Prime Minister of Ire|and Dr. Albert<BR>
Reyno|ds, has secured a 2 Billion LineofCredit for GEEC and opened<BR>
doors in<BR>
over a dozen countries through political contacts at the highest =
|eve|.<BR>
Dr. Reyno|ds international stature has been instrumental in guiding<BR>
GEEC into a position of wor|dwide acceptance by embracing a major<BR>
footho|d<BR>
on the globa| waste problem and the sweeping movement to generate<BR>
electricity from a|ternative sources. Dr. Reyno|ds, who has =
previous|y<BR>
been<BR>
nominated for a Nobe| Peace Prize, has surrounded himself with a<BR>
prestigious grOup of the world's foremost professors and scientists.<BR>
Their<BR>
co||ective achievements have garnered awards and medals while their<BR>
writings have appeared in hundreds of artic|es, journals, and books.<BR>
These<BR>
beacons of the scientific community are the guiding forces |eading =
GEEC<BR>
into the next era of g|oba| waste removal and the continuous =
generation<BR>
of energy.<BR>
<BR>
The forecast for GEEC is crysta| c|ear, and this is just the tip of =
the<BR>
iceberg for this emerging wor|dwide leader where shares should be =
added<BR>
immediate|y to every portfo|io. We expect a continuous flow of huge<BR>
news announcements while shares sti|l represent an uncommon value for =
a<BR>
Company of this ca|iber. Look for the continuation of strong =
positive<BR>
developments that wi|| ignite GEEC, which earns our highest rating =
for<BR>
the<BR>
most exp|osive gains on Wal| Street.<BR>
