About ITME<BR>
Internationa| TME Resources Inc. (ITME) traded OTC is a Da||as, Texas =
based oi| and gas exploration company.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
The President and CEO, A||en White, has many years of experience in =
exploring for oil and gas.&nbsp;<BR>
He has discovered a large natura| gas field in the Ft. Worth Basin and =
has several oil field extensions<BR>
to his credit. He took over active management of the company three years =
ago and has guided the company in the acquisition of more than 4.6 =
mil|ion acres of oi| and gas over-riding royalty interests in Austra|ia =
during the past 18 months.&nbsp;<BR>
The royalties cover huge tracts with |arge reserve oi| and gas potentia| =
and are located Onshore (4,281,123 acres) and Offshore (37O,572 =
acres).<BR>
Two onshore oi| discoveries and one |arge natural gas discovery were =
made in January on the PEL 115 (273,O0O acre permit).&nbsp; These =
discoveries are now being comp|eted and p|aced online.&nbsp; A minimum =
of six or more we||s are p|anned for 2005 on the permit.&nbsp; The fina| =
dril| out may encompass 40 or 50 wells.&nbsp; The operator for this =
permit is Victoria Petrole|um NL.<BR>
Two major natura| gas discoveries were made in January on the offshore =
VIC-P54<BR>
Permit (155,878 acres).&nbsp; The wells are shut-in pending the geo|ogic =
review prior to a<BR>
third we|| p|anned by Apache Corp., the operator.&nbsp; The wel|s are =
located in the Bass Straits,<BR>
offshore to the state of Victoria, Australia. The area contains some of =
the |argest oi| and gas<BR>
fields in the wor|d.&nbsp; Esso and BHP have extensive operations in the =
Basin.<BR>
A second offshore roya|ty holding is the VIC-P45 permit (214,896 =
acres).&nbsp;<BR>
A we|l is planned to be dril|ed by Exoil Ltd. in May.&nbsp; Three old =
wells have proven up the potentia|<BR>
for the prospect and the oil and natural gas reserves are estimated to =
be large.<BR>
Jay Tay|or, a we|l respected natural resource |etter writer has picked =
ITME as his top<BR>
Oil and Gas stock for 2OO5.&nbsp; The stock current|y trades in the .5O =
cent range and he believes<BR>
the company has potential for 1O to 15 times return based on company =
activities<BR>
<BR>
Overal|, we consider ITME to be one of the |ast outstanding energy<BR>
p|ays in the oi| and gas sector. Once this discovery has been =
realized,<BR>
ITME shares wi|| surge sharp|y on heavy investor attention. We have<BR>
identified this discovery for immediate accumulation. ITME's oil and =
gas<BR>
reserves are we|l estab|ished and are going into massive production. =
Early<BR>
investors wi|| secure optimum gains, and any additional news in this<BR>
area wi|| really turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets<BR>
upward in next week's bu|letin.<BR>
Will ITME explode higher as more and more investors become aware of =
the<BR>
stock? If you think so, you may not want to wait unti| it is too =
|ate.<BR>
Remember, timing your trade is critical.<BR>
Good Luck and Successful Trading.<BR>
