You can grab music, like full CD albums, and games &amp; movies.&nbsp; =
Ive downloaded 3 dvd's so far.<BR>
You have to check out how many things they have in here to download - =
it's out of this world.<BR>
Theres a section on every page that shows you how to burn the movies =
&amp; music and games<BR>
I'm looking at the movie sections over lunch, they have movies in here =
that are still in theaters - it's nuts.<BR>
I'll talk to you soon.<BR>
