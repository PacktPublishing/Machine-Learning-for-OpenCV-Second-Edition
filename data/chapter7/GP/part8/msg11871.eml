the retrieving and managment of our inherittance.<BR>

We are Ibrahim and Mariam Gwarzo from Cote d'Ivoire we lost our parents =
a couple of years ago .our father was a wealthy cocoa farmer and later =
was appointed as the chairman of cocoa exporting Group of Cote d'Ivoire =
until his death they was assacineted by the rebels during the political =
problem in my country in the year 2002<BR>

told me was for the importation of Cocoa processing equipments for the =
establishment of his cocoa processing plant in Abidjan.<BR>

and took all that belong of our late parents and we have to run to our =
mother's village which is where we are writing you from now.<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
We request your assistance to transfer this (Fifteen Million Dollars) =
$15Million in your private bank account,we will compensate you with 15 % =

money.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
