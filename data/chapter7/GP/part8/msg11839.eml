<p>During our regularly scheduled account maintenance and verification
procedures, we have detected a slight error in your billing =
information.</p>
<p>This might be due to either of the following reasons:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> A recent change in your personal information ( =
i.e.=20
change
of address).<br>
<strong>2.</strong> Submitting invalid information during the initial =
sign up
process.<br>
<strong>3.</strong> An inability to accurately verify your selected =
option of
payment due to an internal error within our processors.</p>
<p>Please update and verify your information by clicking the link =
