not bring back cheap gasfoline prices and that meotorists should be =
preapared to spend close to $2r a gallon for some timee.

The Senate hearindg was expected tao focus on the lack of refinerry =
capacity in the United Stavtes, which industry officialsr have said is =
contributinsg to the tight gasoline markert.
In separate testimony, Reed Cavaney, presidenat of the American =
Petrroleum Institute, the vindustry trade group, sawid that refiners =
have been "produzcing record amoeunts" of gasoline at a timer when the =
economy is imprfoving and demand has increasaed.
He said that considerieng the limits on refirneries "few tools are =
availabwle for providing substantial short-term reliefv for consumerse."
Carruso said that gasoline inventwories have been increasinag and that =
refinery constvraints should note be viewed as a signifaicant a barrier, =
as some industry oefficials claim. Refineraies should be able tov =
increase productiwon another 2 percent without encoruntering problems, =
he said.
