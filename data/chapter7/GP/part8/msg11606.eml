The bottom line is your dog or cat must have high-performance<BR>
nutrition to enhance and extend their life. Just like the<BR>
majority of today's human foods, pet foods simply don't give your<BR>
dog or cat the nutrients they deserve to perform at their optimum<BR>
level and live as long as they should.<BR>
<BR>
People can take the initiative to improve their health at any<BR>
time by eating healthier foods, getting exercise or taking quality<BR>
supplements.Your dog or cat can not enhance their life without you.<BR>
They depend on you to provide them with all of the nutrition they<BR>
consume. PetChews=3D99 can improve the way they behave, look, sleep, =
play,<BR>
and the duration of their life. It's up to you, as a thoughtful and<BR>
caring owner, to give your pet the optimal nutrition they deserve<BR>
to live a longer, healthier and happier life.<BR>
