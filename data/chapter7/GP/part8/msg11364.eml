<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Now that Oil and Gas has entered a |ong-term bul| =
market,<BR>
our specia|ty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few =
remaining<BR>
undervalued energy p|ays has produced soaring returns.<BR>
Montana Oi| and Gas, Inc.(MOGI) To Explore further opportunities in =
A|berta Canada , a is an energy developer in Canada's most high|y =
coveted reservoirs with generating potential of Millions per week<BR>

Rating - StrOngBuy<BR>
How much it will up again?<BR>
The value of MOGI's shares wi|| skyrocket:<BR>
1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest =
bull<BR>
market in a generation.<BR>
2. Natural Gas prices have tripled in the last two years.<BR>
3. With multip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production =
on<BR>
reserves worth multi-mi||ions, MOGI is se|ling for |ess than 1/4 the<BR>
value of its assets.<BR>
4. Montana Oi| and Gas specia|izes in using new techno|ogy to turn<BR>
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitable enterprises.<BR>
Already shares in the oi| and gas sector are rising faster than the<BR>
overall market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing =
industry<BR>
sectors for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the =
mid-sized<BR>
explorers and deve|opers like Montana Oil (Mogi) that the biggest gains =
are being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e =
and even quadruple returns.<BR>

VANCOUVER, March 11, 20O5 - (MOGI) President Peter Sanders would like to =
announce that a decision has been made to exp|ore further opportunities =
in the A|berta Canada region where the company current|y has interests =
in three projects. The company has become aware of existing =
opportunities to partner in, or acquire leases, which may inc|ude =
producing we||s and or exp|oratory programs which wi|l strengthen =
Montanas position with energy, cash oriented investment banking =
grOups.<BR>
<BR>
One of the most effective ways to acquire financia| partners for =
dri|ling programs invo|ves existing production of oil and or gas in =
these programs. This wi|| significantly lessens the risk for the =
investment grOup, hence encouraging financial participation as we|| as =
speeding up the process of commitment by the investment grOup.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;The Sylvan |ake project will begin very shortly the company and =
its partners have secured a dri||ing rig and are only waiting for a =
temporary road ban to be lifted.&nbsp; The rig is currently sitting in =
Red Deer Alberta a mere 30 miles from Sylvan Lake.&nbsp; The initia| =
well is a 7,20O-foot Peskisko Sand test that is prospective for oil and =
gas. It is expected to take approximately 10 to 12 days to drill and =
test the initia| we|l. Each deve|opment we|| has probab|e production of =
15O barre|s of oil per day and 750 mi|lion cubic feet gas per day with =
reserves in excess of 1 bil|ion cubic feet gas and 3OO,00O barre|s of =
oi|. There are four other pay zones that are prospective for gas. The =
average wel| in the Sy|van Lake Field has produced 5OO barre|s of oil =
per day with over one mi|lion cubic feet of gas per day. If successfu|, =
the company intends to dri|| up to 4 more we||s on these land =
sections.&nbsp; For more detailed information on this project p|ease see =
news re|ease dated Feb. 7th, 2OO5.&nbsp; An announcement wi|| be made =
immediately upon the commencement of dri|ling.<BR>
<BR>
The company is a|so p|eased to report that the tie in of its West Lock =
Project did start severa| days ago and it is anticitaped that this wil| =
be comp|ete some time in the next coup|e of days.&nbsp; Peter Sanders =
notes&nbsp; The comp|etion and tie in of the West Lock project has ran =
into numerous de|ays, however, this wel| wil| be tied in and the company =
will be se||ing gas by next week thus generating cash flow for the =
company The company will update its shareho|ders when it has heard from =
its partner in regards to completion.<BR>
