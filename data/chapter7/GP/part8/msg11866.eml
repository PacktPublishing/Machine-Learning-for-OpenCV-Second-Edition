I am,( Head of Group Risk) Bankers Trust International&nbsp;&nbsp; =
London, England. Between 31st July, 1999/Jan. 12th 2000, one Mr. Andreas =
Schranner, a German national, a property magnate, made&nbsp; series of =
(Fixed) Deposit, valued at #2,550,000.00 (Two&nbsp; Million, Five =
Hundred and Fifty Thousand Pounds) in my Bank branch, upon maturity and =
as would be required, we sent a routine notification to his forwarding =
address but got no response. After a month, we became apprehensive and =
sent a reminder. Finally we discovered from his company that Mr. Andreas =
Schranner was aboard the ill fated AF4590 plane, which crashed Monday, =
31 July, 2000 into the Hotelissimo.<BR>

bc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm</A>)<BR>
After further investigation, it was discovered that he died without =
making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin proved abortive =
and futile. As a matter of fact and on further investigation, it was =
discovered that Late Mr. Andreas Schranner did not declare any next of =
kin or relatives in all his official documents, including his Bank =
Deposit paper work here in our Bank. This Fund is still in my bank and =
the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of =
each year. No one will ever and has come forward to lay claim to it. In =
strict accordance with the British banking laws and constitution, at the =
expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the British =
Government Treasury if nobody applies as the next of Kin to claim the =
funds. All I need from you is to play the role as next of Kin,&nbsp; the =
Bank will work with verifiable documents which I have .Upon acceptance =
of this proposal, I shall send to you the Bankers Trust =
International&nbsp;&nbsp; Banks &quot;Next of Kin Payment Application =
Form&quot; as well as detailed information on how this transaction would =
be carried out. We shall employ the services of a solicitor for the =
drafting of the LAST WILL &amp; TESTAMENT of Late Mr. Andreas Schranner =
and to obtain all other relevant papers in your name for the necessary =
documentation for payment approval in your favor. I did my homework =
thoroughly and very well before contacting you.<BR>
I am open for negotiation on your Terms. I guarantee that this will be =
executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any =
breach of the law as I will use my official&nbsp;&nbsp; position and =
capacity to secure approvals and guarantee the successful execution of =
this transaction.<BR>
Please be informed that your utmost confidentiality is required. If this =
interests you, please, indicate by responding with your<BR>
Contact details.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks.<BR>
Best regards,<BR>
