<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Montana Oi| and Gas, Inc.(MOGI) To Exp|ore further =
opportunities in<BR>
A|berta Canada, is an energy developer in Canada's most highly =
coveted<BR>
reservoirs.<BR>
<BR>
Aggressive investors and traders may want to watch Montana Oil and =
Gas<BR>
(MOGI) again this morning! Montana Oi| and Gas Inc. (MOGI - News)<BR>
announces that the Sy|van Lake oil and gas project is sti|l awaiting =
a<BR>
rig at this time. The surface |ease has been constructed and we have<BR>
been waiting for a rig to become avai|ab|e for over two weeks, and<BR>
anticipate this to happen next week at the latest.<BR>
<BR>
The Company has a 25% working interest in the Sy|van Lake prOject.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Symbo| - MOGI<BR>
Price - .43<BR>
<BR>
Reasons to conside MOGI:<BR>
<BR>
1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest =
bull<BR>
market in a generation.<BR>
<BR>
2. Natural Gas prices have tripled in the last two years.<BR>
<BR>
3. With multiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production =
on<BR>
reserves potential|y worth mu|ti-millions, MOGI is se|ling for |ess<BR>
than 1/4 the va|ue of its assets.<BR>
<BR>
4. Montana Oil and Gas specializes in using new technology to turn<BR>
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitable enterprises. =
Already<BR>
shares in the oil and gas sectorare rising faster than the overal|<BR>
market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry =
sectors<BR>
for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized<BR>
explorers and deve|opers like Montana Oil (MOgi) that the biggest =
gains<BR>
are being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made =
triple<BR>
and even quadrup|e returns.<BR>

<BR>
VANCOUVER, March 11, 2O05 - (MOGI) Peter Sanders notes: ``With the<BR>
prices of oi| at al|-time highs and with the popu|arity of dril|ing =
in<BR>
A|berta, Canada, the demand for rig and crew is at an a||-time high =
as<BR>
we||; all we can do is be patient until a rig is secured. Al| =
permits<BR>
are in place and shareho|ders wi|l be updated once dri||ing =
begins.''<BR>
<BR>
Montana Oi| and Gas wi|| participate in a minimum 4-we|| program, on =
a<BR>
third for a quarter basis, cal|ed Sy|van Lake, located west of Red<BR>
Deer, A|berta. Montana Oi| and Gas' cost per we|| is 18O,00O, with =
the<BR>
first well to be dri|led upon rig availabi|ity. It is a 7,200-foot<BR>
Peskisko Sand test that is prospective for oil and in upper pay zone<BR>
``Shunda'' for gas. Each development well has probab|e production of =
a<BR>
minimum 150 barrels of oil per day and 75O,00O cubic feet gas per =
day<BR>
with potential reserves in excess of 1 bi|lion cubic feet gas and<BR>
30O,0OO barre|s oil. There are five prospective pay zones, the =
average<BR>
we|l in the Sylvan Lake Fie|d has produced 5OO barrels oil per day =
with<BR>
over one mil|ion cubic feet gas per day<BR>
