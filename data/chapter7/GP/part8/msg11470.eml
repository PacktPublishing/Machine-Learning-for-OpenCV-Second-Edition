Native Visions Inc. for Marketing Into Native American Businesses and =
Casinos<BR>
Friday January 28, 8:59 pm ET<BR>
<BR>
Native Visions has been working with tribes since 1998 and is a valuable =
liaison between the government and Tribal entities. They are closely =
connected with Native American businesses and Casinos on Tribal lands. =
Native Visions Inc.'s core competency is in structuring finances and =
economic development for tribal enterprises. Casey Hall, CEO of SYGG is =
quoted as saying, &quot;Native Visions is a key partner in expanding our =
business and technology into the Tribal Community and we look forward to =
a long and profitable relationship.&quot; (It doesn't take a rocket =
scientists to figure this one out folks.&nbsp; Who owns a ton of casinos =
all over the country?&nbsp; The Indians!&nbsp; Who needs more =
surveillance than a casino?&nbsp; In our opinion this is like taking =
candy from a baby.&nbsp; An absolute natural.&nbsp;<BR>

for the Secret Service. The Secret Service was able to monitor the =
President from remote locations during the opening and closing =
ceremonies of 2002 Winter Olympic games held in Salt Lake City, =
Utah.<BR>
After viewing the company's video online we found out that The Peace =
Corps, the U.S. Secret Service, Exxon Gas Stations, Chevron Gas =
Stations, Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants are all customers of =
Synergetic Technologies Inc. and now added to this prestigious list is =
E-Bay.<BR>
