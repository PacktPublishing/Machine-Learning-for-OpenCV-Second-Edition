<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>FROM THE DESK OF:<BR>
MRS JULLIET ABRAMS<BR>
AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK<BR>
HEADQUARTERS<BR>
COTONOU<BR>
REPUBLIC OF BENIN.<BR>
<BR>
I am MRS JULLIET ABRAMS, credit officer of African<BR>
Development Bank. I have an urgent and very<BR>
confidential business proposition for you.<BR>
<BR>
In June, 1998, a British Oil consultant/contractor<BR>
with the West African's oil and Solid Minerals<BR>
Corporation, Mr. David Van Buskirk made a numbered<BR>
time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar<BR>
months, valued at US$35,000,000.00(Thirty five Million United States =
Dollars only) in my branch. Upon maturity,I sent a routine =
notification<BR>
to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a<BR>
month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered<BR>
from his contract employers, the West African oil and<BR>
Solid Minerals Corporation that Mr.David Van Buskirk<BR>
died in an air crash along with his wife on the 31st<BR>
October, 1999 in an Egyptian airline 990 with other<BR>
passengers on board.<BR>
<BR>
On further investigation,I found out that he died<BR>
without making a WILL, and hitherto, all attempts to<BR>
trace his next of kin was fruitless. Mr.David Van<BR>
Buskirk was residing at No 1 Rue de Avenida, G.R.A.<BR>
Cotonou, Benin Republic.<BR>
<BR>
I therefore made further investigation and discovered<BR>
that Mr.David Van Buskirk did not declare any kin or<BR>
relations in all his official documents, including his<BR>
Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of<BR>
US$35,000,000.00 is still sitting in my<BR>
Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the<BR>
principal sum at the end of each year. No one will<BR>
ever come forward to claim it. According to Laws of<BR>
Benin, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money<BR>
will be declared frozen and forfeited to the&nbsp;<BR>
Benin Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.<BR>
<BR>
Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a<BR>
foreigner to stand in as the next of kin or business<BR>
partner to Mr.David Van Buskirk so that<BR>
the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into<BR>
the hands of some corrupt government officials. This<BR>
is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your<BR>
full names and address,phone and fax numbers so that<BR>
the attorney will prepare the necessary<BR>
documents and affidavits that will put you in place as<BR>
the next of kin or business partner. We shall employ<BR>
the services of an attorney for drafting<BR>
and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the<BR>
necessary documents and letter of<BR>
probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.<BR>
<BR>
A bank account in any part of the world that you will<BR>
provide will then facilitate the transfer of this<BR>
money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin.<BR>
<BR>
The money will be paid into your account for us to<BR>
share in the ratio of 65% for me, 30% for you and 5%<BR>
for expenses incurred in the course of the<BR>
transaction.<BR>
<BR>
We could also use an ASSET MANAGEMENT COMPANY in<BR>
Europe to secure this funds and transfer to your<BR>
account in your country.<BR>
<BR>
There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this<BR>
transaction will be done legitimately and with my<BR>
position as the credit officer guarantees the<BR>
successful execution of this transaction. If you are<BR>
interested, please reply immediately to<BR>
my email box.<BR>
<BR>
Please send me your confidential telephone and fax<BR>
numbers for easy communication.<BR>
<BR>
You should observe utmost confidentiality cum secrecy,<BR>
and rest assured that this transaction would be most<BR>
profitable for both of us because<BR>
I will require your assistance to invest my share in<BR>
your country.<BR>
<BR>
Awaiting your urgent reply.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks and regards.<BR>
<BR>
