transaction.</DIV>
<DIV>For the purpose of introduction,I am Dr Yakubu Lawal,&nbsp; =
<BR>Head,Operations Manager, International Trust Bank Plc,<BR>in charge =
of&nbsp; personal and corporate accounts<BR>above US$5,000,000.00(five =
million US Dollars only). I<BR>came to know of you in my private search =
for a<BR>reliable and reputable person to handle a very<BR>confidential =
transaction which involves the transfer<BR>of a huge sum of money to a =
foreign account requiring <BR>maximum =
confidence.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=

sp;&nbsp; THE PROPOSITION:<BR>A foreigner, late Mr Grahams Peterson, an =
Oil<BR>Merchant/Contractor with the Federal Govenment of<BR>Nigeria, =
until his death three years ago in a ghastly<BR>auto crash, banked with =
us here at International Trust<BR>Bank PLC., Lagos, and had a =
closing<BR>balance of USD$21.5M (Twenty-One Million, Five =
Hundred<BR>Thousand United States Dollars only) which the bank<BR>now =
unquestionably expects to be claimed by any of his<BR>available foreign =
next of kin or alternatively be<BR>donated to a discredited trust fund =
for arms and<BR>ammunition at a military war college here in =
Nigeria.<BR>Fervent valuable efforts are being made by the Bank =
to<BR>get in touch with any of the Peterson family or<BR>relatives but =
all have proved to no avail. It is<BR>because of the perceived =
possibility of not going to<BR>be able to locate any of late Mr Grahams =
Peterson's<BR>next of kin (he had no&nbsp; wife and children) that =
the<BR>management under the influence of our Chairman, Board<BR>of =
Directors, Retired Major General Kalu Uke Kalu,<BR>that an arrangement =
for the fund to be declared <BR>"UNCLAIMABLE" and then be subsequently =
donated to the<BR>Trust Fund for Arms and Ammunition which will =
further<BR>enhance the course of war in Africa and the world =
in<BR>general.<BR>In order to avert this negative development, =
myself<BR>and some of my trusted colleagues in the bank now seek<BR>for =
your permission to have you stand as late Mr<BR>Grahams Peterson's next =
of kin so that the fund,<BR>USD$21.5M would be subsequently transferred =
and paid<BR>into your bank account as the beneficiary next of =
kin.<BR>All documents and proves to enable you get this fund<BR>have =
been carefully worked out and we are assuring you<BR>a 100% risk free =
involvement. Your share would be 30%<BR>of the total amount,5% has been =
set aside for expenses<BR>while the rest would be for myself and my =
colleagues<BR>for investment purposes in your company or any =
country<BR>of your choice where the returns on investment will =
be<BR>optimal.<BR>If this proposal is acceptable to you and you do =
not<BR>wish to take advantage of the trust we hope to bestow<BR>on you =
and your company, then kindly get to me<BR>immediately via my e-mail =
furnishing me with:<BR>1.The Names you want to use for this =
