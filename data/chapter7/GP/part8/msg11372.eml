OTC Pink Sheets:&nbsp; TIRR&nbsp; today&nbsp; announced&nbsp; the&nbsp; =
acquisition of a 100%<BR>
working interest in a 4 well oil field in Karnes County, Texas.&nbsp; =
The<BR>
South&nbsp; Texas&nbsp; field, which has been shut in since the mid =
1990s when<BR>
the price&nbsp; of&nbsp; oil&nbsp; declined&nbsp; to&nbsp; less&nbsp; =
than&nbsp; $10.00&nbsp; per barrel, is<BR>
situated on 260 acres. Tradestar will initially focus its efforts in<BR>
the Nobson&nbsp; Field,&nbsp; which&nbsp; has&nbsp; reserves&nbsp; =
of&nbsp; approximately&nbsp; 100,000<BR>
barrels.&nbsp; The&nbsp; company&nbsp; also&nbsp; has&nbsp; options on =
adjoining acreage with<BR>
additional prospects. The&nbsp; recompletion&nbsp; project,&nbsp; =
anticipated to be<BR>
completed and online by mid- November, is expected&nbsp; to&nbsp; =
yield&nbsp; 25-30<BR>
barrels of oil per day.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Oct&nbsp; 6,&nbsp; 2004&nbsp; Tradestar&nbsp; Corporation&nbsp; (OTC =
Pink Sheets: TIRR) today<BR>
announced the acquisition of a&nbsp; producing gas well and disposal =
well<BR>
in Erath&nbsp; County,&nbsp; Texas.&nbsp; The&nbsp; single&nbsp; =
well&nbsp; package&nbsp; is&nbsp; currently<BR>
producing&nbsp; 50 thousand cubic feet of natural gas per day and has =
one<BR>
offset drill location&nbsp; that&nbsp; could&nbsp; push&nbsp; daily =
production to better<BR>
than 200 thousand cubic&nbsp; feet&nbsp; per&nbsp; day.&nbsp; An&nbsp; =
additional&nbsp; 300&nbsp; acres<BR>
surrounding the wells are under option as well. The acquisition also<BR>
offers&nbsp; Barnett&nbsp; Shale&nbsp; potential,&nbsp; which Tradestar =
CEO Tom Feimster<BR>
called &quot;strategic&quot; in light&nbsp; of&nbsp; the company's =
current joint venture<BR>
with United Production and Exploration.<BR>
<BR>
With oil and natural gas prices sitting near&nbsp; 10-year&nbsp; =
highs,&nbsp; North<BR>
American&nbsp; oil&nbsp; &amp;&nbsp; gas&nbsp; companies are generating =
exceptionally strong<BR>
financial&nbsp; results.&nbsp;&nbsp; With&nbsp; increased&nbsp; =
consumption&nbsp; and&nbsp; reliance on<BR>
foreign imports driving the price of crude to nearly $50 per barrel,<BR>
the resulting US energy situation is the most serous domestic energy<BR>
crisis since the Arab oil embargo of the 1970&#146;s.&nbsp; With more =
than 57%<BR>
of US oil coming from foreign&nbsp; imports,&nbsp; US&nbsp; crude&nbsp; =
inventories&nbsp; are<BR>
likely&nbsp; to&nbsp; remain&nbsp; at&nbsp; low&nbsp; levels&nbsp; =
given&nbsp; anemic&nbsp; production&nbsp; from<BR>
Venezuela&nbsp; and Nigeria, continuing uncertainty over Iraqi wells, =
and<BR>
production&nbsp; caps&nbsp; from&nbsp; OPEC.&nbsp;&nbsp; On&nbsp; =
the&nbsp; natural&nbsp; gas&nbsp; front, supply<BR>
continues to remain&nbsp; tight&nbsp; to&nbsp; increasing&nbsp; =
demand,&nbsp; with&nbsp; shrinking<BR>
relative&nbsp; US&nbsp; production.&nbsp;&nbsp; These&nbsp; =
international&nbsp; supply&nbsp; issues are<BR>
increasingly driving a&nbsp; renewed&nbsp; trend&nbsp; towards domestic =
exploration<BR>
and&nbsp; production&nbsp; operations,&nbsp; New&nbsp; =
developments&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; petroleum<BR>
industry&nbsp; are&nbsp; beginning&nbsp; to&nbsp; play&nbsp; out in =
terms of discovery of new<BR>
reserves and more&nbsp; efficient&nbsp; production&nbsp; of existing =
reserves, with<BR>
the increased use of technologies such as&nbsp; 3-D&nbsp; seismic&nbsp; =
making&nbsp; new<BR>
exploration more affordable and effective, and with use of secondary<BR>
and&nbsp; tertiary recovery processes to recover the more than 60% of =
oil<BR>
left in-ground with primary production techniques.<BR>
<BR>
Tradestar Corporation is a rapidly&nbsp; emerging independent oil and =
gas<BR>
company, engaged in the exploration, development,&nbsp; and&nbsp; =
exploitation<BR>
of&nbsp; on-shore&nbsp; oil&nbsp; and natural gas opportunities in =
proven producing<BR>
areas&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; United&nbsp;&nbsp; States,&nbsp;&nbsp; =
including&nbsp; Oklahoma,&nbsp; Texas,&nbsp; and<BR>
Louisiana.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; Company&nbsp; intends&nbsp; to&nbsp; =
utilize&nbsp; advanced&nbsp;&nbsp; oilfield<BR>
surveying&nbsp; and extraction technologies, such as 3-D seismic, =
lateral<BR>
drilling, and&nbsp; enhanced&nbsp; oil&nbsp; recovery,&nbsp; to&nbsp; =
identify,&nbsp; acquire, and<BR>
exploit bypassed&nbsp; and&nbsp; overlooked&nbsp; reserves&nbsp; =
which&nbsp; can&nbsp; be&nbsp; rapidly<BR>
exploited&nbsp; without&nbsp; significant&nbsp; risk&nbsp; and capital =
expenditure.&nbsp; The<BR>
Company is capitalizing on both of&nbsp; the major trends in domestic =
oil<BR>
and gas E&amp;P operations, carefully screening and selecting =
properties<BR>
for&nbsp; maximum&nbsp; potential&nbsp; of&nbsp; overlooked&nbsp; =
and&nbsp;&nbsp; bypassed&nbsp;&nbsp; production<BR>
opportunities,&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; using&nbsp; advanced&nbsp; =
production&nbsp; technologies&nbsp; to<BR>
minimize risks.&nbsp; Under the guidance of a management team =
experienced<BR>
in oil and gas&nbsp; exploration&nbsp; and production, Tradestar has =
developed<BR>
critical strategic relationships with oil industry partners&nbsp; =
and&nbsp; is<BR>
beginning&nbsp; an aggressive acquisition strategy, targeting a number =
of<BR>
highly promising opportunities throughout the United States.&nbsp; With =
a<BR>
number of major&nbsp; projects&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; acquisition =
pipeline, we believe<BR>
that TIRR presents a unique chance&nbsp; to&nbsp; invest&nbsp;&nbsp; =
in&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; domestic<BR>
oil&nbsp; &amp;&nbsp; gas&nbsp; boom.&nbsp; Aggressive&nbsp; =
investors&nbsp; looking for above-average<BR>
return potential on&nbsp; a&nbsp; portion&nbsp; of&nbsp; their =
investment capital should<BR>
give TIRR serious consideration.&nbsp; Management of the Company,&nbsp; =
headed<BR>
by&nbsp; CEO Tom Feimster, are highly talented and experienced in the =
oil<BR>
&amp; gas industry,&nbsp; and&nbsp; posses&nbsp; a&nbsp; wealth&nbsp; =
of&nbsp; technical expertise and<BR>
knowledge.&nbsp; We believe that TIRR has developed a viable&nbsp; =
and&nbsp; highly<BR>
promising&nbsp; acquisition strategy, backed by its commitment to the =
use<BR>
of&nbsp; new&nbsp; oilfield&nbsp; technologies&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp; =
focus&nbsp; on&nbsp; exploiting&nbsp; proven<BR>
producing properties, which should enable&nbsp; the&nbsp; Company&nbsp; =
to&nbsp; rapidly<BR>
develop&nbsp; significant&nbsp; revenue streams.&nbsp; Investors at =
current trading<BR>
levels may be rewarded&nbsp; over&nbsp; the&nbsp; short&nbsp; term&nbsp; =
and beyond as TIRR&#146;s<BR>
business plan is executed.&nbsp; TIRR is one of the&nbsp; =
market&#146;s&nbsp; best&nbsp; kept<BR>
secrets,&nbsp; and&nbsp; we&nbsp; expect&nbsp; investors&nbsp; to&nbsp; =
give this issue increasing<BR>
attention over the coming months.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A&nbsp; Few Reasons to Consider Adding TIRR to Your Investment =
Portfolio.<BR>
<BR>
The&nbsp; outlook&nbsp; for oil &amp; gas stocks is extremely positive =
with prices<BR>
at&nbsp; historic&nbsp; levels&nbsp; and&nbsp; continued&nbsp; =
demand&nbsp; stimulating additional<BR>
exploration and production efforts among domestic producers.&nbsp;&nbsp; =
While<BR>
it&nbsp; seems&nbsp; unlikely that prices will remain at their current =
levels,<BR>
the&nbsp; long&nbsp; term&nbsp; outlook&nbsp; for&nbsp; both&nbsp; =
demand&nbsp; and&nbsp; higher&nbsp; prices&nbsp; is<BR>
unparalleled in&nbsp; recent&nbsp; history.&nbsp;&nbsp; With&nbsp; =
current market conditions,<BR>
domestic E&amp;P companies are experiencing a huge run-up in&nbsp; =
prices&nbsp; as<BR>
they seek to exploit North America&#146;s significant oil and natural =
gas<BR>
resource&nbsp;&nbsp; base&nbsp;&nbsp; with&nbsp;&nbsp; new&nbsp; =
exploration&nbsp; techniques&nbsp; and&nbsp; drilling<BR>
technologies.&nbsp; Through its dual&nbsp; positioning&nbsp; in =
high-growth oil and<BR>
natural gas markets, we believe&nbsp; that&nbsp; TIRR&nbsp; is&nbsp; =
exceptionally&nbsp; well<BR>
situated&nbsp; to&nbsp; benefit&nbsp; from&nbsp; these&nbsp; =
favorable&nbsp; market conditions and<BR>
stands to see significant appreciation&nbsp; of&nbsp; its share price =
over the<BR>
near term period.<BR>
<BR>
With its operations in the exploration&nbsp; and&nbsp; production&nbsp; =
of&nbsp; natural<BR>
gas&nbsp; properties, TIRR is ideally positioned at the forefront of a =
US<BR>
natural&nbsp;&nbsp; gas&nbsp;&nbsp; boom.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =
As&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; US&nbsp;&nbsp; demand&nbsp;&nbsp; for&nbsp;&nbsp; =
natural&nbsp; gas&nbsp; is<BR>
increasing, domestic&nbsp; production&nbsp; is&nbsp; becoming&nbsp; =
strained&nbsp; with&nbsp; many<BR>
long-term prime producing areas reaching the point of depletion.&nbsp; =
By<BR>
2020,&nbsp; US&nbsp; consumption&nbsp; of&nbsp; natural&nbsp; gas, =
driven by the expansion of<BR>
gas-fired electric generation&nbsp; facilities,&nbsp; is&nbsp; expected =
to reach 37<BR>
trillion cubic feet from approximately 23&nbsp; Tcf&nbsp; =
currently.&nbsp;&nbsp; Natural<BR>
gas&nbsp; prices&nbsp; on the spot market have nearly doubled from less =
than 2<BR>
years ago, and&nbsp; are&nbsp; currently&nbsp; testing&nbsp; the&nbsp; =
$6 per million British<BR>
thermal units (Btu) price threshold, with increases to&nbsp; $8-9&nbsp; =
levels<BR>
likely&nbsp; over the winter months.&nbsp; With US demand exceeding =
production<BR>
of roughly 18-19 Tcf per&nbsp; year,&nbsp; approximately 14% of US =
natural gas<BR>
needs are already being imported&nbsp; from&nbsp; Canada.&nbsp;&nbsp; =
With&nbsp; natural&nbsp; gas<BR>
impossible&nbsp; to&nbsp; transport&nbsp; across oceans (with the =
exception of LNG,<BR>
which&nbsp; represents&nbsp; a&nbsp;&nbsp; small&nbsp;&nbsp; =
fraction&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; overall&nbsp; natural&nbsp; gas<BR>
consumption), this&nbsp; has&nbsp; created&nbsp; a&nbsp; =
tremendous&nbsp; future for domestic<BR>
E&amp;P firms, including TIRR.<BR>
<BR>
Tradestar is in the process of acquiring&nbsp; a&nbsp; balanced&nbsp; =
portfolio&nbsp; of<BR>
producing&nbsp; oil&nbsp; &amp;&nbsp; gas&nbsp; properties&nbsp; =
onshore&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; Gulf coast and<BR>
Oklahoma, which will significantly&nbsp; improve its asset base, =
revenue,<BR>
and earnings outlook over the near term period.&nbsp;&nbsp; TIRR&nbsp; =
has&nbsp; entered<BR>
into&nbsp; a&nbsp; letter&nbsp; of&nbsp; intent to acquire two =
properties in the heavily<BR>
producing Arkoma Basin region of&nbsp; Oklahoma, one of the most =
prolific<BR>
natural gas producing areas in North America with estimated reserves<BR>
of 30 Tcf.&nbsp; The Company has&nbsp; also&nbsp; proposed&nbsp; a&nbsp; =
JV&nbsp; project&nbsp; in&nbsp; the<BR>
dynamic Barnett Shale natural gas play in Central Texas, the largest<BR>
producing gas field in Texas with estimated reserves of more than 10<BR>
Tcf.&nbsp;&nbsp; TIRR&nbsp; has additionally acquired a 260 acre =
property in Karnes<BR>
County,&nbsp; Texas&nbsp; a&nbsp; mature&nbsp; producing&nbsp; =
area&nbsp; which&nbsp; can&nbsp; provide&nbsp; new<BR>
opportunities&nbsp; due&nbsp; to&nbsp; improvements&nbsp;&nbsp; in&nbsp; =
drilling&nbsp; technology&nbsp; and<BR>
production&nbsp; techniques.&nbsp;&nbsp; With&nbsp; these&nbsp; =
properties,&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; additional<BR>
planned&nbsp; acquisitions&nbsp; in&nbsp; the onshore Gulf Coast region, =
we believe<BR>
that Tradestar is admirably positioned as a Strong junior oil =
&amp;&nbsp; gas<BR>
investment.<BR>
<BR>
TIRR has developed an innovative business model centered on&nbsp; =
pursuit<BR>
of&nbsp; a&nbsp; balanced&nbsp; development and exploration strategy and =
portfolio,<BR>
and the use of&nbsp; advanced&nbsp; oilfield survey and recovery =
technologies,<BR>
which will significantly&nbsp; improve&nbsp; production&nbsp; =
efforts&nbsp; at&nbsp; acquired<BR>
properties.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tradestar&nbsp; seeks&nbsp; to&nbsp; =
acquire&nbsp; bypassed and overlooked<BR>
reserves in proven producing areas, and to develop working interests<BR>
in undercapitalized and&nbsp; under-producing&nbsp; projects.&nbsp; TIRR =
intends to<BR>
capitalize&nbsp; and&nbsp; maximize&nbsp; on&nbsp;&nbsp; =
already&nbsp;&nbsp; developed&nbsp;&nbsp; drilling&nbsp;&nbsp; and<BR>
exploration&nbsp; projects&nbsp; with&nbsp; lower cost initiatives that =
have a high<BR>
degree of success including&nbsp; infield&nbsp; drilling (drilling of =
multiple<BR>
wells&nbsp; onto&nbsp; an&nbsp; existing&nbsp; leasehold),&nbsp; =
development&nbsp; of&nbsp; behind-pipe<BR>
reserves (development of shallower &#147;pay&#148;&nbsp; zones&nbsp; =
above&nbsp; the&nbsp; deepest<BR>
productive&nbsp; zone&nbsp; on&nbsp; established wells), secondary and =
EOR recovery<BR>
techniques,&nbsp; lateral&nbsp; drilling,&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; =
the&nbsp; use&nbsp; of&nbsp; other&nbsp; advanced<BR>
completion and production techniques.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tradestar&nbsp; =
also&nbsp; intends&nbsp; to<BR>
aggressively&nbsp;&nbsp; pursue&nbsp; acquisition&nbsp; =
opportunities&nbsp; for&nbsp; higher-risk,<BR>
higher reward E&amp;P&nbsp; prospects,&nbsp; utilizing&nbsp; =
advanced&nbsp; data analysis to<BR>
reprocess older 2-D seismic data with 3-D&nbsp; seismic&nbsp; and&nbsp; =
correlating<BR>
this&nbsp; seismic,&nbsp; gravity, geochemical and geologic data with =
existing<BR>
well&nbsp; logs&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp; significantly&nbsp;&nbsp; =
mitigate&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; expense&nbsp; and&nbsp; risk<BR>
traditionally associated with new E&amp;P projects.<BR>
