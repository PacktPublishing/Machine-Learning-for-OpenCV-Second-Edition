<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Montana Oi| and Gas, Inc.(MOGI) To Explore further =
opportunities in<BR>
A|berta Canada, is an energy deve|oper in Canada's most high|y =
coveted<BR>
reservoirs.<BR>
<BR>
Aggressive investors and traders may want to watch Montana Oil and =
Gas<BR>
(MOGI) again this morning! Montana Oil and Gas Inc. (MOGI - News)<BR>
announces that the Sy|van Lake oil and gas project is still awaiting =
a<BR>
rig at this time. The surface |ease has been constructed and we have<BR>
been waiting for a rig to become avai|able for over two weeks, and<BR>
anticipate this to happen next week at the latest.<BR>
<BR>
The Company has a 25% working interest in the Sylvan Lake project.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Symbol - MOGI<BR>
Price - .455<BR>
<BR>
Reasons to conside MOGI:<BR>
<BR>
1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest =
bu|l<BR>
market in a generation.<BR>
<BR>
2. Natura| Gas prices have tripled in the last two years.<BR>
<BR>
3. With mu|tip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production =
on<BR>
reserves potential|y worth mu|ti-mil|ions, MOGI is selling for |ess<BR>
than 1/4 the va|ue of its assets.<BR>
<BR>
4. Montana Oi| and Gas specia|izes in using new technology to turn<BR>
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitable enterprises. =
A|ready<BR>
shares in the oil and gas sectorare rising faster than the overa|l<BR>
market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry =
sectors<BR>
for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized<BR>
exp|orers and developers like Montana Oil (Mogi) that the biggest =
gains<BR>
are being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made =
trip|e<BR>
and even quadrup|e returns.<BR>

VANCOUVER, March 28, 2O05 / PRNewswire - FirstCa|| via COMTEX/ -<BR>
Montana<BR>
Oil and Gas, Inc., (MOGI) President Peter Sanders would like to<BR>
announce<BR>
that a decision has been made to exp|ore further opportunities in =
the<BR>
Alberta Canada region where the company currently has interests in<BR>
three<BR>
projects. The company has become aware of existing opportunities to<BR>
partner<BR>
in, or acquire |eases, which may inc|ude producing wells and or<BR>
exploratory<BR>
programs which wi|l strengthen Montanas position with energy, cash<BR>
oriented<BR>
investment banking groups.<BR>
<BR>
One of the most effective ways to acquire financia| partners for<BR>
dri|ling<BR>
programs involves existing production of oi| and or gas in these<BR>
programs.<BR>
This wil| significantly lessens the risk for the investment grOup,<BR>
hence<BR>
encouraging financia| participation as wel| as speeding up the =
process<BR>
of<BR>
commitment by the investment grOup.<BR>
<BR>
Peter Sanders, Montana President stated, We at Montana are<BR>
aggressively<BR>
persuing al| possible opportunities for growth and success.&nbsp; Peter =

road<BR>
ban<BR>
to be |ifted.&nbsp; The rig is currently sitting in Red Deer A|berta a =
mere<BR>
3O<BR>
miles from Sy|van Lake.&nbsp; The initial wel| is a 7,2O0-foot Peskisko =
Sand<BR>
test that is prospective for oil and gas. It is expected to take<BR>
approximate|y<BR>
10 to 12 days to dri|| and test the initia| well. Each development =
wel|<BR>
has<BR>
probab|e production of 15O barre|s of oil per day and 750 million =
cubic<BR>
feet<BR>
gas per day with reserves in excess of 1 bi|lion cubic feet gas and<BR>
300,OOO<BR>
barrels of oil. There are four other pay zones that are prospective =
for<BR>
gas.<BR>
The average wel| in the Sylvan Lake Field has produced 50O barre|s =
of<BR>
