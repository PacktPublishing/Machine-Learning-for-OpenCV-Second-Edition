An artist asked the gallery owner if there had been any interest in =
his<BR>
paintings on display at that time.&nbsp; &quot;I have good news and bad =
news,&quot; the<BR>
owner replied.&nbsp; &quot;The good news is that a gentleman enquired =
about your work<BR>
and wondered if it would appreciate in value after your death. When I =
told<BR>
him it would, he bought all 15 of your paintings.&quot;&quot;That's =
wonderful,&quot; the<BR>
artist exclaimed. &quot;What's the bad news?&quot;&quot;He was your =
doctor.&quot;<BR>
My mother and I were standing at he check-out in the supermarket as =
the<BR>
cashier scanned the things we bought. When the price of a bottle of =
orange<BR>
juice was scanned as $4,, my mother said &quot;It's only $3.95.&quot;The =
cashier<BR>
stopped wheat she was doing and disappeared down one of the aisles to =
check<BR>
the price. she soon returned and said that the price was $3.95. When =
she<BR>
handed my mother the change, a five cent coin rolled onto the floor. =
Much to<BR>
my amusement, as the cashier bent over to search for it, my mother said =
&quot;Oh,<BR>
don't bother, it's only five cents.&quot;<BR>
