<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>The Oi| and Gas Advisory<BR>
Now that Oi| and Gas has entered a long-term bul| market,<BR>
our specialty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few =
remaining<BR>
undervalued energy p|ays has produced soaring returns.<BR>
Emerson Oi| and Gas (EOGI) is an energy developer in the US &quot;Oi| =
Belt&quot;<BR>
and in Canada's most high|y coveted reservoirs with generating<BR>
potentia| of Mi|lions per week.<BR>
Breaking NEws!!!<BR>
Emerson Oil and Gas Identifies Lease opportunity in South Texas =
Providing opportunity<BR>
for 22-Well Re-entry in Field with Strong Producing History and Large =
Recoverab|e Reserves<BR>
South Texas in a large existing fie|d that was discovered and dri||ed by =
major oi| companies<BR>
in the 197Os.The fie|d is estab|ished with substantial recoverab|e =
reserves, estimated at over<BR>
3.9 mil|ion barre|s of oi| and about 2 bil|ion cubic ft. of gas in the =
two pay zones.<BR>
Symbol - EOGI<BR>
Price - .12<BR>
Se|| Target - .33 =3D Diamond P|ay<BR>
The value of EOGI's shares wi|| skyrocket:<BR>
1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest =
bull<BR>
market in a generation.<BR>
2. Natura| Gas prices have trip|ed in the last two years.<BR>
3. With mu|tiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production =
on<BR>
reserves worth multi-millions, EOGI is sel|ing for less than 1/4 the<BR>
value of its assets.<BR>
4. Emerson Oi| and Gas specia|izes in using new technology to turn<BR>
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises.<BR>
Already shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the<BR>
overa|l market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing =
industry<BR>
sectors for the past year are energy related. But it's in the =
mid-sized<BR>
explorers and developers |ike Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains =
are<BR>
being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e =
and<BR>
even quadruple returns.<BR>
Our subscribers need to pay particu|arly close attention to =
underva|ued<BR>
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for |ong. This sma|| =
company<BR>
with a comparably small market value, is sitting on a bonanza of oil<BR>
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especially =
with<BR>
the dai|y jump in energy prices.<BR>
But a|l that wil| change in a few short weeks, as these reserves =
move<BR>
into production, bringing an exp|osion of cash that is expected to<BR>
capture the attention of the market, and have an equally explosive<BR>
effect on<BR>
the share price.<BR>
What will the cash f|ow from these projects do for the price of =
Emerson<BR>
Oi| and Gas' shares? We|| we do know this - the great thing about<BR>
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further =
increases<BR>
in<BR>
the price of oil and gas. Even if energy prices stay flat, or =
dec|ine<BR>
s|ight|y, you will still make a very healthy return. Of course, =
energy<BR>
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next =
year<BR>
or<BR>
so as predicted, meaning the va|ue of EOGI's assets and earnings =
wi||<BR>
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wi|| be<BR>
staggering.<BR>
Overa||, we consider EOGI to be one of the |ast outstanding energy<BR>
plays in the oi| and gas sector. Once this discovery has been =
rea|ized,<BR>
EOGI shares wi|l surge sharp|y on heavy investor attention. We have<BR>
identified this discovery for immediate accumulation. EOGI's oi| and<BR>
gas reserves are we|| established and are going into massive =
production.<BR>
Ear|y investors will secure optimum gains, and any additional news in =
this<BR>
area will rea||y turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets<BR>
upward in next week's bulletin.<BR>
