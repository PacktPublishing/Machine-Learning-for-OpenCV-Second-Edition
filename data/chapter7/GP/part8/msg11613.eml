estimates and projections at the time the statements are made that =
involve a number of risks and uncertainties which could cause actual =
results or events to differ materially from those presently anticipated. =

and directors to pay expenses,a nominal cash position,and no revenue in =
its most recent quarter. It is not currently an operating company. The =
company is going to need financing. If that financing does not occur, =
the company may not be able to continue as a going concern in which case =
you could lose your entire investment. Other risks and uncertainties =
include, but are not limited to, the ability of the Company to complete =
the planned bridge financing, market conditions, the general acceptance =
of the Company's products and technologies, competitive factors, timing, =
and other risks associated with their business. The publisher of this =
