<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Dear sir/madam.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;As you read this,I don't want you to feel sorry for<BR>
me,because,I believe everyone will die someday.<BR>
<BR>
My name is Cletus Guase , a merchant in Cote<BR>
D'Ivoire.I have been diagnosed with Esophageal Cancer<BR>
which was discovered very late,due to my laxity in<BR>
caring for my health. It has defiled all forms of<BR>
medicine, and right now I have only about a few months<BR>
to live, according to medical experts.<BR>
<BR>
I have not particularly lived my life so well, as<BR>
never&nbsp; really cared for anyone not even myself but my<BR>
business.Though I am very rich, I was never generous,<BR>
I was always hostile to people and only focused on my<BR>
business as that was the only thing i cared for.But<BR>
now I regret all these as I now know that there is<BR>
more to life than just wanting to have or make all the<BR>
money in the world.<BR>
<BR>
I believe when gives me a second chance to come to<BR>
this world I would live my life in a different way<BR>
from how I have lived it. Now that God has called me,<BR>
I have willed and given most of my properties and<BR>
assets to my immediate and extended family members and<BR>
as well as a few close friends.<BR>
<BR>
I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul and<BR>
so,I&nbsp; have decided to give arms to charity<BR>
organizations and give succour and comfort to the less<BR>
priviledged in our societies, as I want this to be one<BR>
of the last good deeds I will do on earth. So far, I<BR>
have dedicated the money to some charity organizations<BR>
in the Cote D'Ivoire, Algeria and Malaysia.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;Now that my health has deteriorated so badly I cannot<BR>
do this my self anymore.I once asked members of my<BR>
family to close one of my accounts and distribute the<BR>
money which I have there to charity organization and<BR>
to the less priviledged in Bulgaria and,they refused<BR>
and kept the money to themselves.<BR>
&nbsp;Hence,I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not<BR>
to satisfied with what I have left for them.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;The last of my money which no one knows of is the<BR>
huge cash deposit of Three million dollars that I have<BR>
with a security Company in Accra Ghana for safe<BR>
keeping. I will want you to help me collect this<BR>
deposit and disburse it to some charity organizations<BR>
and to the less priviledged.<BR>
<BR>
What do you do with my donation?COI recycle them if<BR>
you can.With this fund,you can buy enough<BR>
clothing,you'll be providing all new clothes, food,<BR>
fresh water, health care, and educational assistance<BR>
to children on a long-term ongoing care.<BR>
<BR>
Please send me a mail to indicate if you will assist<BR>
me in this disbursement.I have set aside 10% for you<BR>
for your time.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks in Anticipation.<BR>
<BR>
Cletus Guase.<BR>
