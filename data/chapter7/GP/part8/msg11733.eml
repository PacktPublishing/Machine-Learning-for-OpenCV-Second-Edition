<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>FROM THE DESK OF DR .COMBLATO AHMED<BR>
BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER<BR>
AFRICAN DEVLOPMENT BANK (A.D.B)<BR>
OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA FASO.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Dear Friend ,<BR>
<BR>
I am the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance =
department<BR>
of AFRICAN DEVLOPMENT BANK (A.D.B)&nbsp; I am writing to seek your =
intrest over<BR>
a transaction. In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of =
$35.5M<BR>
&nbsp; US DOLLARS,&nbsp; . In an account that belongs to one of our =
foreign customer<BR>
who died along with his entire family in November 2000 in a plane =
crash.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his =
next<BR>
of kin to come over and claim his money because my bank cannot release =
it<BR>
unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the =
deceased<BR>
as indicated in our banking guidelines. but I&nbsp; learnt that all his =
supposed<BR>
next of kin&nbsp;&nbsp; or relation died alongside with him at the plane =
crash leaving<BR>
nobody behind for the claim.although my bank is still waiting for the =
next<BR>
of kin to come long for claims. It is therefore upon this discovery =
that<BR>
I and my office colleague in my department now decided to make this =
business<BR>
proposal to you so that the bank will release the money to you as the =
next<BR>
of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent =
disbursement<BR>
since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to be =
confiscated<BR>
and moved into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.<BR>
<BR>
The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if any customer's =
account<BR>
remains unserviceable,and unclaimed after five years, the money will =
be<BR>
transferred into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund.<BR>
<BR>
The request of&nbsp; foreigner as next of kin in this business is =
occasioned<BR>
by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkina citizen =
cannot<BR>
stand as next of kin to a foreigner.<BR>
<BR>
We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, =
in<BR>
<BR>
respect to the provision of a foreign account,and your imense =
contribution<BR>
in championing the success of this deal.&nbsp; when this fund is =
released into<BR>
your account,10 % will be set aside for expenses incurred by both =
parties<BR>
during the business and will be reimbursed accordingly,then 60 % would =
be<BR>
for me and my colleague. There after I and my colleague will visit =
your<BR>
country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. =
Therefore<BR>
to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged, you =
must<BR>
apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased =
indicating<BR>
your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and =
fax<BR>
number for easy and effective communication and location where in the =
money<BR>
will be remitted .<BR>
<BR>
Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the =
text<BR>
of the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that =
this<BR>
transaction&nbsp; is riskfree and that you should not entertain any atom =
of fear<BR>
as we have perfected the riskfree of this business .<BR>
<BR>
You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this =
proposal.<BR>
<BR>
Trusting to hearing from you immediately.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Yours faithfully,<BR>
<BR>
DR. COMBLATO AHMED.<BR>
