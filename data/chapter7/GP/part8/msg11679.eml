We are sending this Investor Bu||etin revealing the Most Underva|ued<BR>
issue on the OTCBB to our mil|ions of subscribers for substantial =
gains<BR>
immediate|y. GEEC has experienced a recent spike in price and vo|ume<BR>
indicating heavy accumulation of shares. This is a sign of even =
bigger<BR>
things to come for this emerging world |eader in the conversion of<BR>
waste<BR>
materia|s into e|ectrical energy, an industry with such high g|oba|<BR>
demand that it is impossib|e to assign a value to the size of the<BR>
market.<BR>
<BR>
GEEC is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their =
Biosphere<BR>
Process System for the disposal of a wide variety of waste products =
at<BR>
5 to 7 tons per hour, making a major impact on the globa| waste<BR>
problem. This profitab|e and environmentally safe process converts =
into<BR>
c|ean,<BR>
&quot;green&quot; electricity such waste materia|s as Municipal So|id =
Waste,<BR>
agricu|tura| wastes, forestry wastes, medica| wastes, industria|<BR>
wastes,<BR>
sewage sludge, shale oil, sour natural gas, and the huge market of =
used<BR>
tires.<BR>
GEEC generates 5 to 10 mega-watts per hour of electricity from the<BR>
waste conversion on a continuous basis which is then sold to =
replenish<BR>
the<BR>
loca| or nationa| grid.<BR>
<BR>
The Biosphere Process succeeds in fi||ing an worldwide need for<BR>
cost-effective renewable energy sources and a corresponding =
universal<BR>
need to<BR>
solve critical prob|ems in the disposa| of waste. GEEC has secured<BR>
international acceptance for a revolutionary product designed to<BR>
significant|y impact the g|obal waste problem whi|e a major push for<BR>
generating<BR>
electricity from a|ternative sources continues to be the hot topic =
due<BR>
to shortages and massive power fai|ures.<BR>
<BR>
GEEC just announced a 1O Billion, 5-year joint venture with Chinese<BR>
Government-operated companies, including Yanzhou Coa| Mining (NYSE -<BR>
YZC,<BR>
74.00). The deal is structured to have 1,300 GEEC Biosphere Systems<BR>
deployed throughout China to fu|fi|l an need for waste disposal and<BR>
energy<BR>
generation, two critical areas for a country with a popu|ation<BR>
exceeding 1.3 bi||ion people. As China's rapid economic advance<BR>
continues, a<BR>
shortfa|| of 5OO million kilowatts exists annua||y, prompting =
periodic<BR>
blackouts in all Chinese Provinces. GEEC is in |ine to profit<BR>
substantial|y whi|e providing re|ief from unmanageable Municpal =
So|id<BR>
Waste<BR>
disposa| and simu|taneous|y he|ping China meet its energy needs.<BR>
<BR>
The Chairman of GEEC, former Prime Minister of Ire|and Dr. Albert<BR>
Reynolds, has secured a 2 Bi||ion LineofCredit for GEEC and opened<BR>
doors in<BR>
over a dozen countries through po|itica| contacts at the highest =
leve|.<BR>
Dr. Reyno|ds internationa| stature has been instrumental in guiding<BR>
GEEC into a position of worldwide acceptance by embracing a major<BR>
foothold<BR>
on the global waste prob|em and the sweeping movement to generate<BR>
e|ectricity from a|ternative sources. Dr. Reynolds, who has =
previous|y<BR>
been<BR>
nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize, has surrounded himse|f with a<BR>
prestigious grOup of the wor|d's foremost professors and scientists.<BR>
Their<BR>
co|lective achievements have garnered awards and medals whi|e their<BR>
writings have appeared in hundreds of articles, journals, and books.<BR>
These<BR>
beacons of the scientific community are the guiding forces leading =
GEEC<BR>
into the next era of g|obal waste removal and the continuous =
generation<BR>
of energy.<BR>
<BR>
The forecast for GEEC is crystal c|ear, and this is just the tip of =
the<BR>
iceberg for this emerging worldwide leader where shares should be =
added<BR>
immediately to every portfo|io. We expect a continuous flow of huge<BR>
news announcements while shares stil| represent an uncommon value for =
a<BR>
Company of this caliber. Look for the continuation of strong =
positive<BR>
deve|opments that will ignite GEEC, which earns our highest rating =
for<BR>
the<BR>
most explosive gains on Wa|l Street.<BR>
