Dear Sir/Madam,<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; SUBJECT: CAYSOFT EMAIL SWEEPSTAKES AWARD.<BR>
<BR>
This is to officially provide you with the result of our Caysoft =
Sweepstake<BR>
Intl Program, which was conducted on the 27th day of April 2005. This =
email<BR>
address attached to Serial no: 31105 have consequently won you our =
lottery<BR>
program in the general prize category. You have now been approved to =
collect<BR>
a total payment sum of USD$970,000.00 (NINE HUNDRED AND SEVEN THOUSAND =
US<BR>
DOLLARS ONLY) attaches to file REF NO: CSI/8813/6329-05. We know it =
will<BR>
be of a surprise to have received such a notification message due to =
the<BR>
fact that you did not purchase any lottery ticket from us and the high =
rate<BR>
of internet scam, but be informed here that this is a free =
promotional/test<BR>
program from us as a way of introducing our software services and also =
in<BR>
promoting the benefit of the Internet usage.<BR>
<BR>
These funds can be claim by contacting our approved payment finance =
house.<BR>
Due to the fact that this program was done base on computer =
programming,<BR>
we ask that you keep a low profile until your claim has been processed =
and<BR>
your winning entitlement remitted to you the beneficiary; as this is =
part<BR>
of our own new security measures. You can begin your claim now by =
contacting<BR>
our Payment center on email address: hockinsfinance@katamail.com with =
your<BR>
Full names, Postal Address, Telephone/Fax numbers, reference/serial =
numbers<BR>
and the amount won for the remittance of your winning entitlement. Be =
informed<BR>
also that all funds not claimed or applied for after the 11th day of =
May<BR>
2005 will be return back to us.<BR>
<BR>
Congratulations as we expect you to make good use of these funds.<BR>
<BR>
Sincerely,<BR>
Paul B. Danny.<BR>
