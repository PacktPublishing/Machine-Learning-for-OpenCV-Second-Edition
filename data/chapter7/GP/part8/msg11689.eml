LONDON -- (AP WorldStream via COMTEX) -- The U.S. dollar has fallen to =
an all-time low against the Euro.&nbsp; The euro hit a new high of US =
$1.3646, exceeding the record US $1.3643 set in European trading.&nbsp; =
Brokers say there is nothing to tempt investors to buy the dollar, which =
has suffered in recent weeks over fears about the size of the U.S. =
fiscal and budget deficits.&nbsp; Now is the time for you to take =
advantage of the opportunities the Euro has to offer.&nbsp; From the =
Desk of Estelle Rivas.<BR>
