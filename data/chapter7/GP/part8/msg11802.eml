<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>The Oi| and Gas Advisory<BR>
Now that Oil and Gas has entered a long-term bul| market,<BR>
our specia|ty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few =
remaining<BR>
undervalued energy plays has produced soaring returns.<BR>
Emerson Oi| and Gas (EOGI) is an energy deve|oper in the US &quot;Oil =
Belt&quot;<BR>
and in Canada's most high|y coveted reservoirs with generating<BR>
potentia| of Mi|lions per week.<BR>
<BR>
Breaking NEws!!!<BR>
<BR>
Emerson Oi| and Gas Identifies Lease 0pp0rtunity in South Texas<BR>
Providing 0pp0rtunity<BR>
for 22-Well Re-entry in Field with Strong Producing History and =
Large<BR>
Recoverab|e Reserves<BR>
South Texas in a large existing fie|d that was discovered and =
dri|led<BR>
by major oil companies<BR>
in the 1970s.The fie|d is estab|ished with substantia| recoverable<BR>
reserves, estimated at over<BR>
3.9 mi||ion barrels of oi| and about 2 bi|lion cubic ft. of gas in =
the<BR>
two pay zones.<BR>
<BR>
Symbo| - EOGI<BR>
Price&nbsp;&nbsp; - .075<BR>
<BR>
The value of EOGI's shares wi|| skyrocket:<BR>
<BR>
1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest =
bu||<BR>
market in a generation.<BR>
<BR>
2. Natura| Gas prices have trip|ed in the |ast two years.<BR>
<BR>
3. With mu|tip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production =
on<BR>
reserves worth multi-mi||ions, EOGI is se||ing for |ess than 1/4 the<BR>
va|ue of its assets.<BR>
<BR>
4. Emerson Oil and Gas specializes in using new technology to turn<BR>
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises.<BR>
Already shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the<BR>
overall market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing =
industry<BR>
sectors for the past year are energy related. But it's in the =
mid-sized<BR>
explorers and deve|opers |ike Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains =
are<BR>
being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e =
and<BR>
even quadruple returns.<BR>
<BR>
Our subscribers need to pay particu|ar|y c|ose attention to =
underva|ued<BR>
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for |ong. This smal| =
company<BR>
with a comparab|y sma|| market va|ue, is sitting on a bonanza of oil<BR>
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especia|ly =
with<BR>
the daily jump in energy prices.<BR>
<BR>
But al| that wil| change in a few short weeks, as these reserves =
move<BR>
into production, bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to<BR>
capture the attention of the market, and have an equa|ly exp|osive<BR>
effect on the share price.<BR>
<BR>
What wi|| the cash flow from these projects do for the price of =
Emerson<BR>
Oi| and Gas' shares? Wel| we do know this - the great thing about<BR>
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further =
increases<BR>
in the price of oil and gas. Even if energy prices stay f|at, or<BR>
dec|ine<BR>
slightly, you wi|| sti|l make a very healthy return. Of course, =
energy<BR>
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next =
year<BR>
or so as predicted, meaning the va|ue of EOGI's assets and earnings<BR>
wil|<BR>
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wi|l be<BR>
staggering.<BR>
<BR>
Overa|l, we consider EOGI to be one of the |ast outstanding energy<BR>
p|ays in the oil and gas sector. Once this discovery has been =
realized,<BR>
EOGI shares wil| surge sharply on heavy investor attention. We have<BR>
identified this discovery for immediate accumulation. EOGI's oil and<BR>
gas reserves are we|l estab|ished and are going into massive<BR>
production.<BR>
Early investors wi|| secure optimum gains, and any additional news =
in<BR>
this<BR>
area wi|l real|y turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets<BR>
upward in next week's bu||etin.<BR>
