<P>FROM: Desire Guei </P>

<P>Our present situation have made us to send you this mail which I am =
sure will come to you as a surprise. Please we mean you no harm only we =
are in a desperate situation and need urgent help. After going through =
this email it will be your decision, whether to help this bereaved =
family or to leave us to our faith, but whatever you decide,please bear =
in mind that we are in need of your help.PLEASE MAIL ME ON MY PRIVATE =
BOX AS STATED BELOW. </P>
<P>My name is Desire Guei,20years,the Son of the late military ruler of =
Ivory-Coast (Retired Brigadier General Robert Guei) who was assasinated =
in a political crisis which led to war in my country(Ivory-Coast) on =
19th september,2002. My father,mother and two junior brothers were =
killed by some soldiers believed to be loyal to the government because =
of my father's objection to some certain policies of the present =
government. I was lucky to have escaped with my younger sister that =
night because we were visiting a family friend in another city far away =
from our home.</P>
<P>I have to go into hiding with my sister for some days before =
arrangements were made for us to leave Ivory-Coast for the Republic of =
Togo on the invitation of President Eyadema of Togo who granted us =
political assylum.</P>
<P>Before we left for Togo,I visited our home where my mother and my two =
junior ones were killed in our village and during the search for some =
documents in my father's room came accross some vital documents and the =
keys to a secret vault in the house.I took the keys and went down to =
where the vault is and there I discovered a metal box which was =
carefully hidden. With the aide of the documents I was able to open the =
box only to find out that the box was full of money in hundred dollar =
bills. I could not count the money because I was very shocked to see it =
because it was too much for me to count but the documents that I =
discovered in his room which led me to the box put the money at =
$10,000,000(Ten million USD). </P>
<P>I locked it back carefully and arranged for the box to be moved with =
me through the help of a family friend to Abidjan the capital city where =
I deposited it with a security company for safe-keeping.I did not =
declare the content of box to the security company,I only declare it as =
family valuables. </P>
<P>When the African leaders came to Ivory-Coast and President Eyadema =
invited us to go to the Republic of Togo where I now live with my junior =
one. I cannot touch the money and even afraid to tell it to our family =
friends who have been coming to visit us in Togo. I decided that it will =
be better to move the money abroad where I can put to safe and have it =
invested.This has been my reason for contacting you.</P>
<P>I would have given you my telephone number so that you can call me in =
order to discuss the issue better but I'm afraid to do so because we =
have too many people around us who I would not want to know of the =
money.It will be better for me to communicate through Internet until we =
can make proper and solid arrangements about how to move the money.</P>
<P>I wish to meet with you if you can make a trip to The Republic of =
Togo or Ivory-Coast,then we can meet secretly before we go ahead for the =
transaction.I am ready to offer 20% of the money to you for this =
assistance.It is not that I am paying you but for your assistance which =
I shall really appreciate. </P>
<P>Please I wish that this assistance be treated highly =
confidential.</P>
<P>Waiting to read your response about the proposal soonext.</P>
