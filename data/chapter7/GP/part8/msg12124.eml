Approx. Float : 9 million<BR>
30 Day Target : 6.25<BR>

<BR>
Recent News and Major Share-Price Driving Milestones:<BR>
<BR>
GEEC just announced a 10 Billion, 5-year joint venture with several<BR>
companies operated by the Chinese Government.<BR>
<BR>
GEEC uses their Biosphere Process System to convert various types of<BR>
waste into clean, &quot;green&quot; electricity at 5 to 10 mega-watts =
per hour.<BR>
<BR>
GEEC Chairman, former Prime Minister of Ireland Dr. Albert Reynolds,<BR>
has secured a 2 Billion LineOfCredit for GEEC and opened doors in =
over<BR>
a<BR>
dozen countries through political contacts at the highest level.<BR>
<BR>
GEEC is CBS Marketwatch.com's #1 Best Performer in the DJ =
Diversified<BR>
Industrials Index in the last 3 months. This Dow Jones Index also<BR>
contains 3M, GE, and Honeywell.<BR>
<BR>
Conservative estimates value the company at One Billion.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Solving a Dual Crisis - Waste and Energy<BR>
<BR>
GEEC is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their =
Biosphere<BR>
Process System for the disposal of a wide variety of waste products =
at<BR>
5 to 7 tons per hour, making a major impact on the global waste<BR>
problem. This profitable and environmentally safe process converts =
into<BR>
clean,<BR>
&quot;green&quot; electricity such waste materials as Municipal Solid =
Waste,<BR>
agricultural wastes, forestry wastes, medical wastes, industrial<BR>
wastes,<BR>
sewage sludge, shale oil, sour natural gas, and the huge market of =
used<BR>
tires.<BR>
GEEC generates 5 to 10 mega-watts per hour of electricity from the<BR>
waste conversion on a continuous basis which is then sold to =
replenish<BR>
the<BR>
local or national grid.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
China's Aggressive Pursuit of GEEC makes 2005 a &quot;Blue-Chip&quot; =
Year<BR>
<BR>
GEEC just announced a 10 Billion, 5-year joint venture with Chinese<BR>
Government-operated companies, including Yanzhou Coal Mining (NYSE -<BR>
YZC,<BR>
74.00). The deal is structured to have 1,300 GEEC Biosphere Systems<BR>
deployed throughout China to fulfill a need for waste disposal and<BR>
energy<BR>
generation, two critical areas for a country with a population<BR>
exceeding 1.3 billion people. As China's rapid economic advance<BR>
continues, a<BR>
shortfall of 500 million kilowatts exists annually, prompting =
periodic<BR>
blackouts in all Chinese Provinces. GEEC is in line to gain<BR>
substantially<BR>
while providing relief from unmanageable Municpal Solid Waste =
disposal<BR>
and simultaneously helping China meet its energy needs.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Future Milestones:<BR>
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GEEC had a 100 Million backlog of sales =
orders for the Biosphere<BR>
before the China joint-venture with 26 completed Biospheres in<BR>
operation.<BR>
The backlog is now into the Billions with complete financing to be<BR>
provided by China and 1,300 Biospheres to be deployed throughout the<BR>
country.<BR>
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GEEC's present assets of 35 Million =
will conservatively jump into<BR>
the 300 Million range, a 10-times increasee.<BR>
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GEEC is in advanced stages of agreement =
on at least 6 major<BR>
international projects which could add 50 Million to the bottom-line =
or<BR>
1.42<BR>
per share.<BR>
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P/E on average for this Industry Gr0up =
is 20 to 1 putting GEEC above<BR>
the 13.00 range without any future business expansion.<BR>
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GEEC is expected to file for a higher =
exchange listing and continue<BR>
to pay common stock and spin-off stock dividends.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Worldwide Market Potential 15 to 25 Billion over next 5 years with =
no<BR>
other known company that can match their technology, leadership, or<BR>
explosive sales growth.<BR>
<BR>
Up until now GEEC has been one of Wall Street's best kept secrets, =
yet<BR>
now it seems the cat is coming out of the bag and the release of =
this<BR>
new Investor Awareness Campaign should be excellent timing in =
regards<BR>
to<BR>
some new PR's forthcoming which will Rocket GEEC. This power-play =
has<BR>
nowhere to go but up, according to most insiders, and there's still =
a<BR>
bit of time to get in before the boom. Increased investor awareness =
and<BR>
the anticipated release of huge news announcements will add to the<BR>
buying frenzy from investors loading up before GEEC goes through the<BR>
roof.<BR>
