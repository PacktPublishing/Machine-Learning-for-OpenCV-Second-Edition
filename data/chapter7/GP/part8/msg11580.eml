***ABOUT THE COMPANY***<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Advanced Powerline Technologies is engaged in the broadband over =
powerline<BR>
industry.&nbsp; Their business is based on the idea of using existing =
power<BR>
lines, both in the home and outside, to transmit information.&nbsp; =
This<BR>
information includes broadband internet and the development of &quot;the =
21st<BR>
century home&quot; concept in which home appliances and computers are =
networked.&nbsp;<BR>
APWL and others in the industry have exciting plans to turn =
pre-existing<BR>
electrical infrastructure into big business.&nbsp; APWL has been engaged =
in the<BR>
industry for many years and have been awarded numerous applicable =
patents.<BR>
<BR>
Read on to find more information as to why APWL is our HOT PICK of =
the<BR>
month!<BR>

<BR>
***NEWS FROM THE INDUSTRY***<BR>
<BR>
New Millennium Research Council (NMRC) has recently released a report =
in<BR>
which they say:<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Many industry watchers and representatives now believe BPL =
(broadband over<BR>
power lines) can dramatically change the landscape of the broadband =
market,<BR>
offering new forms of competition and delivering high-quality service =
to<BR>
remote<BR>
areas.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Is 2005 the year of BPL? There are a number of signs that suggest =
this<BR>
could be the time the<BR>
technology begins its emergence as a viable competitor in the =
broadband<BR>
market.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;During the past two years, the commercial and media perspectives =
on BPL in<BR>
the United States have<BR>
evolved from categorizing the technology as &quot;almost ready&quot; to =
&quot;really here.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Current research into the BPL industry indicates a belief among =
some<BR>
experts that the industry may<BR>
be primed for real growth in 2005 and beyond.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
(CNET NEWS)-February 24, 2004- Earlier this month, the Federal<BR>
Communications Commission proposed rules for utility companies that seek =
to<BR>
offer Internet access through their electricity grids. The FCC hopes =
its<BR>
rules for broadband over power line (BPL) will help jump-start the use =
of<BR>
the grid network to deliver high-speed Net access to U.S. =
households,<BR>
especially in hard-to-reach rural areas.<BR>
<BR>
(IDG News Service)-April 10, 2005- The European Union's =
communications<BR>
regulator, the European Commission, launched an initiative on Friday =
to<BR>
boost the growth of broadband Internet access over power transmission =
lines.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The news on this sector is everywhere.&nbsp; 2005 is the year for =
Advanced<BR>
Powerline Technologies.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
***TOP REASONS TO CONSIDER APWL***<BR>
<BR>
* Advanced Powerline Technologies is poised at the pinnacle of the =
most<BR>
modern technology since the development of cable fiber optics.<BR>
<BR>
* Advanced Powerline Technologies has fathered a quantum leap forward =
in<BR>
advanced cable free high-resolution video.<BR>
<BR>
* APT's Technology significantly reduces many of the expensive cable<BR>
placements now necessary to bring audio/video and high speed internet to =
the<BR>
end user.<BR>
<BR>
* APT is engaged in acquiring contracts to provide their technology =
to<BR>
countries and regions where power lines are the norm but in which =
internet<BR>
over telephone lines has not, or can not reach the market.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The time to act is now.&nbsp; News is out for APWL.&nbsp; The sector is =
ready to<BR>
explode onto the scene.&nbsp; The road is paved for Big Returns on =
investment.<BR>

As with many micro-cap stocks, today's company has additional risk<BR>
factors worth noting. Those factors include: a limited operating =
history,<BR>
the company advancing cash to related parties and a shareholder on =
an<BR>
unsecured basis: one vendor, a related party through a majority<BR>
stockholder, supplies ninety-seven percent of the company's raw =
materials:<BR>
reliance on two customers for over fifty percent of their business =
and<BR>
numerous related party transactions and the need to raise capital. =
These<BR>
factors and others are more fully spelled out in the company's SEC<BR>
filings. We urge you to read the filings before you invest.&nbsp; The =
