Vinoble, Inc. - An Emerging Security Conglomerate Continues to Make =
Landmark=20
Acquisitions in Rapidly Growing 100+ Billion Homeland Security Sector! =
Vinoble=20
is poised to become a Comprehensive Provider of End-to-End Security =
Solutions=20
for Corporate Clients<br>
<br>
<br>
>From the investor's point of view:<br>
<br>
Over the last several years, one of the most dynamic and rapidly growing =

segments of the US economy has been the security industry, which is =
increasingly=20
incorporating innovative new technologies to combat the growing threat =
of=20
terrorism. In the wake of September 11, the US government and private =
industry=20
have invested billions to ensure the safety of citizens, private =
industry, and=20
infrastructure. This burgeoning homeland security industry has undergone =

exponential growth as a result, with industry revenues expected to top =
170=20
billion in 2006, from approximately 100 billion in 2003, according to =
market=20
research firm Homeland Security Research Corporation. With extensive =
federal=20
government spending on homeland security, a continued and significant =
terrorist=20
threat, increased legislative mandates requiring increased protection, =
and=20
enhanced awareness of security risks to private commerce, we believe =
that=20
investment in homeland security companies presents one of the most =
attractive=20
opportunities on the Street.<br>
<br>
With dramatic increases in security spending from government and the =
private=20
sector, the investment community has been quick to recognize the huge =
investment=20
potential that security stocks promise. Simply put small investments now =
in=20
emerging security companies can make you solid gains over the long term! =
We are=20
already beginning to see the impact of this huge industry. While the =
security=20
systems and services industry as a whole has seen an average price =
appreciation=20
of over 18% over the past year, innovative companies in homeland =
security such=20
as GIIS, CMMD, UGHO, and NSSC have posted average gains of over 85% in =
that same=20
period!!! With this in mind, we would like to introduce you to one of =
the most=20
promising and rapidly growing new players in Homeland Security, Vinoble, =
Inc.<br>
<br>
<br>
Company Summary:<br>
<br>
Security provider, with a comprehensive offering of security systems,=20
consulting, and products targeting the corporate market. Central to the=20
Company's business is the identification and acquisition of synergistic =
business=20
opportunities in homeland security, information security, and other =
related=20
services, to rapidly improve top and bottom line growth and enhance =
shareholder=20
value. To facilitate this strategy, the Company has entered into a =
financing=20
partnership with GarcyCo Capital Corp., which will assist in finding,=20
structuring, and financing new acquisitions. Vinoble has recently signed =
binding=20
memorandum for the acquisition of two target companies which will =
provide=20
comprehensive security services, MSI and Secure Enterprise Solutions =
(SES).<br>
<br>
MSI is a New York-based provider of physical security services with over =
29=20
years of experience. MSI provides a range of service to protect clients' =

physical infrastructure, property, and personnel, and has a number of =
high=20
profile corporate clients including the Estee Lauder Companies. MSI is=20
profitable and has historical revenues in the 1.1 million range, with =
total=20
revenues of 2.4 million conservatively expected for 2005.<br>
<br>
SES is an established information security and IT consulting firm which =
provides=20
a full range of information security services ranging from IT-security=20
assessments and penetration testing to policy development and secure=20
architecture design. As part of its compliance programs, SES utilizes =
its proven=20
information security lifecycle methodology to provide professional =
security=20
consulting services aimed at helping its clients comply with =
HealthInsurance=20
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Sarbanes-Oxley and other =
legislative=20
enactments. SES sells its products and services through a channels =
program and a=20
direct sales effort. SES' largest channel partner is Verizon, with =
smaller=20
channel partners including Sobel, The Steel Foundation, Baker Street =
Associates,=20
and Vytek. We expect SES to generate revenues in excess of 1 million for =
2005.<br>
<br>
An integral component of Vinoble's acquisition strategy is the use of=20
cross-selling its product offerings to generate additional top-line =
growth and=20
facilitate economies of scale. The Company is further pursuing a number =
of=20
additional acquisitions which will significantly broaden its suite of =
security=20
products and services. With an experienced management team, a stable =
revenue and=20
customer base, and its acquisition strategy in a rapidly expanding but =
heavily=20
fragmented security industry, we believe that Vinoble is well positioned =
to=20
become a major player in a Homeland Security market expected to reach =
170=20
billion by 2006.<br>
<br>
<br>
Management team:<br>
<br>
Vinoble, Inc. boasts an impressive senior management team with extensive =

experience in the security and information technology industries, who =
have=20
developed important relationships within the industry and with the =
investment=20
community which will prove invaluable in rolling out the Company's =
acquisition=20
strategy. Key members of the Company's management team include:<br>
<br>
Joseph Lively, CEO- a business executive and attorney, brings over 16 =
years=20

problems.=20
Prior to private practice, Mr. Lively was president and COO of Alcohol =
Sensors=20

the=20
company as it was emerging from bankruptcy protection. Mr. Lively =
managed all=20
operational aspects of the business including sales and marketing, =
product=20

his career=20

computer crime investigation and computer forensics.<br>
<br>
Gus Cecchini, Director of Counter-Terrorism &amp; Risk Assesment =
Division- is a=20
twenty year veteran of the New York City Police Department, and has =
spent the=20
last three years in the Department's Counter Terrorism Unit, working to =
develop=20
preventative measures in the wake of September 11. He was given =
substantial=20
training on counter terrorism measures from the Federal Bureau of =
Investigation=20
(FBI) and the United States Military. In addition, he has completed =
coursework=20
in federal law enforcement risk assessment and security; studies in =
chemical and=20
biological agents at the Department of Justice; and coursework in risk=20
assessment and method of instruction at the FBI Academy. His =
responsibilities at=20
the Company will include overall management of the company's Counter =
Terrorism &amp;=20
Risk Assessment Division, as well as the coordination and implementation =
of=20
educational seminars in counter terrorism training, risk assessment and=20
executive protection.<br>
<br>
<br>
A few reasons to consider VNBL:<br>
<br>
1. In the wake of September 11, and an increased attention to protection =
from=20
terrorism and criminal attacks, the Homeland Security industry has =
entered a=20
period of exponential growth. The Homeland Security market is expected =
to grow=20
from approximately 100 billion in 2003 to more than 170 billion by =
2006!! In=20
July 2002, the Office of Homeland Security released a listing of =
strategic=20
priorities including the prevention of terrorist attacks in the US, a =
reduction=20
of America's vulnerability to terrorism, and to minimize the damage and =
recover=20
from attacks that do occur. These priorities extend far beyond =
traditional=20
conceptions of government sponsored security, and initiatives in =
corporate=20
security and information security are now an integral component. With =
its broad=20
offering of physical security services and information security, Vinoble =
is=20
ideally positioned to benefit from this boom in Homeland Security =
spending.<br>
<br>
2. Vinoble has developed a broad service and product suite and is poised =
to=20
provide comprehensive end-to-end security solutions for its clients. =
Vinoble is=20
undertaking a dramatic and aggressive expansion and acquisition strategy =
which=20
will enable it to rapidly grow its business and emerge as a =
comprehensive=20
provider of integrated security services and products. Vinoble intends =
to=20
capitalize on the dramatic growth in the security market by delivering=20
professional services, security products, security training, and managed =

security services. In pursuit of this objective, Vinoble has assembled a =
highly=20
qualified team of security professionals offering a full range of =
security=20
services. Through Vinoble's consulting services and integrated delivery=20
solutions, Vinoble will help organizations protect key assets including =
persons,=20
property, information, brand, and reputation.<br>
<br>
3. Vinoble has undertaken a key strategic relationship with GarcyCo =
Capital=20
Corp. to assist and finance the Company's acquisition strategy. This=20
relationship has already resulted in the acquisition of MSI and SES, and =
the=20
Company is currently considering a number of additional target =
candidates over=20
the near-term period, which will assist it in developing a comprehensive =

security offering and rapidly growing revenues over the near-term.<br>
<br>
4. VNBL boasts an impressive and highly experienced senior management =
team, with=20
CEO Joseph Lively overseeing an extensive acquisition program, and =
bringing over=20
16 years of experience as a senior executive and attorney in addition to =
an=20
early career spent as an NYPD Officer. Thomas Welch VP of Operations and =
COO has=20
spent more than 22 years in the information systems and security =
industry, and=20
recently appointed director of the Company's Counter-Terrorism and Risk=20
Assessment division, Gus Cecchini is a 20 year veteran of the NYPD and=20
counter-terrorism expert.<br>
<br>
5. The Homeland Security market is highly fragmented, creating =
tremendous=20
opportunities for acquisitions. According to the Hallcrest Report, there =
are=20
more than 30,000 security companies worldwide, and an increasing demand =
for=20
integrated security solutions and comprehensive offerings has spurred a =
wave of=20
acquisitions within the industry. Some recent and notable acquisitions =
include=20
Marsh &amp; McLennan's 1.9 billion acquisition of Kroll, GE's purchase =
of InVision=20
Technologies for 900 million, FLIR Systems purchase of Indigo Systems =
for 190=20
million, and Armor Holdings purchase of Simula for 110.5 million.<br>
<br>
6. VNBL has developed a solid and recurring revenue stream from its =
first two=20
acquisitions. Based only on conservative revenue projections for its =
first two=20
acquisitions, MSI and SES, we expect VNBL to see revenues of =
approximately 3.5=20
million for FY 2005, or approximately 0.20 per share. Homeland Security =
stocks=20
trade at an average price to sales ratio of approximately 3x. Were we to =
apply=20
this metric to VNBL's conservative projections, we could therefore =
arrive at a=20
relative valuation of about 0.60 per share. We believe that the impact =
of=20
acquisitions currently in discussion could easily boost VNBL's revenues =
to the=20
10 million range for 2005. At this range, Vinoble stock could have a =
relative=20
valuation of 1.75 per share, representing the significant upside =
potential that=20
this Company provides to early investors.<br>
