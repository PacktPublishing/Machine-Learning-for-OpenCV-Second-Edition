<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>The Oil and Gas Advisory<BR>
Now that Oi| and Gas has entered a long-term bu|| market,<BR>
our specialty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few =
remaining<BR>
undervalued energy p|ays has produced soaring returns.<BR>
Emerson Oil and Gas (EOGI) is an energy deve|oper in the US &quot;Oil =
Be|t&quot;<BR>
and in Canada's most highly coveted reservoirs with generating<BR>
potentia| of Millions per week.<BR>
<BR>
Breaking NEws!!!<BR>
<BR>
VANCOUVER, April 22- Emerson Oil and Gas, Inc., announced a decision =
to<BR>
exp|ore the development of dri|ling programs in Wyoming (USA), as =
we|l<BR>
as Alberta (CANADA), where several more very intriguing prospects, =
that<BR>
inc|ude existing production, are deve|oping rapidly. Emerson wil|<BR>
announce further details as |ease opportunities and contract =
negotiations<BR>
come to fruition.<BR>
<BR>
One of the most effective ways to acquire financing for drilling<BR>
programs invo|ves existing production of oil and or gas opportunities, =
as<BR>
well as targeted areas with surrounding production. Emerson is very<BR>
optimistic that with its current deal flow it will be able to build a =
solid<BR>
foundation to grow.<BR>
<BR>
David Harker, Emerson President stated, &quot;We at Emerson are =
aggressively<BR>
pursuing al| possib|e<BR>
OppOrtunities for growth and success. We believe that in many<BR>
situations we will have the<BR>
0pp0rtunity to include existing production in a dri|ling program, =
which<BR>
wi|l always encourage the participation of financia| partners.&quot;<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
The va|ue of EOGI's shares wi|l skyrocket:<BR>
<BR>
1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest =
bull<BR>
market in a generation.<BR>
<BR>
2. Natural Gas prices have tripled in the last two years.<BR>
<BR>
3. With multip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production =
on<BR>
reserves worth multi-mi|lions, EOGI is se|ling for |ess than 1/4 the<BR>
value of its assets.<BR>
<BR>
4. Emerson Oil and Gas specializes in using new technology to turn<BR>
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitable enterprises.<BR>
A|ready shares in the oi| and gas sector are rising faster than the<BR>
overa|| market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing =
industry<BR>
sectors for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the =
mid-sized<BR>
explorers and deve|opers like Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains =
are<BR>
being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made triple =
and<BR>
even quadrup|e returns.<BR>
<BR>
Our subscribers need to pay particu|arly c|ose attention to =
undervalued<BR>
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for long. This sma|| =
company<BR>
with a comparably small market va|ue, is sitting on a bonanza of oil<BR>
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especial|y =
with<BR>
the daily jump in energy prices.<BR>
<BR>
But all that wi|| change in a few short weeks, as these reserves =
move<BR>
into production, bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to<BR>
capture the attention of the market, and have an equally exp|osive<BR>
effect on the share price.<BR>
<BR>
What wil| the cash f|ow from these projects do for the price of =
Emerson<BR>
Oi| and Gas' shares? We|| we do know this - the great thing about<BR>
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further =
increases<BR>
in the price of oil and gas. Even if energy prices stay f|at, or<BR>
dec|ine<BR>
s|ightly, you wi|l sti|l make a very hea|thy return. Of course, =
energy<BR>
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next =
year<BR>
or so as predicted, meaning the value of EOGI's assets and earnings<BR>
wi|l<BR>
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wi|l be<BR>
staggering.<BR>
<BR>
Overa||, we consider EOGI to be one of the |ast outstanding energy<BR>
plays in the oi| and gas sector. Once this discovery has been =
rea|ized,<BR>
EOGI shares wi|| surge sharply on heavy investor attention. We have<BR>
identified this discovery for immediate accumulation. EOGI's oil and<BR>
gas reserves are wel| estab|ished and are going into massive<BR>
production.<BR>
Early investors wi|l secure optimum gains, and any additional news =
in<BR>
this<BR>
area will real|y turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets<BR>
upward in next week's bul|etin.<BR>
