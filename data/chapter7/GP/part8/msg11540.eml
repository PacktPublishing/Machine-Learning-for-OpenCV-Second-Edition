REPLY TO: udoh2004@latinmail.com<BR>
<BR>
AN IMMEDIATE RESPONSE IS HIGHLY APPRECIATED<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;This is to seek your co-operation as my foreign partner<BR>
and your assistance to enable me own a property and<BR>
invest in the stable economy of your country. Accept<BR>
my apologies if this mail does not suit your personal<BR>
or business ethics.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;My name is Mr. Donald Udoh. I am making this venture<BR>
proposal to you in strict confidence. The money we<BR>
want to invest was acquired from an over invoiced<BR>
contract proceed. This is in my capacity as the<BR>
chairperson of the senate financial committee<BR>
on foreign contracts verification and payments<BR>
(Member, Contract Review Panel (CRP). Our good<BR>
fortune is that we are privy to such classified<BR>
information.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;The amount in question is $28,200,000.00 Million US<BR>
Dollars. As a senior civil servant in the Nigerian<BR>
Government, our country's prudential policy prohibits<BR>
me from operating a foreign account. If you would like<BR>
to assist me as a partner, please kindly indicate your<BR>
interest after which we shall both discuss on the<BR>
modalities.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;All other information to facilitate the remittance of<BR>
the funds will be revealed to you in due course. For<BR>
your assistance, you shall receive 25% of the funds to<BR>
be transferred and 5% will be set aside for all<BR>
expenses incurred by both parties.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;I would appreciate if this proposal is kept<BR>
confidential because of what I have explained above.<BR>
Note that you can reach me urgently on my e-mail,or<BR>
in my&nbsp; (American internet fax number 1 775-514-1606,<BR>
which I believe is more secured).<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;Please do indicate your direct telephone and fax<BR>
number when replying to this business proposal. I will<BR>
be calling you when necessary. In the meantime, I will<BR>
appreciate if you can contact me through my alternative<BR>
email udoh2004@latinmail.com<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;A swift acknowledgement on the receipt of this mail<BR>
will be appreciated.<BR>
<BR>
Best regards,<BR>
Mr. Donald Udoh<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
