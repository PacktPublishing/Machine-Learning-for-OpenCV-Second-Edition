Dear Sir,<BR>
It is my pleasure to write this letter to you. First, I must ask your =
utmost confidentiality in this transaction by virtue of it being utterly =
confidential. I am Mr. Robert Kokoh, a member of the Ghana Export =
Promotion Council (GEPC).<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;I am currently in Europe on a one year traning course. I was also =
with the government delegation to your country during a bilateral trade =
conference.<BR>
<BR>
I have decided to seek your assistance and co-operation in the execution =
of a business transaction described here under for the benefit of all =
parties and hope that you keep it confidential because of the nature of =
the Transaction.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;We basically seek your assistance to front in the transfer of =
US$30,500,000.00 (Thirty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States =
Dollars Only).<BR>
<BR>
Source: I was working as a Director of Project Implementation within the =
Ministry of Energy and Mineral resources and with co-operation of three =
other top officials, we have in our possession an overdue payment in US =
funds.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;The said funds represents certain percentage of the contract value =
executed on behalf of my Ministry by a foreign contracting firm, which =
we the officials over-invoiced by a total amount of<BR>
US$30,500,000.00 (Thirty Million Five Hundred Thousand United States =
Dollars).<BR>
<BR>
Though the actual contract cost has been paid to the original =
contractor, leaving the excess balance unclaimed.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;But by virtue of us being civil servants we cannot acquire this =
fund in our names, Therefore I was delegated as a matter of trust by my =
colleagues to look for an overseas partner into whose account we would =
transfer the funds hence we are writing you this letter.<BR>
<BR>
Our government is determined to pay foreign contractors all debts owned =
so as to maintain continued good relations with both the foreign =
governments and non government financial agencies. We have decided to =
include our bills for approval with the co-operation of some officials =
at the Department of Finance and the Central Bank of Ghana (CBG).<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;We hereby seek your assistance to act as the beneficiary of the =
unclaimed funds since we are not allowed to operate a foreign account. =
You will provide us with a good front and partnership to process the =
remittance of the money to you as a form of contract payment.<BR>
<BR>
This process will be an internal arrangement with the departments =
concerned and we will handle this here, your duty is to act as the =
contractor and have the contract sum paid to you.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;I have the authority of my partners to invite you into this matter =
and with your acceptance<BR>
of our invitation, your share as compensation will be 20%, and 70% will =
be for us and 10% will be for the settlement of taxation and other =
miscellaneous expenses incurred.<BR>
<BR>
The business itself is 100% safe, fail proof and risk-free, provided you =
treat it with utmost confidentiality and you follow our instructions =
carefully and religiously.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;Your area of business specialization does not matter as it cannot =
hinder the successful execution of this transaction. I hope I can put my =
confidence in you in this matter.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;Please contact me by return email to indicate your willingness and =
capability to assist us.<BR>
Thank you for your anticipated co-operation and I await the receipt of =
our message to enable me bring you into the complete picture of the =
transaction.<BR>
<BR>
Yours faithfully,<BR>
Mr James Kofi.&nbsp; </FONT>
