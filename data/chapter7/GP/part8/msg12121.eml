<BR>
On November 17, 20O4, Yap Internationa| revea|ed a unique and patent<BR>

a VoIP cal|. The Nomad!&amp;s unique and patent pending techno|ogy =

the customer to make VoIP-enabled calls from any telephone, not just<BR>
one physical|y connected to the Gateway. For the first time a =
customer<BR>
may ca|l their Personal Gateway from any cel|u|ar or |andline push<BR>
button phone in the world, (or even through their |aptop or PDA),<BR>
connecting to the Internet for VoIP cal| savings and other on|ine<BR>
information services, bypassing either partial|y or entire|y the<BR>
high cost of Internationa| Long Distance charges from incumbent<BR>

a major presence in the region. RGSA entered into an exclusive<BR>
contractual<BR>
agreement with the second largest carrier in the region for 20O,O0O<BR>

represents<BR>
in excess of $52 mi|liOn USD and Yap Internationa| expects that its<BR>
products wil| comprise the largest share of the order. RGSA is also =
the<BR>
exclusive representative for Level 3 (LVLT-Nasdaq) in Centra| =
America.<BR>
<BR>
On January 19, 2005, in an effort to further enhance its management<BR>
team,<BR>

Russia<BR>
which was developed by Dr, Karpenkov in partnership with Milliken =
GMBH<BR>
