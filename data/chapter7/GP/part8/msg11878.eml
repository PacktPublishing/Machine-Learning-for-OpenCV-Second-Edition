Hi, it's Rachael again!
My email account wasnt functioning properly, maybe 
thats why I havn't heard anything from you yet :/  
I have been trying to get a hold of you, though I 
can never seem to send the email out with out doing 
something stupid. As you can see I am not that good 
with computers, or anything that has to do with 
technology, but I am starting to get the hang of it.
<br>
Anyways, the reason I am emailing you is because I 
have seen your profile on line. My website is finally 
ready with my new pictures and updates. Here is my website :

<br><br>
I hope you like what you see, I have been trying to 
get my self a modeling career but it seems as though 
people find something wrong with me ; (. Well. Hmmm, 
anyways If you do decide to get a hold of me, I have 
my email addy on my homepage. I am looking for someone 
who I can have a good conversation with, or anyone who 
wants to have a simple good time <|^_^|>
<br>
I hope we can get in touch. I am usually online. 
<br>
-kisses, Rachael
