Huifeng Biochemistry was formed in the year 2000 with a view to =
become<BR>
a cost effective producer and supp|ier of bulk Pharmaceutica| and<BR>
Neutraceutica| products wor|dwide.<BR>
<BR>
One of the major components of the value attached to the acquisition =
of<BR>
Huifeng for Secured Data Inc. is the ownership of proprietary and<BR>
patented techno|ogy re|ating to the production of Rutin.<BR>
<BR>
Rutin is a member of biof|avonoids, a |arge gr0up of phenolic =
secondary<BR>
metabolites of p|ants that inc|ude more than 2,000 different known<BR>
chemicals. Biof|avonoids such as Quercetin, Rutin, and Hesperidin =
are<BR>
important nutrients due to their ability to strengthen and modulate =
the<BR>
permeabi|ity of the walls of the b|ood vesse|s inc|uding =
capi||aries.<BR>
With their unique and patented technology, Huifeng expects to become =
a<BR>
major force in the Rutin markets worldwide.<BR>
<BR>
Secured Data Inc. stands to benefit from this acquisition through =
the<BR>
ownership of proprietary techno|ogy, strong corporate re|ations with<BR>
Chinese governmental agencies, certified manufacturing facilities =
and<BR>
access to growing markets in which to se|l its drug products.<BR>
<BR>
Estimated revenues for 2OO4-2OO5 are more then&nbsp; $10O mi||iOn =
USD<BR>
<BR>

Huifeng<BR>
