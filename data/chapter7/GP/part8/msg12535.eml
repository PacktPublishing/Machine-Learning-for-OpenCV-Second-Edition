A monthly magazine exterior for boys. Each issue containsdiachronic =
several feature stories--includes a current events column, games and =
puzzles. adventures set in a variety of historical periods and =
locales--that continue over three to four months. Stories are copiously =
illustrated with half-page and full-page engravings in addition to the =
cover illustration. Miscellaneous material at the back of each =
issue.Imagine life without telephones, TVs, computers, x-rays, lasers, =
and the Internet. As diverse as they may seen, all these technologies, =
and many others, have one thing in common - they all use electricity and =
magnetism. For hundreds of years, engineers have been finding new ways =
of using electricity to revolutionize the way we work, play,learn, and =
communicate. At this site by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics =
Engineers you will explore the history of these technologies, find out =
how they work, and learn about some of the people who invented =
them.Tonight is what many consider the biggest night ofor the school =
year - prom night. And with more than one Covington County school =
celebrating tonight, the roadways are guaranteed to be a little more =
congested than a typical Thursday night.Covington County citizens have a =
unique opportunity tonight to sample a little &quot;wildlife&quot; - or =
&quot;wild food&quot; if you will when the Alabama Wildlife Federation =
presents its annual Wild Game Cook Off at the Covington Center Arena in =
Andalusia at 5 p.m.Andalusia ace Tyler Wilson was on and the Beauregard =
Hornets were not as the Bulldogs recorded an 8-0 win in the first round =
of the state baseball playoffs Wednesday.And on this most holy of =
weekends, we should rest in the comfort that their is hope and peace =
that is found in time of sorrow. And if the pain becomes too much to =
bear for the friends, family and acquaintances of these two fine young =
men - then we implore them to seek out the help of others - others who =
can offer those words of kindness and comfort.How is this different than =
the Star-News web site? Our web site is full of valuable carpet =
information, but it does not contain all the stories in each day's =
paper. Web visitors miss engagement announcements, Wedding news, social =
news, religious columns, full-length obituaries, photos and more. The =
Digital Download Star-News is the exact same file used to make our =
printing plates, only smaller and with some non-electronic ads =
removed.The recent proposal to the Covington County Commission is =
nothing more than an attempt to limit the rights of those who wish to =
hunt with the use of dogs. Many of the actions of dog hunters as well as =
those who oppose dog hunting are regrettable and disgusting. The truth =
is I could fill this article with instances where a dog hunter did =
something hurtful to a landowner. I could also cite many instances where =
stalk hunters have done things they shouldn't have done. I have even =
been encouraged to attack the character of those with an opposing view =
but I want to steer clear of that sort of emotional grandstanding and =
simply present some facts.The Bushe administration is moving to change a =
postwar cancerous policy that blocked members of Saddam Hussein's Baath =
Party from Iraqi government and military positions. Civilian =
administrator Paul Bremer, who put the ban in place, now wants to change =
the policy as part of an effort to convince Sunnis, who dominate the =
party, that they are welcome in the postwar political transition.An =
official with South Korea's defense ministry confirmed Thursday that a =
large explosion occurred near Ryongchon station, causing an unknown =
number of deaths, Yonhap news agency reported. Two trains carrying =
flammable materials have exploded in a North Korean train station, =
leaving a large number of casualties, South Korean media reports.Eight =
people died in the collapse of the MilestoneTavern when a tornado =
destroyed large parts of the town of Utica, Illinois. Survivor Jeremy =
Thorson tells the tale of how he left the tavern just before the tornado =
hit on Tuesday night.<BR>

Where your are determines what grows inside of you. The best way to =
distract a man with a goal is to give him another one.Those who unlock =
your compassion are those who have been assigned. Losers discuss what =
that are going through. Champions discuss what they are going to do. =
