Eric B. Baum<BR>
MIT Press 478pp January 2004<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This reports on a 10+ year project to see whether what I viewed<BR>
as the worldview of the computational cognition (eg UAI) community<BR>
could extend in any plausible way to explain all the capabilities<BR>
of mind. I found such an extension, but only after being constrained<BR>
into conjectures that are at odds with what I would have expected.<BR>
<BR>
*What is Thought?* proposes a model that explains how mind is<BR>
equivalent to execution of a computer program, addressing<BR>
aspects such as understanding, meaning, creativity, language,<BR>
reasoning, learning, and consciousness; that is consistent<BR>
with extensive data from a variety of fields, and that has<BR>
empirical implications.<BR>
Meaning is seen as the computational exploitation of the compact<BR>
underlying structure of the world, and mind as execution of an<BR>
evolved program that is all about meaning. The formalizations of<BR>
Occam's Razor in the recent CS literature are extrapolated to<BR>
argue that meaning results from finding a compact<BR>
enough program behaving effectively in the world; such a program<BR>
can only be compact by virtue of code reuse, factoring into<BR>
interacting modules that capture real concepts and are reused<BR>
metaphorically. For a variety of reasons, including arguments<BR>
based on complexity theory, developmental biology, evolutionary<BR>
programming, ethology, and simple inspection, the compact Occam<BR>
program is most naturally seen to be in the DNA, rather than<BR>
the brain. Learning and reasoning are then fast and almost<BR>
automatic because they are constrained by the DNA programming<BR>
to deal only with meaningful quantities. Evolution itself is<BR>
argued to exploit meaning in related ways. Language, the failures<BR>
of AI programs to understand, the differences<BR>
between humans and apes, and Consciousness in all its many<BR>
aspects are naturally understood in this context, including<BR>
such &quot;hard&quot; issues as why execution of an evolved computer<BR>
program leads to qualia (our sensation of being).<BR>
<BR>
*What is Thought?* gives a pedagogical treatment of all<BR>
necessary background (including, e.g. the V-C, MDL, and<BR>
Bayesian Occam razors, complexity theory, and biology<BR>
as a computational process) and should be accessible to<BR>
science readers from a variety of backgrounds.<BR>

&gt;From the back cover:<BR>
<BR>
&quot;This book is the deepest, and at the same time the most<BR>
commonsensical, approach to the problem of mind and thought that<BR>
I have read.&nbsp; The approach is from the point of view of =
computer<BR>
science, yet Baum has no illusions about the progress which has<BR>
been made within that field. He presents the many technical<BR>
advances which have been made -- the book will be enormously<BR>
useful for this aspect alone -- but refuses to play down their<BR>
glaring inadequacies. He also presents a road map for getting<BR>
further and makes the case that many of the apparently 'deep'<BR>
philosophical problems such as free will may simply evaporate<BR>
when one gets closer to real understanding.&quot;<BR>
--Philip W. Anderson, Joseph Henry Professor of Physics, Princeton<BR>
University, 1977 Nobel Laureate in Physics<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Eric Baum's book is a remarkable achievement. He presents a =
novel<BR>
thesis -- that the mind is a program whose components are<BR>
semantically meaningful modules -- and explores it with a rich<BR>
array of evidence drawn from a variety of fields. Baum's argument<BR>
depends on much of the intellectual core of computer science, and<BR>
as a result the book can also serve as a short course in computer<BR>
science for non-specialists. To top it off, *What is Thought?* is<BR>
beautifully written and will be at least as clear and<BR>
accessible to the intelligent lay public as *Scientific =
American*.&quot;<BR>
--David Waltz, Director, Center for Computational Learning Systems,<BR>
Columbia University<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What's great about this book is the detailed way in which Baum<BR>
shows the explanatory power of a few ideas, such as compression<BR>
of information, the mind and DNA as computer programs, and<BR>
various concepts in computer science and learning theory such as<BR>
simplicity, recursion, and position evaluation. *What is Thought?*<BR>
is a terrific book, and I hope it gets the wide readership it =
deserves.&quot;<BR>
--Gilbert Harman, Department of Philosophy, Princeton University<BR>
<BR>
&quot;There is no problem more important, or more daunting, than<BR>
discovering the structure and processes behind human thought.<BR>
*What is Thought?* is an important step towards finding the answer.<BR>
A concise summary of the progress and pitfalls to date gives the<BR>
reader the context necessary to appreciate Baum's important insights<BR>
into the nature of cognition.&quot;<BR>

former Chief Technology Officer, Microsoft<BR>
