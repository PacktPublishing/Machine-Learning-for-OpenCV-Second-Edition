Two guys are out hunting deer...

The first guy says, "Did you see that?...pointing to the sky."
"No," the second guy says.
"Well, a bald eagle just flew overhead!" the first guy says.
"Oh," says the second guy.

A couple of minutes later, pointing to a far ridge, the first guy says, =
"Did you see that?"
"See what?" the second guy asks.
"Are you blind? There was a big, black bear walking on that hill, over =
there!"
"Yah, Ok", says the second guy again with a bit of irritation in his =
voice.

A few minutes later the first guy says: "Did you see that?"
This time pointing behind them.

By now, the second guy is getting very aggravated and says, "Yah, I SAW =
IT!"

And the first guy says: "Then why did you step in it?"
