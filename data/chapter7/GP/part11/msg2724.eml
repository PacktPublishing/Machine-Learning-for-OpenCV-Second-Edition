ERHC and Exxon Mobil exercise priority rights on highly sought after =
oil<BR>
blocks in Nigeria and Sao Tome's Joint Development&nbsp; Zone&nbsp; =
(JDZ)&nbsp; in&nbsp; the<BR>
Gulf of Guinea.<BR>
<BR>
Every major news wire service worldwide has carried hundreds of =
articles<BR>
revealing that the offshore oil blocks in this region contain 10&nbsp; =
to&nbsp; 15<BR>
Billion&nbsp; Barrels&nbsp; of&nbsp; Oil.&nbsp; The JDZ line-up tipped =
to take over upcoming<BR>
blocks&nbsp; includes&nbsp; Exxon&nbsp; Mobil,&nbsp; ERHC,&nbsp; =
Chevron&nbsp; Texaco,&nbsp; Amerada&nbsp; Hess,<BR>
and Anadarko.<BR>
<BR>
License approval for the&nbsp; region's&nbsp; Exclusive&nbsp; =
Economic&nbsp; Zone (EEZ) is a<BR>
multilateral deal securing blocks jointly&nbsp; involving Exxon =
Mobil,&nbsp; ERHC,<BR>
and Chevron Texaco.<BR>
<BR>
ERHC&nbsp; has jumped from a .25 cent stock earlier in the year to a .50 =
cent<BR>
stock that is headed for over $2&nbsp; or a possible buyout from one of =
their<BR>
JDZ multinational players.<BR>
<BR>
ERHC has been&nbsp; at&nbsp; the&nbsp; negotiating&nbsp; tables&nbsp; =
with&nbsp; the&nbsp; super-major&nbsp; oil<BR>
companies. It is impossible to measure the power that is carried where =
a<BR>
stock&nbsp; at this price level is a vital part of a key union of oil =
giants!<BR>
The top-level executives of the JDZ&nbsp; oil majors have been =
finalizing the<BR>
percentage&nbsp; awards&nbsp; with&nbsp; ERHC&nbsp; for&nbsp;&nbsp; =
official&nbsp;&nbsp; announcement&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; the<BR>
landmark-licensing round in the first 2 weeks of June.<BR>
<BR>
The&nbsp; US&nbsp; Government is pushing for increasing development of =
the area to<BR>
minimize Middle East dependence. The eyes of the world are watching =
with<BR>
record prices at the pump and oil busting through $40 per barrel.<BR>
<BR>
The oil companies will always make&nbsp; their $Billions - investors can =
cash<BR>
in by accumulating a substantial position just&nbsp; before&nbsp; =
earth-shattering<BR>
news is released that will send shock waves through ERHC.<BR>
<BR>
Investor Financial Times Report (IFTR) is an independent newsletter =
with<BR>
the&nbsp; goal&nbsp; of&nbsp; giving investors the necessary knowledge =
to make rational<BR>
and profitable investment decisions.&nbsp; This&nbsp; publication does =
not provide<BR>
an analysis of the company's financial position and is not an&nbsp; =
offer&nbsp; to<BR>
buy&nbsp; or&nbsp; sell&nbsp; securities.&nbsp; Investing&nbsp; in&nbsp; =
securities is speculative and<BR>
carries risk. It is recommended that any investment should be made =
after<BR>
consulting&nbsp; with&nbsp; your&nbsp; investment&nbsp;&nbsp; =
advisor&nbsp; and&nbsp; after&nbsp; reviewing&nbsp; the<BR>
financial statements of the company. IFTR presents information&nbsp; =
in&nbsp; this<BR>
online&nbsp; report&nbsp; believed&nbsp; to&nbsp; be&nbsp; =
reliable,&nbsp; but&nbsp; its accuracy cannot be<BR>
assured. Past performance does&nbsp; not&nbsp; insure similar future =
results. IFTR<BR>
is not purported to be a complete and thorough analysis of the&nbsp; =
featured<BR>
company&nbsp; and&nbsp; recommends&nbsp; a&nbsp; complete review of the =
Company's regulatory<BR>
filings&nbsp; at&nbsp; sec.gov.&nbsp; IFTR&nbsp; received&nbsp; =
seven&nbsp; thousand&nbsp; dollars&nbsp; from an<BR>
unaffiliated third party with respect to the preparation of this =
special<BR>
online report as an effort to build investor&nbsp; awareness&nbsp; =
for&nbsp; ERHC.&nbsp; The<BR>
information&nbsp; herein&nbsp; contains&nbsp; future-looking statements =
and information<BR>
within the meaning of&nbsp; Section&nbsp; 27A&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; =
Securities Act of 1933 and<BR>
Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including =
statements<BR>
regarding&nbsp; expected&nbsp; continual&nbsp;&nbsp; growth&nbsp;&nbsp; =
of&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; featured&nbsp;&nbsp; company.<BR>
Future-looking&nbsp; statements&nbsp; are&nbsp; based&nbsp; on&nbsp; =
expectations, estimates, and<BR>
projections at the time the statements are made that involve a number =
of<BR>
risks and&nbsp; uncertainties&nbsp; which&nbsp; could&nbsp; cause&nbsp; =
actual&nbsp; results to differ<BR>
materially from those presently anticipated.<BR>
