The difference between involvement and commitment is like an =
eggs-and-ham breakfast: the chicken was involved - the pig was =
committed. - unknown <br> Egotist: a person more interested in himself =
than in me. - Ambrose Bierce (1842-1914) <br> A husband is what is left =
of the lover after the nerve has been extracted. - Helen Rowland =
(1876-1950)
