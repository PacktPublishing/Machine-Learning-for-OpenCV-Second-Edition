How's your credit?<p>
To finance anything, home or car, credit is all that matters.  RAISE =
your credit score in 30 days.<p>
The three main credit bureaus gather your personal information and sell =
it for a fee.  The Fair Credit Reporting Act gives the consumer (you) =
the right to contest items on your report. You may think that things =
have to remain on your report for seven years. That is a lie.  The =
problem is that The Fair Credit Report Act gives YOU rights. If you =
choose not to excercise your rights then negative items will continue to =
damage your credit.<p>

credit repair can work for you</a>
