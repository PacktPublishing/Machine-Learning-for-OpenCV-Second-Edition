It's been a rough week for you and your honey, I know. Prince Charles =
is<BR>
said to be mighty peeved that the wedding had to be postponed for a day =
so<BR>
that he could go to the pope's funeral. (What, they can't hold funerals =
on<BR>
Thursday at the Vatican?) All the papers were blathering on about =
it:<BR>
&quot;Camilla's Big Day Is Jinxed,&quot; blared the headline in the =
Daily Express. &quot;No<BR>
Wedding and a Funeral,&quot; chortled the Daily Mirror.<BR>
Federer's victory only enhanced his astonishing risumi, which includes =
four<BR>
Grand Slam titles. Federer, the two-time defending champion at =
Wimbledon,<BR>
won all but the French Open last year.<BR>
<BR>
Flooding from a weekend of drenching rain forced thousands of people =
from<BR>
their homes in New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania and closed the =
New<BR>
Jersey Statehouse on Monday.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It was like someone was taking a squeegee and just pushing the =
water<BR>
forward,&quot; said Bertram King, 20, one of about 15 people evacuated =
from a<BR>
homeless shelter in Easton, Pa.<BR>
