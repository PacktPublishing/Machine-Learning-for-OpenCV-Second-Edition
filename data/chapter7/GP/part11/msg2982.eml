<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Hi, this is Christine replying back. I think you were =
referred by a friend of the website. Are you new to dating housewives? =
They are some pretty hot girls in there but I'd like to show you what =
I'm about on my webcam first. I live in within your area code so maybe =
we could hook up after as well. Anyways, hope to hear from you =
soon...<BR>
