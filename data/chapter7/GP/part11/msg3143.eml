Wall  Street  Money  Report  discovers  leading  edge  Entertainment<br>
Company preparing for  blockbuster  new  release! KDSC positioned as<br>
the #1 stock investment in children's  entertainment  for  years  to =
come.<br>
Over  the  past  decade, Disney and Warner Brothers have perfected a<br>
proven  formula  in  the  entertainment  industry  that consistently<br>
delivers over $100 Milli0n per film  release.   Box  office  results<br>
have shown that animated features and movies geared toward a younger<br>
audience  are  genuine  profit  makers  with movie-goers starved for<br>
quality G-rated family entertainment.<br>
<br>
By enhancing this model  for  success,  KidSational, Inc.  (KDSC) is<br>
building a solid platform in the  most  pr0fitable  segment  of  all<br>
mainstream  movies  -  typically  5X  more  profitable  than  a  big<br>
production film. Through skillful management and product depth, KDSC<br>
is  rapidly  becoming  a diversified entertainment empire, poised to<br>
become one of the leaders in this industry.<br>
Fueled by recent positive developments  and the revenue power of its<br>
product line, KidSational is on track during the month of August  to<br>
finalize   negotiations   with   leading   Hollywood  producers  and<br>
executives to bring "The Guardians" movie to the Big Screen. KDSC is<br>
moving forward with lightning speed as evidenced by their developing<br>
relationships with specialists  in  entertainment  law and top music<br>
tour management, motion picture producers, executive  producers  and<br>
distributors,  and  the selection of product placement and marketing =
experts.<br>
<br>
KDSC's initial motion picture  is  entitled "The Guardians - Masters<br>
of the Electro-World", based on adolescent super  heroes  along  the<br>
lines  of  Mighty  Morphin  Power  Rangers  and Teenage Mutant Ninja<br>
Turtles, who  have  collectively  produced  revenues  exceeding $500<br>
Milli0n.  One clear advantage for KDSC is that  "The  Guardians"  is<br>
scheduled  to  feature  TV and movie industry stars, giving the film<br>
that extra boost of  mass  appeal.  KDSC's  theater release is based<br>
upon the theme and characters in the nationally available Guardian's<br>
board game (100% owned by KDSC) which is used in over 400 elementary<br>
schools and has been  featured  on  a  major  nationally  syndicated<br>
afternoon TV talk show.<br>
<br>
Judging  by  the  numbers, major full length films of this type that<br>
reach out not just to  kids  but  entire families, have enjoyed huge<br>
box office success. This  is  based  on  a  release  of  over  1,000<br>
screens,  right  in line with Company expectations for their premier<br>
in just the  US  alone.   But  the  box  office  revenues are only a<br>
fraction of the huge income that is typically realized from a  film.<br>
To  maximize  PR0FITS,  KDSC  is  also  securing multiple streams of<br>
promotional revenue from food chains  and a major shoe manufacturer,<br>
a completed licensing agreement with DLI in Georgia  to  manufacture<br>
apparel for a branded product line of children's wear, and a variety<br>
of  products  available at the retail level all based upon the film.<br>
Everything from action figures,  clothing, toys, to children's party<br>
favors and lunch boxes are scheduled for national  merchandising  in<br>
order to extend the brand and generate revenue.<br>
<br>
If  this  were  the  whole  story,  it  would be more than enough to<br>
justify a strong b'uy  REC0MMENDATION  for KDSC. However, this isn't<br>
even the tip of the iceberg. The really big income will most  likely<br>
be  in VCR/DVD sales after the movie has run in theaters. Anyone who<br>
has small  children  or  grandchildren  knows  that  the  VCR/DVD is<br>
today's electronic baby sitter. Children watch films over  and  over<br>
again memorizing all the songs and story lines. It is very realistic<br>
by today's standards to see video and DVD sales hit the $100 Milli0n<br>
mark,  especially  with  the availability at retail super-stores and<br>
the Internet. One  of  the  most  magnificent facts about children's<br>
movies is that a new generation is  born  every  7  years  to  enjoy<br>
re-releases as well as home video.<br>
KDSC's  Music Division is red-hot, featuring the new urban/pop music<br>
sensation "TGK".  This  GR0UP  of  Y0UNG  superstars currently has a<br>
nationwide advance release of a new single from their  CD  in  major<br>
music  retail stores, which has already jumped into the top 20. KDSC<br>
is enjoying  the  ultimate  in  cross-over  entertainment success by<br>
featuring the music of TGK  in  the  soundtrack  for  The  Guardians<br>
movie.  TGK  has been receiving major radio airplay while performing<br>
worldwide, and promotes  only  a  positive  message with no negative<br>
lyrics in their music.<br>
<br>
KDSC has cemented partnerships that will enhance their entertainment<br>
products,in-crease distribution  channels,  and  accelerate  growth.<br>
Dynamic  PR0FITS  are  realized  in  the  early  growth  stages of a<br>
burgeoning entertainment company that  has  nailed the blueprint for<br>
success. Savvy investors with an eye for value can benefit from  the<br>
tremendous  PR0FITS  that  will launch the f0rtunes of this new film<br>
and entertainment powerhouse.<br>
