<p>In a rapidly-changing industry, current healthcare information is an =
<br>
  invaluable resource to businesses and organizations. The United States =
<br>
  Healthcare Database includes comprehensive information on more than =
<br>
  7,000 hospitals, 25,000 nursing homes and 400,000 doctors. It is the =
<br>
  most extensive and reliable mailing list and database of key decision =
<br>
  makers in the health care market.<br>
  <br>
  Each record is indexed by such features as name, address, phone and =
fax. <br>
  The database is available in Excel format on CD Rom. It is designed =
for <br>

<br>
  criteria such as type of practice. It can be used on an unlimited =
basis.</p>

  updated every quarter. MedCom continues to hold the nation's most <br>
  extensive and reliable databases of key decision-makers in the health =
<br>
  care market.<br>
  <br>
  Available exclusively on CD-Rom (Excel), the data can be used on an =
<br>
  unlimited basis. It is easily exportable to other programs for mailing =
<br>
  or faxing purposes.</p>
