<a href=3D"http://6555.biz/anastasia/main.php?RID=3Dsexyme">A blind man =
walks into a bar, taps the man next him, and says, "Hey, wanna hear a =
blond joke?" The man says back to the blind man, "Look buddy, I'm blond. =
The man behind me is a 400-pound professional wrestler and he is blond. =
The bouncer is blond. The man sitting over to your left is also blond. =
Still wanna tell that blond joke?" The blind man is silent for a moment =
and then says, "Nah, I wouldn't want to have to explain it five =
times."</a> </FONT></p>
