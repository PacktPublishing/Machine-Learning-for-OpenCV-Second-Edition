COMPANY PROFILE<BR>
<BR>
American Resource Management, Inc., through its wholly-owned subsidiary, =
Efficiency Technologies, Inc. (&quot;EffTec&quot;) is a Tulsa, Oklahoma =
based company dedicated to developing energy efficiency monitoring =
programs for commercial/industrial HVAC systems principally made up of =
centrifugal chillers and boilers.&nbsp; Centrifugal chillers are the =
single largest energy-using components in most facilities and can =
typically consume more than 50% of the total electrical usage.&nbsp; =
Centrifugal chillers running inefficiently result in substantially =
higher energy costs, decreased equipment reliability and shortened =
lifespan.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
EffTec has developed a powerful, easy-to-use, online diagnostic service =
called EffHVAC that gives facilities the ability to document, monitor, =
evaluate and manage centrifugal chiller system performance.&nbsp; =
EffHVAC created detailed reports that contain a wealth of information =
that can be used to improve operations and save thousands of dollars in =
utility costs.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
EffTec offers comprehensive and flexible HVAC consulting and =
training.&nbsp; Our team consists of industry-recognized experts in HVAC =
system design, efficiency, preventive and proactive maintenance, repair, =
chemistry, computer programming and marketing.&nbsp; Combine EffHVAC =
with our consulting services and start developing a world-class HVAC =
program to improve your bottom line.&nbsp;<BR>
