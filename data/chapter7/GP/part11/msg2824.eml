Rather than wasting bullets, megalomaniacs prefer to kill their enemies =
using complex machinery. The farm was used to produce produce. Candidate =
explained that her long-term goals was to replace the interviewer. The =
employers were also asked to list the "most unusual" questions that have =
been asked by job candidates. You grind your coffee beans in your mouth.
The soldier decided to desert his dessert in the desert. However if you =
are overweight, your mascara will run and your lipstick will smear. The =
soldier decided to desert his dessert in the desert. I like tall women. =
Unless you make the mistake of showing someone a  picture of your =
sweetheart back home.

At times I have the strong urge to do something harmful or shocking. You =
can type sixty words per minute with your feet. Candidate fell and broke =
arm during interview. "I know this is off the subject, but will you =
marry me?" You can take a picture of yourself from ten feet away without =
using the timer.
"Will the company pay to relocate my horse?" I must admit that I am a =
pretty fair talker. "I know this is off the subject, but will you marry =
me?" Should you wish to pass yourself off as a German officer, it is not =
necessary to speak the language. "Do you think the company would be =
willing to lower my pay?"
Police departments give their officers personality tests to make sure =
each is assigned a partner. The soldier decided to desert his dessert in =
the desert. But only to the waist of the man lying beside her. Honest =
and hard-working policemen are usually gunned down a day or two before =
retirement. Heut will wince when a woman tries to clean his wounds.
You're so jittery that people use your hands to blend their margaritas. =
If you are blonde and pretty, it is possible to be a world-famous expert =
on anything, at the age of 22. "Why aren't you in a more interesting =
business?" Applicant interrupted interview to phone her therapist for =
advice on how to answer specific interview questions. You grind your =
coffee beans in your mouth.
