for more than a century as the most productive gold-bearing areas in
the NW Mining District of  Guyana,  as  well  as for its recent gold
production from artisanal mining methods.  The White Creek  property

order of tens of ounces of gold per ton. A significant number of old
shafts  and  drifts  (over  30)  were  identified in the area always
