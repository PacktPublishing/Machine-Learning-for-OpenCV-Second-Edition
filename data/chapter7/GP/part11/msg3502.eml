<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>My name is Jill :)&nbsp; Many times I feel weird, even =
my girlfriends told me that .... checked few websites and decided<BR>
to open a website about me.&nbsp; My girlfriends want to join me to on =
my website. -) You just need to verify your age at no charge and that's =
it, don't want to get kicked out of college if minors view it ;)<BR>
