Gen'er1c Vi'a'gra have made my dreams come true. <br>
I always knew I had a smaller p'e'nis than all the other <br>
guys and it really made me feel insecure about myself. <br>

But when I came across Ge'ne'ric V'ia'gra's website I knew <br>
I had to try it and to my surprise it worked! No longer do <br>
I feel shy when I go to a public toilet or crack jokes about <br>
small pe,nis,es because mine is huge now and I'm so proud of it. <br>

I met a girl not long ago; we went on a few dates and had the <br>
best s.e'x ever! I never had a girl scream and moan at me so much! <br>
