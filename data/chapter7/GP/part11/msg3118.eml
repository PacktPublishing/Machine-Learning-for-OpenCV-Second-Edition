po box in link above and you can say no thank you for future<BR>

Perhaps the genius noticed this rudeness, for he continued: I regret, =
of<BR>
course, that you are a boy instead of a grown man, for it will =
appear<BR>
singular to your friends that so thoughtless a youth should seemingly =
have<BR>
mastered the secrets that have baffled your most learned scientists. =
But<BR>
that can not be helped, and presently you will become, through my aid, =
the<BR>
most powerful and wonderful personage in all the world<BR>
Thank you, said Rob, meekly<BR>
