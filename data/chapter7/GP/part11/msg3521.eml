, 2004 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Niche Media Ventures, Inc. (Pink Sheets:NTVI) =
is distributing the new album entitled &quot;Pilar&quot; by Latin pop =
princess Pilar Montenegro. Pilar's recently released album has already =
reached #34 in the Billboard Latin Album chart with sales of over 38,000 =
units to date (almost 12,000 units have been reported by Soundscan.)<BR>
<BR>
Niche Media current distribution of this album provides Niche Media with =
the opportunity of taking a more active role in the development of this =
exciting artist. Pilar is one of a growing number of performers who no =
longer desire to be associated with a major label record company. NMV =
has the infrastructure to absorb these acts at little or no cost and get =
them into national distribution with varying levels of =
participation.<BR>
<BR>
In addition to complete national distribution, Niche Media Ventures also =
has the ability to replicate CDs and DVDs, author those DVDs, and =
provide streaming media and web hosting services to its artists and =
business partners. This infrastructure allows an independent artist with =
the ability to produce and distribute their work in a cost effective =
manner.<BR>
