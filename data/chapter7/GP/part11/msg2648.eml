<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>This is the newest and only item that can =
descramble<BR>
digital cable. It is also a universal product.<BR>
Almost all digital cable boxes will work with the<BR>
Power Filter; including Motorola, General<BR>
Instruments DCT, Pioneer, Scientific Atlanta<BR>
Explorer Series, and more.<BR>
<BR>
Remember, this is not able cable, it is a<BR>
descrambler and decoder filter.<BR>
It plugs into your current digital box.<BR>
It will allow you to receive channels that you would<BR>
normally pay a premium for and you can order with<BR>
your remote control.<BR>
<BR>
We have a small Digital Filter and Lockup Buster<BR>
combo that easily fits on the back of your<BR>
receiver so you can test your Pay-per-View<BR>
for Movies, Live Sporting Events, Concerts, etc,<BR>
without paying a dime.<BR>
This is 100% legal as it is used as reception<BR>
enhancer device!<BR>
