A liar begins with making falsehood appear like truth, and ends with =
making truth itself appear like falsehood.If a fellow wants to be a =
nobody in the business world, let him neglect sending the mail man to =
somebody on his behalf.Talk that does not end in any kind of action is =
better suppressed altogether.<BR>
