Penny Stock Spotlight sharply&nbsp; focuses&nbsp; on&nbsp; OTCBB&nbsp; =
companies&nbsp; that have made a<BR>
dramatic business turnaround and are now successful market leaders with =
strong<BR>
numbers behind them.<BR>
<BR>
Our Stock in the Spotlight is RS GR0UP&nbsp; of&nbsp; Companies,&nbsp; =
Inc.&nbsp; (BB:&nbsp; RSGC).&nbsp; By<BR>
taking&nbsp; a&nbsp; page&nbsp; from&nbsp; BILLI0NAIRE&nbsp; Warren =
Buffet's playbook and following the<BR>
Berkshire Hathaway model of&nbsp; acquiring&nbsp; or&nbsp; =
&quot;rolling-up&quot; high margin specialty<BR>
insurers, RSGC is racking up record sales and hardwired for PR0FITS.<BR>
<BR>
RS GR0UP of Companies, Inc. (RSGC)<BR>
Rating: Strong B'uy<BR>
Shares Outstanding: 15.2 MILLI0N<BR>
Recommended Price: .95<BR>
Estimated 60-Day High: 2.40<BR>
<BR>
Major Breaking News: RSGC Completes Placement of&nbsp; $300&nbsp; =
MILLI0N&nbsp; Capacity&nbsp; for<BR>
M0RTGAGE&nbsp; Indemnity In-surance Program Estimated to Result in Gross =
Revenue of<BR>
$9 MILLI0N Over 12 Months.<BR>
<BR>
RSGC is thriving in the&nbsp; ideal&nbsp; economic environment enabling =
the M0RTGAGE and<BR>
in-surance sector to generate huge PR0FITS. RS GR0UP's&nbsp; recent =
accomplishments<BR>
are turning heads in the specialty in-surance and reinsurance =
industry,as well<BR>
as&nbsp; capturing&nbsp; the&nbsp; profit-making&nbsp; attention&nbsp; =
of aggressive investors. We have<BR>
witnessed this&nbsp; Company&nbsp; evolve&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; =
last&nbsp; 60&nbsp; days&nbsp; into a strategically<BR>
positioned powerhouse by securing $15 MILLI0N plus&nbsp; in&nbsp; =
sales,&nbsp; equivalent&nbsp; to<BR>
$1.00 per share in revenue.<BR>
<BR>
Following&nbsp; RS&nbsp; GR0UP's latest quarterly filing, the Company =
has re-ceived $8.5<BR>
MILLI0N in equity financing from institutional investors; these are the =
&quot;smart<BR>
money&quot; players that hold long term&nbsp; and&nbsp; recognize a =
company on the fast track<BR>
for exponential&nbsp; growth.&nbsp; The&nbsp; influence&nbsp; of&nbsp; =
the&nbsp; Berkshire&nbsp; Hathaway&nbsp; empire<BR>
(trading&nbsp; at&nbsp; over&nbsp; $80,000 per share), and built upon =
the explosive cash flow<BR>
from 3 in-surance subsidiaries (National Indemnity,GEICO, and General =
Re), has<BR>
had a commanding effect on&nbsp; RSGC's&nbsp; successful penetration =
into the Lloyd's of<BR>
London in-surance market with 2 major acquisitions&nbsp; and&nbsp; an =
underwriting&nbsp; line<BR>
with a founding member firm.<BR>
<BR>
Specifically,&nbsp; RSGC has secured $1.6 BILLI0N in underwriting =
availability from<BR>
Tyser and Co. (founded&nbsp; in&nbsp; 1820),&nbsp; the&nbsp; oldest =
independent continuous trading<BR>
firm of Lloyd's brokers. This binding agreement targets a market =
comprised&nbsp; of<BR>
38&nbsp; million&nbsp; housing&nbsp; units&nbsp; in the US and Canada. =
RSGC swiftly enrolled 1,600<BR>
housing&nbsp; units&nbsp; upon&nbsp; its&nbsp; recent&nbsp; =
start-up&nbsp; which&nbsp; represents&nbsp; a&nbsp; very&nbsp; small<BR>
percentage of&nbsp; the&nbsp; total&nbsp; units&nbsp; qualifying =
for&nbsp; this&nbsp; proprietary in-surance<BR>
product. Even so, just the initial sales alone will impact the bottom =
line&nbsp; by<BR>
generating an estimated $800,000 in revenue.<BR>
<BR>
RSGC has completed the purchase of 49% of Dashwood, Brewer, and Phipps =
Ltd., a<BR>
70-year&nbsp;&nbsp; old&nbsp; Lloyd's&nbsp; of&nbsp; London =
in-surance&nbsp; leader&nbsp; maintaining&nbsp; consistent<BR>
profitability. Based&nbsp; on&nbsp; Dashwood's&nbsp; negotiated&nbsp; =
underwriting&nbsp; commitments in<BR>
support of RSGC products, gross premiums earned by the Company&nbsp; =
&quot;are&nbsp; expected<BR>
to&nbsp; be&nbsp; approximately&nbsp; $58.5&nbsp; Million.&quot;&nbsp; =
Expansion&nbsp; is&nbsp; currently&nbsp; underway to<BR>
in-crease&nbsp; pooled&nbsp; capacity&nbsp;&nbsp; which&nbsp;&nbsp; =
will&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;facilitate&nbsp;&nbsp; gross&nbsp; revenues&nbsp; =
of<BR>
approximately $400 MILLI0N.&quot; We are not the first to uncover&nbsp; =
this&nbsp; phenomenon<BR>
as&nbsp; the&nbsp; stock&nbsp; is&nbsp; under accumulation, but we are =
acting aggressively on this<BR>
recently filed data.<BR>
<BR>
Any company producing&nbsp; revenues&nbsp; at&nbsp; this&nbsp; =
extraordinary&nbsp; pace&nbsp; is going to be<BR>
eagerly pursued by investors along with&nbsp; rapid&nbsp; analyst&nbsp; =
coverage&nbsp; and&nbsp; broker<BR>
participation.&nbsp; Investors&nbsp; need&nbsp; to react quickly and =
secure sizable positions<BR>
before word spreads and stock&nbsp; prices&nbsp; explode. Additional =
contracts are being<BR>
negotiated and the revenues just keep piling up for an undervalued gem =
that is<BR>
taking off and ready to run. With an&nbsp; average&nbsp; PE&nbsp; =
for&nbsp; the&nbsp; industry&nbsp; between<BR>
16-18, analysts would view a $2.00 price projection as conservative.<BR>
<BR>
Required&nbsp; RSGC information: Penny Stock Spotlight is an independent =
newsletter<BR>
with the goal of giving investors the necessary knowledge to make =
rational and<BR>
profitable investment decisions. This publication does not provide an =
analysis<BR>
of the company's&nbsp; financial&nbsp; position&nbsp; and&nbsp; is&nbsp; =
not&nbsp; an&nbsp; 0FFER to b'uy or sell<BR>
securities. Investing in securities is speculative and&nbsp; =
carries&nbsp; risk.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is<BR>
recommended&nbsp; that&nbsp; any&nbsp; investment&nbsp; should&nbsp; be =
made after consulting with your<BR>
investment&nbsp; advisor&nbsp; and&nbsp; after&nbsp; reviewing&nbsp; =
the&nbsp; financial&nbsp; statements&nbsp; of the<BR>
company. Penny Stock Spotlight presents&nbsp; information&nbsp; in&nbsp; =
this&nbsp; online&nbsp; report<BR>
believed&nbsp; to be reliable, but its accuracy cannot be assured. Past =
performance<BR>
does not insure similar future results. Penny Stock Spotlight is not =
purported<BR>
to be a complete and thorough&nbsp; analysis of the featured company and =
recommends<BR>
a complete review of the Company's regulatory filings at sec.gov. =
Penny&nbsp; Stock<BR>
Spotlight re-ceived&nbsp; twenty&nbsp; thousand dollars from an =
unaffiliated third party<BR>
with respect to the preparation of this&nbsp; special online report as =
an effort to<BR>
build investor awareness for RSGC. The information&nbsp; reported&nbsp; =
herein&nbsp; contains<BR>
future-looking statements and information within the meaning of Section =
27A of<BR>
the&nbsp; Securities&nbsp; Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities =
Exchange Act of<BR>
1934, including statements regarding expected continual growth of the =
featured<BR>
company. Future-looking statements are&nbsp; based&nbsp; on =
expectations, estimates, and<BR>
projections at the time the statements are made that involve a number of =
risks<BR>
and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ&nbsp; =
materially&nbsp; from<BR>
those presently anticipated.<BR>
