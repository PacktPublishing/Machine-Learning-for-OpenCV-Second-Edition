<p><font color=3D"#43618B">I thought of all the joy I had given this =
family. The happy little boy and his kite. The father and his newspaper. =
Crumbling it up she looked around to see who could be guilty one. Lacey, =
a dark haired girl that had carmel highlights smirked when their eyes =
met. I was jolted back to reality when I crashed.<br> <br>It rained and =
I got wet. I was miserable. I wished none of this had ever happened. I =
was then shipped off to a store. After about a week, a man bought me. =
She read me and then put me on the stump as she packed up her picnic. =
But she forgot me. I sat there for days. </font></p>
