>From the Investor's Point of View:<br>
<br>
China is the world's most vibrant and rapidly growing economic markets =
with=20
annual economic growth that has averaged more than 10% over the past two =

decades. With a GDP of roughly 6.5 trillion (measured in Purchasing =
Power=20
Parity), China is the world's second largest economy behind only the =
United=20
States in size. And, while other Asian economies are only slowly =
emerging from a=20
long recession, China's economy continues to grow at a rapid pace, with =
China=20
recently surpassing the US in consumption of every basic food, energy, =
and=20
industrial commodity except for oil.<br>
<br>
Infrastructure investment has provided a major impetus to Chinese =
economic=20
growth, and the government has successfully used state-directed =
investment in=20
infrastructure projects to lay the foundation for rapid, sustained =
economic=20
growth while stimulating near-term prosperity. According to investment =
bank=20
Morgan Stanley, in 2002 China spent more than 260 billion on =
electricity,=20
transportation, construction, telecom and real estate infrastructure, a =
figure=20
which is expected to increase apace with overall economic growth.<br>
<br>
As China enters the twenty-first century, its economy is the envy of the =
world.=20
To sustain this economic growth massive investment in infrastructure is =
needed=20
to foster continued expansion- creating a huge opportunity for investors =
in=20
Chinese companies to reap huge rewards. Since last May, Chinese stocks =
have seen=20
tremendous growth and made early investors huge profits. Over that =
period, we=20
have seen a number of Chinese stocks such as BYH, GSH, JCC, and YZC post =
average=20
price gains of more than 130%!!! With this in mind, we would like to =
introduce=20
you to our latest discovery, a company which is poised to reap huge =
profits from=20
the Chinese economic and infrastructure boom, TTCH China, Inc.<br>
<br>
<br>
About the Company:<br>
<br>
TTCH China, Inc. (OTC Pink Sheets: T*T*C*H), through its subsidiary =
Tianjin=20
Tianlian Composite Material Company, Ltd. (TTCH), is a leading Chinese=20
manufacturer of glass reinforced piping (GRP) and associated products. =
TTCH has=20
supplied nearly 600 km (375 miles) of glass reinforced pipes for a wide =
range of=20
major municipal and regional infrastructure projects throughout China. =
With 2004=20
sales in excess of 10 million, TTCH has established a domestic market =
share of=20
over 30% in China. The Company is rapidly growing its domestic =
operations, and=20
is well positioned to benefit from the ongoing infrastructure boom in =
China and=20
preparations for the 2008 Beijing Olympics; and is bidding on a number =
of major=20
water and sewage projects including one which requires more than 400 km =
of water=20
pipelines and a budget of 182 million. <br>
<br>
<br>
Investment Highlights:<br>
<br>
TTCH China, Inc. (OTC Pink Sheets: T*T*C*H) is a proven and profitable =
performer=20
in the white hot Chinese infrastructure market with a sizeable customer =
base and=20
established reputation preparing for an aggressive entry into lucrative=20
international markets.<br>
<br>
-TTCH has established itself as a major provider of glass reinforced =
plastic=20
pipes (GRP) with Chinese market share of over 30%. Since inception, TTCH =
has=20
supplied over 600 km of pipes to major projects throughout China.<br>
<br>
-TTCH's suite of GRP products offer significant advantages over =
traditional=20
pipes with improved performance, strength, durability, and cost.<br>
<br>
-TTCH is poised to dramatically grow its revenues in China, with the =
addition of=20
a number of lucrative new project wins. TTCH is bidding on a number of =
new=20
projects for the 2008 Beijing Olympics including one which will require =
400km of=20
water pipelines with a total budget of 182 million.<br>
<br>
-TTCH is undertaking an aggressive international expansion program with =
planned=20
entry into US and other key international markets. The Company has =
already=20
established relationships with key buyers in Singapore, the Middle East, =
Central=20
Asia, and South Africa, and plans to enter the US market in the =
near-term=20
period.<br>
<br>
-TTCH has an impressive revenue and earnings base with 2004 sales of 11 =
million=20
and earnings of roughly 1.8 million. We expect TTCH to grow these =
revenues to=20
35-40 million in 2005, and 55-60 million in 2006.<br>
<br>
<br>
Summing it up For the Investor:<br>
<br>
TTCH China, Inc. is one of the most exciting new opportunities in =
Chinese equity=20
investment, and with significant revenues, a dominant Chinese market =
share, and=20
a reputation for quality products, is exceptionally well positioned to =
see major=20
gains over the near-term with major Chinese and international expansion =
plans.=20
To get an idea of how profitable this opportunity could be for you, =
consider the=20
following: Comparable plastic pipe manufacturers trade at an average P/E =
of 22x.=20
Based on conservative 2005 financial expectations, this would translate =
into a=20
4.50 stock---in less than a year!!! But this chance won't last long; it =
is only=20
a matter of time before the Street takes notice of this Stock!<br>
