DEPARTMENT OF MINERALS AND ENERGY<BR>
PRETORIA, SOUTH AFRICA.<BR>
22ND JUNE&nbsp; 2004<BR>
<BR>
Dear Friend,<BR>
<BR>
It is my great pleasure to write you this letter on behalf of my =
colleagues.<BR>
Your information was given to me by a member of the South African Export =
Promotion Council (SAEPC) who was with the Government delegation on a =
trip to your country for a United Nations bilateral conference talk on =
sustainable development to encourage foreign investors. I have decided =
to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of a deal =
hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it =
confidential because of the nature of the business.<BR>
<BR>
Within the Department of Minerals and Energy where I work as an =
assistant Director of Audit, with the co-operation of two other top =
officials, we have in our possession an overdue contractor payment in US =
Dollars funds. The said funds represent certain percentage of the =
contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign =
contracting firm, (Pearls Ltd) which we the officials over-invoiced to =
the amount of US$15,200,000 (Fifteen Million Two Hundred Thousand US =
Dollars).<BR>
<BR>
Since the present elected Government is determined to pay foreign =
contractors all debts owed, so as to maintain good relations with =
foreign governments and non-governmental agencies, we included our bills =
for approvals with the Department of Finance and the Reserve Bank of =
South Africa (RBSA). We are 100% sure of funds approvals to anyone or =
company we (The Audit Committee) recommend as part of the =
sub-contractors who did jobs for the Department. We are seeking your =
assistance to front as the sub-contractor of the unclaimed funds, since =
we are not allowed to operate foreign accounts. Details and change of =
beneficiary information upon application for claim to reflect payment =
and approvals will be secured on behalf of you/your Company.<BR>
<BR>
My colleagues and I are prepared to give you US$2.28m while we take =
US$12.16m and the balance of US$760.000 thousand for taxes and =
miscellaneous expenses incurred.<BR>
<BR>
This business is completely safe and secure, provided you treat it with =
utmost confidentiality. It does not matter whether you/your Company does =
contract projects, as a transfer of rights will be secured in favour of =
you/your Company through the Federal High Court of South Africa before =
we can proceed.<BR>
I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not =
disappoint us. Kindly notify me immediately via&nbsp; my private email =
(zuma@web-mail.com.ar) or efax # 1 763 647 1984 for further details upon =
your acceptance of this proposal.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Yours Faithfully,<BR>
<BR>
Isaac Zuma (Mr)<BR>
