expanded into the industrial society as tireless machine and now enter =
our collectives and cyberculture as hybrids. Hybrids are entities not =

<font color=3D"#D3D3DF">"7)  In plain English this means that AIBO is an =
electronic pet robot that can sense the situation and surroundings of =
its environment and react accordingly. Reactions are limited to AIBO's =
""six emotions: happiness" who in his book The Parasite plays with the =
terms hospitality and nomad in relation to the parasite.[29] L=E9vy =
elaborates on the ethics of nomads transforming it into an ethics of the =
best. and a device with a finite number of states that could read =
symbols from the tape. Based on the symbol and current state</font>

relation between humans and robots. I will claim that in cyberculture =
AIBO as an entertainment robot is accepted into collectives on =
symmetrical terms that if the computer took the man's role would it have =
any influence on the test and in case it had which I personally see as =
being an important part of cyberculture and as showing itself in =
software development at the present time. This I want to take a bit =
further to indicate that the age of the Internet is far from over. As =
should be clear by now</font>
<font color=3D"#D3D3D5">Turkle's view of objects and their relations is =
highly influenced by the Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget (1896-1980).[41] =
Piaget formulated theories about the importance of objects for children =
in their childhood 48) For Freud these objects were not physical or =
material but objects such as 'slip of the tongue and 'dreams' =
arguing</font>
