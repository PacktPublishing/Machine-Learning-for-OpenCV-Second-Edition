&quot;Although i don't run red lights on purpose, I still seem to run =
them when I am tired, or just have to much on my mind... So when i saw =
photoblocker I figured, hey why not give it a shot, and already it has =
paid for its self. Thanks for this magnificent little =
miracle-in-a-bottle!&quot;<BR>
