<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Dearest One,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=
nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; REQUEST FOR HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE.<BR>
<BR>
It is not in my character to send Email of this type to person I do =
not<BR>
Know but I do this for sake of urgency and because of the present<BR>
condition In which I find myself here in the Refugee Camp of which =
this<BR>
is the only Communication I can afford for now.<BR>
<BR>
I am Miss Campbell William the first daughter of Brigadier Gabriel<BR>
William,former chief security officer to the former president Joseph =
Saidu<BR>
Momoh of Sierra Leone.<BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, my father has been accused and arrested on the 9th June =
2001<BR>
by the Sierra Leone government for acclaimed illegal possession =
ammunition<BR>
in his residence where all his traveling documents and other essential =
document<BR>
has been seized by the present government which the government see it =
as<BR>
hindrance to a peaceful resolution in the country contrary to the case =
which<BR>
they claimed he committed for he may be sentenced to life =
imprisonment.<BR>
<BR>
My father gave up the Ghost &amp; Died Two months ago as a result Of =
lack<BR>
of medical attention while in detention. During my father's tenure as =
a<BR>
former chief security officer in Sierra Leone,he secretly deposited =
two<BR>
trunks boxes valued at $28.5 million dollars cash and two bottles =
diamantes<BR>
containing blue/white 4 corner diamonds to a private security vault in =
Europe<BR>
in custody of my name although he declared the contents as gold and =
personal<BR>
effects for security reasons.<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, the whole family has mandated me to use the money for the<BR>
benefit of the entire family since I am the only one that is not under =
persecution.<BR>
<BR>
I would be grateful if you can assist in the remittance of this fund =
by<BR>
swift transfer into your account abroad for the benefit of my entire =
family<BR>
and for investment in your country. I have already taken refuge in =
Cotonou<BR>
to avoid persecution back home and also our accounts both foreign and =
local<BR>
have been frozen and property confiscated by the present Government in =
Sierra<BR>
Leone.<BR>
<BR>
In addition to the unlawful arrest going on in my country Sierra =
Leone,this<BR>
is an SOS message as I only rely on this money for =
survival,invariably.I<BR>
hope on your mercy, honesty and sincerity.<BR>
<BR>
I would be glad if you can assist as my father's foreign technical<BR>
partner in the security company in Europe and also assist me to invest =
this<BR>
fund in any viable investment in your country so that our family can =
be<BR>
able to start life again with this.<BR>
<BR>
Right now, I am hoping to further my education in your country<BR>
immediately after the successful transfer of this fund abroad with =
your<BR>
assistance.<BR>
<BR>
It was due to my father's problem that made me stop my doctoring =
degree<BR>
course at the University of Sierra Leone, kono (USK) in order to help =
my<BR>
family from total de-humanization.<BR>
<BR>
Every modality on how to invest this fund must be undertaken by you,<BR>
why because, I don't have any knowledge about business, moreover, I am =
too<BR>
young to handle such amount of money in any way.<BR>
<BR>
Now my questions are:-<BR>
<BR>
1. Can you handle this project?<BR>
<BR>
2. Can we give you this trust?<BR>
<BR>
3. What will be your commission?<BR>
<BR>
Consider this and get back to us immediately. Our family attorney will =
forward<BR>
to you all Informations on your response to this request urgently.<BR>
<BR>
Please note that this money is in cash and I am preparing to offer you =
a<BR>
negotiable commission for your assistance. Be rest assured that this =
is<BR>
100% risk free, The Sierra Leone government has no knowledge about =
this<BR>
money, including the country?s government Cotonou, Benin-Republic =
whereI<BR>
have taken refuge.<BR>
<BR>
Your urgent response would indicate your interest therefore I am =
seriously<BR>
looking forward in receiving your quick response soon. Remember I will =
not<BR>
fail to furnish you with all the information and documents relating to =
this<BR>
money when you indicate your interest to be of help to me.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks.<BR>
<BR>
Yours faithfully<BR>
<BR>
Miss Campbell Williams<BR>
For the family.<BR>
