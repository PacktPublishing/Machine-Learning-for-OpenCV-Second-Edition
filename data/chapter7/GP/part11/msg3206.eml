<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Dear Reader,<BR>
<BR>
All of our products are exact generic equivalants<BR>
of the well known brand name drugs, just like the<BR>
Ibuprofen you buy at the grocery store is the generic<BR>
version of Advil. Our generic pharmaceuticals are<BR>
made&nbsp; in a state-of-the-art laboratory using the exact<BR>
same top-grade ingredients as the name brands.<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
Being generic, our products are less expensive<BR>
than the brand name equivalants. The reason that you<BR>
can buy our products for less is that we dont pay for<BR>
branding, marketing, advertising, or a costly sales<BR>
force. We pass along those cost savings directly<BR>
to you.<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
We appreciate your business.<BR>
<BR>
Sincerely, Felipe<BR>
