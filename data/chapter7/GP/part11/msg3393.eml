You dont know me but my name is %TIF. My friend and I were at a party =
the other night and I saw you there.=20
I really wanted to meet you that night, I thought you looked like a =
really nice guy and that you were good looking too :-P
I had to leave the party so I asked my friend to get your email address =
for me and she did. I would like to meet you.=20
I hope to hear back from you :-)
