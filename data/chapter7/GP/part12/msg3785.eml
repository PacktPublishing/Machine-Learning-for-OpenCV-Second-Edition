<p>Read review by major news Network below</p>

  <p>&quot;Now the third product is that spray that is surprisingly =
effective,
  it puts a high gloss finish on your plate which causes a reflection =
that makes
  the plate overexposed so its practically impossible for police to spot =
plates
  that have been treated with the reflective spray and in many =
jurisdictions
  there's no specific rule that your tag must be photogenic.&quot;<br>

  <p>&quot;This is a high gloss spray that even the bakersfield police
  department admits they have a hard time proving whats on your =
plate.&quot;</p>

<p><em><strong>-CBS news</strong></em></p>
<p>&quot;the product works&quot;. &quot;state law makes outlawed plate =
covers,
but the statute doesn't specifically address sprays&quot;</p>
<p><em><strong>-NBC</strong></em></p>
<p>&quot;at the time being Australian, authorities are powerless to stop =
its
use, let alone catch those who are using it.&quot;</p>
