Major Breaking News: CDYV Expands Publication<BR>
into the Dallas/Ft.Worth, Texas Metroplex Area<BR>
Resulting in Circulation<BR>
of 3 Million Copies Monthly. Revenues to<BR>
Exceed 30 Mill Annually<BR>
with nearly 15 Mill Bottom-Line Profit.<BR>
<BR>
CDYV positioned as likely takeover candidate by the always<BR>
acquisition-minded leaders of the publishing industry<BR>
capturing sales of 20 Billion.<BR>
<BR>
CDYV is the leading advertising, printing, and publishing<BR>
Company in Texas specializing in the very high-profit<BR>
sector of community-based weekly publications. As Master<BR>
Publisher for the State of Texas, CDYV reaches 22 million<BR>
people, 254 counties, and over 3,100 towns and cities with<BR>
their &quot;Tidbits&quot; publication featuring local advertising<BR>
in dozens of areas including entertainment, retail, real<BR>
estate/housing, and consumer goods and services.<BR>
<BR>
CDYV has been in business 4 years and has grown quickly,<BR>
now it is time for them to explode in the public markets.<BR>
There are very few companies that have perfected this<BR>
niche of advertising platform with none being publicly<BR>
offered starting out at less than 50 cents per share.<BR>
<BR>
Monthly circulation has jumped from 500,000 to 3 million<BR>
with the additional expansion into Dallas/Ft.Worth,<BR>
translating into over 9 million readers monthly and<BR>
achieving an additional 17 million in annual revenues<BR>
from the Texas Metroplex. CDYV will also provide the<BR>
necessary printing services for 150 other national<BR>
publishers in their respective states resulting in<BR>
another 9.5 million in yearly sales, with 50% to the<BR>
bottom-line, on top of their already explosive,<BR>
record-breaking figures.<BR>
<BR>
The publishing industry has always been an active<BR>
leader in mergers, takeovers, and acquisitions. Dow<BR>
Jones (DJ, 39.00, PE 32), Gannett (GCI, 80.00, PE 16),<BR>
Knight-Ridder (KRI, 66.00, PE 16), and Tribune Co.<BR>
(TRB, 42.00, PE 24) are just a few examples of<BR>
industry leaders that have spent Billions over the<BR>
last few years acquiring aggressive and profitable<BR>
newspaper chains and publishing companies. CDYV<BR>
represents the epitome of an attractive buyout target<BR>
as their PE is 1 based on 12 - 18 month sales and<BR>
earnings figures. The industry average PE is 20,<BR>
indicating that a share price of 5.00 for CDYV would<BR>
be a very conservative valuation.<BR>
<BR>
It is only a matter of time before detailed<BR>
information is released out into the investment<BR>
community. By receiving this Email, you are among<BR>
the first public investors to know about CDYV. Get<BR>
in now before the crowds take it to the moon.<BR>
