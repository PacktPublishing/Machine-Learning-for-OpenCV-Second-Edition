 Dear Client,
 <p>Some time ago you filled out=20
   a form on the internet requesting help to re-fi=20
   your home. Since then we have not heard from you. If you
   have already re-fied or have not yet found what you<br>
   are looking for, you may want to take a look at our
   website,  start at 3.075%. Our form gives you
   the convenience of choosing which monthly payment is
 best for you depending on your circumstances.This<br>
   flexibility allows you to accelerate your loan in months
   where money is no problem. At other times you may choose
   another option such as interest only, and pay hudreds
   less. In any event, if you have a credit score of 520 or<br>
   more, our form will be right for you, and save you
 hundreds of dollars each and every month!</p>
 <p>Visit this site for more information: <a =
