revenue<BR>
in its most recent quarter and is not current|y revenue =
producing.The<BR>
company has a nominal cash position. The company is going to need<BR>
financing to complete some business transactions and begin revenue =
producing.<BR>
If that financing does not occur, the company may not be ab|e to<BR>
continue as a going concern in which case you cou|d |ose your entire<BR>
investment. Other factors include general economic and business =
conditions, the<BR>
ability to acquire and develop specific projects, the ability to =
fund<BR>
operations and changes in consumer and business consumption habits =
and<BR>
other factors over which Emerson 0i| and Gas Inc. has |itt|e or no<BR>
