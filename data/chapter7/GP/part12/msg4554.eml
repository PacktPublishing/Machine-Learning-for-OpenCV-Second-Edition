We don't know each other, but my name is bobbiejoe. I got your profile =
from  your e-mail address.=20
You sounded like a person that I wouldn't mind meeting, so I thought I =
would e-mail you.
I just love to meet new people, I am looking just to chat, and maybe we =
can have some fun too :).=20
I have a profile up and a videocam too :P I sometime like to have fun =
with my roommates on my videocam too :P
If you feel like chatting or just having fun you can get in contact me =
by going to my profile.
