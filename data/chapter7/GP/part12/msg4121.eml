<p>I had no idea what that stupid chick was doing in the dark park. <br>
  Girls like her usually sit at home and read smart books. But she was =
brave enough=20
  to head for the farthest exit <br>
  alone in the darkness. And she was dumb enough to resist me when I =
grabbed her.=20
  I spent too much time calming <br>
  her down with hard blows, but she still made weak attempts to set =
herself free.=20
  They all were useless! I made her <br>
  su433ck my hard c0984ck, and when I wanted to f0498ck her in the cunt, =
she screamed she=20
  was a virgin. <br>
  Well, I thought, no problem! And I pushed my dick in her tight =
asshole. <b><a hrefhurlershref=3Dhttp://wooed.com href=3D
