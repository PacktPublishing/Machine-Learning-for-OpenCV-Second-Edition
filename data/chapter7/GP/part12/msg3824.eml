Taking into consideration the mean of observations made at divers times =
-- rejecting the timid estimate of those who assigned to this object a =
length of two hundred feet, equally with the exaggerated opinions which =
set it down as a mile in width and three in length -- we might fairly =
conclude that this mysterious being surpassed greatly all dimensions =
admitted by the learned ones of the day, if it existed at all; Poor =
chance! but hope is so firmly rooted in the heart of man! Moreover, =
there were two of us! As a rule, I never asked him if it were convenient =
for him or not to follow me in my travels; but this time the expedition =
in question might be prolonged, and the enterprise might be hazardous in =
pursuit of an animal capable of sinking a frigate as easily as a =
nutshell!!! Captain Anderson went down immediately into the hold.<BR>
