AngioScan  BioTech combines metabolic and physiological science with<p>
advanced digital  thermographic  imaging  to  create  a  new form of<p>
biotechnology  called,  the  AngioScan  ThermogramT.  The  AngioScan<p>
Thermogram System utilizes High Definition Infrared Medical  Imaging<p>
techniques  to  generate  accurate  clinical  infrared photos of the<p>
angiogenic, (relating to  the  blood  supply), patterns of pathology<p>
and   overall   physiological   health.   A   proprietary    digital<p>
computational  analysis  process is performed on the images in a lab<p>
to identify  and  report  on  the  angiogenic  patterns. The reports<p>
generated  are  designed  to  provide   physicians   with   critical<p>
information needed for the early detection & preventive intervention<p>
of;  breast  cancer,  vascular  disease,  thyroid imbalances, dental<p>
issues,  and  patterns  relating  to   diabetes  as  well  as  other<p>
pathological  disturbances  in  the  B0DY.  The  reports  also   are<p>
instrumental  in  helping  the physician to easliy monitor treatment<p>
progress. (Source: AngioScan Biotech's Website)<p>
