<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Dear Sir/Madam,<BR>
<BR>
I am contacting you from Asia to discuss a business deal of US$18.4M<BR>
acquired during one of the rescue operation carried out by my =
organization<BR>
(an international relief organization) over the Tsunami =
rehabilitation<BR>
projects and programes.<BR>
<BR>
I will need your assistance as a nuetral person to the organization to =
claim<BR>
this excess fund.<BR>
<BR>
There is no risk involved in this project as measures are already in =
place<BR>
to secure the fund in a legitimate and acceptable process.<BR>
<BR>
If you will be interested to work with me, please contact me back on =
fax<BR>
number 852 301 60006 for details of the operation and negotiation for =
your<BR>
own share.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks, BS.<BR>
