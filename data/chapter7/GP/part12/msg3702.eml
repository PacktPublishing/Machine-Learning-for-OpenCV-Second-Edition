The Antidote is a unique Anti-Microbial Peptide offering the widest =
range of healing power on the market today. It kills all known deadly =
VIRUSES and BACTERIA in the body. The initial research was carried out =
over several years ago by the BBC.<BR>

The Antidote acts as an additive for your body's immune system. It will =
fight and protect your body from all virus and bacteria activated =
infections. The Antidote may be taken safely by children and adults even =
if on current medication.<BR>
<BR>

perfect method for maintaining a stable and healthy lifestyle.<BR>

The Antidote does not require a prescription or medical consultation =
before being taken as it is a natural alternative to Antibiotics or =
drugs which have failed to kill virulent viruses or bacteria that have =
developed an immunity to current antibiotics and drugs produced by =
modern medicine.<BR>
<BR>

It really is the all inclusive miracle that will kill<BR>
all viruses and bacteria your body can throw at it.<BR>
