How many times have you seen new issues explode but you couldn't get =
your hands on them? We are alerting you to a special company with a =
unique business model that is set to explode in next 1 month -- this is =
your chance to get in at the very beginning!<BR>
<BR>
This is also a chance to get in early, where usually only institutional =
investors get in, at the beginning. The average investor rarely gets the =
opportunity to get new issue shares at the beginning because brokers =
give them all to hedge funds and clients that do thousands of dollars of =
commission business with them, thereby leaving the small individual out =
in the COLD!<BR>
<BR>
This is exciting business in an exciting place and time. Don't be the =
one to look back and say, I had the chance to invest, but =
passed&#133;.<BR>
