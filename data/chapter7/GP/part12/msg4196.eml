The company released ground breaking news about its VOIP<BR>
division! Although some would argue that VoIP is still<BR>
maturing, corporate users are extremely interested in<BR>
implementing the technology, creating exponential growth.<BR>
Within the last four years, VoIP minutes increased from<BR>
less than 0.5 to 2 percent of outbound international calls,<BR>
according to research from TeleGeography. Additionally,<BR>
predictions as to the size of the market itself vary, with<BR>
Allied Business Intelligence projecting the VoIP market<BR>
to grow from $3.7 billion in 2000 to $12.3 billion in 2006<BR>
and Synergy Research projecting the VoIP equipment market<BR>
to grow to $13.3 billion by 2005.<BR>
