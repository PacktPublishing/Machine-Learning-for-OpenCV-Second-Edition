Three studies assessed staphylococcal endocarditis21 48 63 one study<BR>
assessed any staphylococcal infection32 and one assessed =
streptococcal<BR>
endocarditis 69&nbsp; lactamaminoglycoside treatment is well ingrained =
in<BR>
existing guidelines and clinical practice with these infections94 So =
what<BR>
have I done about it? Well its still a practicing effort, but I dont =
just<BR>
listen to what a man says. I look to see the connection in a mans =
actions.<BR>
Are they putting as much of an effort into the relationship? Do I feel =
that<BR>
they really feel what they say they are feeling? And to a fault, I =
am<BR>
skeptical at best that they truly mean what they say. Our best ally is =
our<BR>
gut feeling C and we are very guilty of ignoring it. When we ignore it =
we<BR>
are destined to get hurt.<BR>
