COMPANY PROFILE<BR>
--------------&gt;<BR>
American Resource Management, Inc., through its wholly-owned subsidiary, =
Efficiency Technologies, Inc. (&quot;EffTec&quot;) is a Tulsa, Oklahoma =
based company dedicated to developing energy efficiency monitoring =
programs for commercial/industrial HVAC systems principally made up of =
centrifugal chillers and boilers.&nbsp; Centrifugal chillers are the =
single largest energy-using components in most facilities and can =
typically consume more than 50% of the total electrical usage.&nbsp; =
Centrifugal chillers running inefficiently result in substantially =
higher energy costs, decreased equipment reliability and shortened =
lifespan.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
EffTec has developed a powerful, easy-to-use, online diagnostic service =
called EffHVAC that gives facilities the ability to document, monitor, =
evaluate and manage centrifugal chiller system performance.&nbsp; =
EffHVAC created detailed reports that contain a wealth of information =
that can be used to improve operations and save thousands of dollars in =
utility costs.<BR>

TULSA, Okla.,&nbsp; /PRNewswire-FirstCall via COMTEX/ -- American =
Resource Management, Inc. (OTC Pink Sheets: ARMM) through its =
wholly-owned subsidiary, Efficiency Technologies, Inc. (EffTec), =
announced today that EffHVAC is now available for subscription to the =
public. EffHVAC, which was developed by EffTec, is an easy to use online =
diagnostic service that allows property managers to document, monitor =
and evaluate centrifugal chiller performance on a daily and comparative =
basis to assist in promoting chiller efficiency.<BR>
<BR>
By way of example, a large chiller running at a 70% efficiency rating =
can increase an owner's operating cost by over $300,000 per year. By =
using EffHVAC diagnostic tools, a property manager will be provided with =
online reports that trends a chiller's performance and efficiency on a =
real-time basis to assist in decisions which will improve chiller =
performance.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;There are over 100,000 centrifugal chillers in the United States =
which could benefit from using EffHVAC. Chiller inefficiencies cost the =
industry over one billion dollars annually, and with all businesses =
constantly seeking ways to reduce costs, EffFHVAC will be able to help =
facilitate significant energy savings in chiller operations,&quot; =
stated Derrick Shoemake, President of EffTec.<BR>
