&lt;p&gt;ERHC and ExxonMobil exercise priority rights on highly sought =
after oil blocks<BR>
&nbsp; in &lt;br&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; Nigeria and Sao Tome's Joint Development Zone (JDZ) in the Gulf =
of Guinea.&lt;/p&gt;<BR>
&lt;p&gt;Every major newswire service worldwide has carried hundreds of =
articles revealing<BR>
&nbsp; that &lt;br&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; the offshore oil blocks in this region contain 10 to 15 Billion =
Barrels of Oil.<BR>
&nbsp; The JDZ &lt;br&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; line-up tipped to take over upcoming blocks includes ExxonMobil, =
ERHC, &lt;br&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; ChevronTexaco, AmeradaHess, and Anadarko.&lt;/p&gt;<BR>
&lt;p&gt;License approval for the region's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) =
is a multilateral<BR>
&nbsp; deal &lt;br&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; securing blocks jointly involving ExxonMobil, ERHC, and =
ChevronTexaco.&lt;/p&gt;<BR>
&lt;p&gt;ERHC has jumped from a .25 cent stock earlier in the year to a =
.50 cent stock<BR>
&nbsp; that is &lt;br&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; headed for over $2 or a possible buyout from one of their JDZ =
multinational<BR>
&nbsp; players.&lt;/p&gt;<BR>
&lt;p&gt;ERHC has been at the negotiating tables with the super-major =
oil companies.<BR>
&nbsp; It is &lt;br&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; impossible to measure the power that is carried where a stock at =
this price<BR>
&nbsp; level is a &lt;br&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; vital part of a key union of oil giants! The top-level executives =
of the JDZ<BR>
&nbsp; oil majors &lt;br&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; have been finalizing the percentage awards with ERHC for official =
announcement<BR>
&nbsp; of the &lt;br&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; landmark-licensing round in the first 2 weeks of =
June.&lt;/p&gt;<BR>
&lt;p&gt;The US Government is pushing for increasing development of the =
area to minimize<BR>
&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; Middle East dependence. The eyes of the world are watching with =
record prices<BR>
&nbsp; at the &lt;br&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; pump and oil busting through $40 per barrel.&lt;/p&gt;<BR>
&lt;p&gt;The oil companies will always make their $Billions - investors =
can cash in<BR>
&nbsp; by &lt;br&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; accumulating a substantial position just before earth-shattering =
news is released<BR>
&nbsp; that &lt;br&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; will send shockwaves through ERHC.&lt;/p&gt;<BR>
