Wall Street Money Report discovers leading edge Entertainment Company =
preparing for blockbuster new release! KDSC positioned as the #1 stock =
investment in children's entertainment for years to come.<p>

 Over the past decade, Disney and Warner Brothers have perfected a =
proven formula in the entertainment industry that consistently delivers =
over $100 Million per film release. Box office results have shown that =
animated features and movies geared toward a younger audience are =
genuine profit makers with movie-goers starved for quality G-rated =
family entertainment.<p>

 By enhancing this model for success, KidSational, Inc. (KDSC) is =
building a solid platform in the most profitable segment of all =
mainstream movies - typically 5X more profitable than a big production =
film. Through skillful management and product depth, KDSC is rapidly =
becoming a diversified entertainment empire, poised to become one of the =
leaders in this industry.<p>

 Fueled by recent positive developments and the revenue power of its =
product line, KidSational is on track during the month of August to =
finalize negotiations with leading Hollywood producers and executives to =
bring "The Guardians" movie to the Big Screen. KDSC is moving forward =
with lightning speed as evidenced by their developing relationships with =
specialists in entertainment law and top music tour management, motion =
picture producers, executive producers and distributors, and the =
selection of product placement and marketing experts.<p>

KDSC's initial motion picture is entitled "The Guardians - Masters of =
the Electro-World", based on adolescent super heroes along the lines of =
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, who have =
collectively produced revenues exceeding $500 Million. One clear =
advantage for KDSC is that "The Guardians" is scheduled to feature TV =
and movie industry stars, giving the film that extra boost of mass =
appeal. KDSC's theater release is based upon the theme and characters in =
the nationally available Guardian's board game (100% owned by KDSC) =
which is used in over 400 elementary schools and has been featured on a =
major nationally syndicated afternoon TV talk show.<p>

 Judging by the numbers, major full length films of this type that reach =
out not just to kids but entire families, have enjoyed huge box office =
success. This is based on a release of over 1,000 screens, right in line =
with Company expectations for their premier in just the US alone. But =
the box office revenues are only a fraction of the huge income that is =
typically realized from a film. To maximize profits, KDSC is also =
securing multiple streams of promotional revenue from food chains and a =
major shoe manufacturer, a completed licensing agreement with DLI in =
Georgia to manufacture apparel for a branded product line of children's =
wear, and a variety of products available at the retail level all based =
upon the film. Everything from action figures, clothing, toys, to =
children's party favors and lunch boxes are scheduled for national =
merchandising in order to extend the brand and generate revenue.<p>

 If this were the whole story, it would be more than enough to justify a =
strong buy recommendation for KDSC. However, this isn't even the tip of =
the iceberg. The really big income will most likely be in VCR/DVD sales =
after the movie has run in theaters. Anyone who has small children or =
grandchildren knows that the VCR/DVD is today's electronic baby sitter. =
Children watch films over and over again memorizing all the songs and =
story lines. It is very realistic by today's standards to see video and =
DVD sales hit the $100 Million mark, especially with the availability at =
retail super-stores and the Internet. One of the most magnificent facts =
about children's movies is that a new generation is born every 7 years =
to enjoy re-releases as well as home video.<p>

 KDSC's Music Division is red-hot, featuring the new urban/pop music =
sensation "TGK". This group of young superstars currently has a =
nationwide advance release of a new single from their CD in major music =
retail stores, which has already jumped into the top 20. KDSC is =
enjoying the ultimate in cross-over entertainment success by featuring =
the music of TGK in the soundtrack for The Guardians movie. TGK has been =
receiving major radio airplay while performing worldwide, and promotes =
only a positive message with no negative lyrics in their music.<p>

 KDSC has cemented partnerships that will enhance their entertainment =
products, increase distribution channels, and accelerate growth. Dynamic =
profits are realized in the early growth stages of a burgeoning =
entertainment company that has nailed the blueprint for success. Savvy =
investors with an eye for value can benefit from the tremendous profits =
that will launch the fortunes of this new film and entertainment =
powerhouse.<p>
