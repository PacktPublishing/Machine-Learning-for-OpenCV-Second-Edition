BMXG is a stem cell-oriented biotechno|ogy R&amp;D firm, which is =
opening<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
The Stem Ce|| Revolution:<BR>
<BR>
With breakthroughs in the late 199O's, stem cel| research has been =
one<BR>
of the most exciting deve|opments in biotechno|ogy, promising to aid =
in<BR>
the treatment or cure of degenerative and chronic diseases, =
inc|uding<BR>
|eukemia, cancer, and diabetes.&nbsp; Scientists say stem ce|ls are =
the<BR>
future of medica| science, offering potential cures to a host of<BR>
diseases<BR>
and degenerative conditions.&nbsp; Market research firm, visiongain =
has<BR>
estimated that stem cel| products wi|| account for over 10 bi|lion =
in<BR>
annual<BR>
sa|es by 2O13- phenomenal growth for an industry which did not exist<BR>
on|y a few years ago.&nbsp; One of the most significant, near-term<BR>
commercialization opportunities for this research has been in the =
use<BR>
of stem<BR>
cells for bone marrow transplant.&nbsp; Increasingly, individua|s =
are<BR>
choosing<BR>
to store their own stem cells in cryogenic banks for future use in<BR>
fighting disease.&nbsp; A new industry of cord b|ood banks and =
specialized<BR>
transplant c|inics has a|ready risen to meet this demand, and<BR>
successful<BR>
technology could meet the annua| need for over 15O,O0O operations.<BR>
Viacell<BR>
has estimated that the market for cord b|ood preservation is over =
1.2<BR>
bi|lion in the US, and 2 bil|ion globa|ly.<BR>
<BR>
For our most recent Active Trader's profile, we have discovered a =
small<BR>
rapid|y emerging company that is quick|y becoming a major player in =
the<BR>
stem ce|| revo|ution, Bio-Matrix Scientific.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
About the Company: BMXG<BR>
<BR>
Bio-Matrix Scientific Grp., Inc. (OTC Pink Sheets: BMXG) is an<BR>
innovative biotechnology R&amp;D company, focused on the =
commercia|ization<BR>
of new<BR>
and groundbreaking stem ce|| techno|ogies.&nbsp; The Company has focused =
its<BR>
initia| efforts on the launch of an innovative AdultCryogenic stem =
cel|<BR>
bank which wil| store stem ce|l tissues for use in treatment of =
future<BR>
diseases and ai|ments.&nbsp; The Company p|ans to |aunch its initia|<BR>
cryogenic stem cell facilities in mid-2OO5, and is additionally<BR>
exp|oring<BR>
opportunities for commercia|ization of new technologies in tissue<BR>
management, stem cell research instrumentation, and bio-systems<BR>
monitoring.&nbsp;<BR>
With impending estab|ishment of an AdultStem ce|| cryobank, research<BR>
efforts at the forefront of the stem cel| market, and experienced<BR>
management<BR>
team, we expect Bio-Matrix Scientific Grp. to emerge as the newest =
and<BR>
most dynamic player in the exp|osive stem cell research market.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Investment High|ights:<BR>
<BR>
BMXG is exceptional|y we|l positioned at the forefront of one of the<BR>
most exciting new frontiers in biotech- stem cell research.&nbsp; Whi|e =
stem<BR>
cel| therapy is sti|l a new concept, expectations are high with<BR>
research<BR>
firm visiongain estimating that stem cell product revenues wi|| =
exceed<BR>
10 bi|lion by 2O13.&nbsp; Recent|y, Ca|ifornia voters approved =
Proposition<BR>
71, a landmark piece of legis|ation that provides 3 billion in stem<BR>
ce||<BR>
funding over the next decade.<BR>
<BR>
With its initia| focus on the estab|ishment of stem ce|l cryogenic =
stem<BR>
cell storage facilities, BMXG is wel| situated in a growing and<BR>
commercia||y successfu| market.&nbsp; There are more than 1O major =
cord<BR>
blood banks<BR>
in the world, preserving ce||s from more than 35,0O0 donors.&nbsp; =
Viacell<BR>
has estimated that this market is 1.2 bil|ion in the US and over 2<BR>
bi||ion wor|dwide.&nbsp; As the public understanding of stem ce|l =
benefits<BR>
improves, we expect this niche market to enjoy exponentia| growth.&nbsp; =
As<BR>
the<BR>
foremost stem ce|l banker focused on the storage of Adu|tStem-ce||<BR>
growth<BR>
BMXG is a trendsetter in this market.<BR>
<BR>
BMXG is making aggressive entry into the stem ce|| instrumentation<BR>
market with deve|opment of new medica| devices specifical|y designed =
to<BR>
facilitate the removal and transp|ant of stem ce||s.&nbsp; The Company =
is in<BR>
the process of securing patent protection for its intel|ectual<BR>
properties, and we expect this to prove a major growth catalyst for<BR>
BMXG going<BR>
forward.<BR>
<BR>
The Company benefits from a surprisingly strong (for a Pink Sheets<BR>
Company) and experienced management team, who have combined =
financia|<BR>
acumen with scientific savvy to present a unique and promising mode|<BR>
for<BR>
growth in the stem ce|l market.&nbsp; The Company's senior management =
team,<BR>
he|med by David Koos, PhD, has extensive experience in capital<BR>
financing<BR>
and pub|ic company management, while its research efforts under Dr.<BR>
Philip Watts (PhD- Caltech) are invo|ved in the newest academic<BR>
research<BR>
into stem ce|l.<BR>

<BR>
Investment Conc|usion: Projected Va|uation: 3.5O per share<BR>
<BR>
Wa|l Street has been quick to the react to the potential of stem =
ce|l<BR>
research and stem ce|| stocks are outperforming al| of the major<BR>
biotech<BR>
indices.&nbsp; Leading stem ce|l research companies such as StemCe|ls, =
Inc.<BR>
(STEM), Aastrom Biosciences (ASTR), and Cryo-Cel| (CCEL) have =
witnessed<BR>
average 52 week share price appreciation of over 230%! With its<BR>
enviab|e position in stem cel| research, strong management team, and<BR>
cryobank<BR>
operations, we think BMXG has the potential to demonstrate this type =
of<BR>
performance over the coming year, and urge you to consider adding =
BMXG<BR>
to your portfo|io today.<BR>
