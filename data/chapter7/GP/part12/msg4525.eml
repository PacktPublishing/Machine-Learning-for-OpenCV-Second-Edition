Any man who is under 30; and is not a liberal; has not heart; and any =
man who is over 30; and is not a conservative; has no brains. - Sir =
Winston Churchill (1874-1965) <br><br> Whenever I climb I am followed by =
a dog called Ego. - Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900) <br><br> Once you =
eliminate the impossible whatever remains no matter how improbable must =
be the truth. - Sherlock Holmes (by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle 1859-1930)
