<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>IT'S TRUE!<BR>
You can go on a fabulous cruise where<BR>
all your meals and activities are included,<BR>
where your destination is the beautiful Nassau<BR>
Island in the Bahamas , a place that will take<BR>
your breath away. You'll stay 3 glorious days<BR>
in the sun in the Grand Bahama Island before<BR>
leaving on a romantic moonlit cruise back to Florida.<BR>
<BR>
You'll then have 4 fun days to spend in magical Orlando,<BR>
the home of Universal Studios, an enchanted place you'll<BR>
also recieve a 2, 2 day FREE pass's into. Plus<BR>
3 days and 2 nights in Ft Lauderdale Florida home of the worlds<BR>
most beutiful beaches&nbsp; WOW!<BR>
<BR>
OK WHAT'S THE CATCH?<BR>
Not a one...<BR>
Except space is limited and will be booked on<BR>
a first come first serve basis.The cruise lines and hotels do<BR>
not want any empty space. They would rather practically give the<BR>
rooms away in hopes that you'll spend time and money in the<BR>
casino<BR>
or some of the many gift shops.Even if you don't know a travel date<BR>
now, you can book any time in the next 18 months with 60 days<BR>
notice.<BR>
<BR>
They don't expect this drop in tourism to last forever so take<BR>
advantage<BR>
now while you can.At this price, you can take the kids or treat your<BR>
mom and dad or do a mother daughter thing or take a second<BR>
honeymoon.<BR>
With the actual vacation costs so low, you'll be able to do the =
things<BR>
you've always wanted to on vacation.To learn more about this<BR>
memory<BR>
making limited offer.<BR>
