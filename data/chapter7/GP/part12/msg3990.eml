<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Hi,<BR>
<BR>
My name is Nellie and I was asked by Carlson to talk to you about<BR>
the benefits of the product that I am using.<BR>
<BR>
I have been married for over 12 years now and lately, like all =
marriage's,<BR>
we have become more and more distant from each other.&nbsp; We have not =
been<BR>
intimate in over 6 months.&nbsp; Well about a month ago, I came across =
an email<BR>
that was selling these products that was guaranteed to help with our =
problem.<BR>
I was hesistant at first, but decided to go ahead and try it anyway.<BR>
To my surprise, it worked exactly as they said.<BR>
<BR>
It's not the miracle that will save a marriage but it will definatlely =
help<BR>
put the spark back into the relationship. I am trying to help as many =
people<BR>
as I can to find the happiness that once was. You should definately =
check it<BR>
out and tell me what you think.<BR>
<BR>

Just get back to me and tell me if I was able to help you with this.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks,<BR>
