Applicant said if he was hired he would demonstrate his loyalty by =
having the corporate logo tattooed on his forearm. All bombs are fitted =
with electronic timing devices with large red readouts. "I know this is =

Your first-aid kit contains two pints of coffee with an I.V. hookup. You =
channel surf faster without a remote.=20

enemies will wait patiently to attack you one by one. "What is it that =
you people do at this company?" All of which will give their captives at =

If you decide to start dancing in the street. People are always watching =
