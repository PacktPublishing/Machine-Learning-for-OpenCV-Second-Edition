<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Whats up....or down for the matter of fact :]. Anyways =
Hi, I am Julie. My birthday was not to long ago. I turned 18. I am a =
senior high school student. I love animals and cute bunnys, but most of =
all I love getting off on my new webcam :D. I am so excited, its free, =
its live stream and I am usually on only 5 days a week 24 hours a day. =
No silly memberships, verify your age and you can be watching me right =
now. Well, I do this for you, I am not a slut!... I just love getting =
off, and interweb gives me this ability to do what ever I want and as =
much as I want untill we are both pleased :D. See you soon hun. Luv =
Julz.<BR>
