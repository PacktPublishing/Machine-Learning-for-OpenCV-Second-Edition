On the rising tide like a bridge of boats.<BR>
And mark that Point where Sense and Dulness meet.<BR>
The solid Pow'r of Understanding fails;<BR>
These born to Judge, as well as those to Write.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Thus in the Soul while Memory prevails,<BR>
Be sure your self and your own Reach to know.<BR>
On the rising tide like a bridge of boats.<BR>
