Bertha was a very pretty girl. Quite a lot of young men wanted to =
marry<BR>
her, but she was not satisfied with any of&nbsp; them. One day, one of =
the young<BR>
men came to visit her and asked her to become his wife. She answered, =
&quot;No,<BR>
John,I won't marry you.I want to marry a man who is famous, who can =
play<BR>
music m sing and dance very well, who can tell interesting stories, who =
does<BR>
not smoke or drink , who stays at home in the evenings and who stops =
talking<BR>
when I'm tired of listening.&quot;The young man got up, took his coat =
and went to<BR>
the door, but before he left the house, he turned and said to Bertha, =
&quot;It<BR>
isn't a man you're looking for. It's a television set.&quot;<BR>
An explorer in the deepest Amazon suddenly found himself surrounded by =
a<BR>
bloodthirsty group of natives. Upon surveying the situation, he said =
quietly<BR>
to himself, &quot;Oh God, I'm screwed.&quot; A ray of light fell from =
the sky and a<BR>
voice boomed out, &quot;No, you are not screwed. Pick up that stone at =
your feet<BR>
and bash in the head of the chief standing in front of you.&quot; So the =
explorer<BR>
picked up the stone and proceeded to bash the life out of the chief. =
He<BR>
stood above the lifeless body, breathing heavily, surrounded by 100 =
natives<BR>
with looks of shock on their faces. The voice boomed out again, =
&quot;Okay, now<BR>
you're screwed.&quot;<BR>
