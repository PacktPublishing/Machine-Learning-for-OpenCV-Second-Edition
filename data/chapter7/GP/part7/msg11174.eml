In fact, it could be argued that one of the most serious emerging =
threats to=20
human rights today is Amnesty's decision to spend a disproportionate =
share of its limited resources attacking the United States--at the =
opportunity cost of focusing attention on governments that are =
slaughtering, enslaving, torturing, and imprisoning millions of people =
around the world.

Yes, you'd think they'd be focusing on places like the Sudan, where The =
Telegraph reports:  "Arab militia use 'rape camps' for ethnic =
cleansing."=20

In Darfur, Sudan's western-most region, the people remain untouched by =
last week's peace agreement signed between the country's Islamic =
government and Christian rebels.  Sudanese soldiers and the =
government-backed Janjaweed militia still terrorise, and at the centre =
of their campaign of "ethnic cleansing" is a policy of systematic rape =
designed to drive civilians from their settlements.

Yet Sudan, bizarrely enough, actually has a seat on the United Nations' =
Human Rights Commission.  Proof enough that "human rights" as a subject =
area requires some rethinking if it's going to be about, you know, =
actual human rights.

GOOD AND BAD FOR KERRY

John Kerry's campaign has revolved around obfuscation and straddles =
where the current war is concerned, coupled with constant mentions of =
his service in Vietnam.  He may be wondering if his strategists have =
gotten it backward.

In a speech in Seattle last week, Kerry was talking tough on terror:

"This country is united in its determination to destroy you," said Kerry =
of the terrorists, in the first of a series of foreign-policy speeches =
timed to coincide with Memorial Day and President Bush's trip to Europe =
for D-Day ceremonies.=20
"As commander in chief, I will bring the full force of our nation's =
power to bear on finding and crushing your networks. We will use every =
available resource to destroy you," Kerry said in Seattle.

Some observers suggested that Kerry's tougher tone was based on internal =
polls that indicated that many swing voters want to hear tough talk.  =
This may well be right.  I certainly applaud Kerry's statement, and I =
hope we'll hear more like this, not least because such statements, if =
they are believed, are likely to deter a Madrid-type terrorist attack =
designed to affect American elections.  If both candidates promise to be =
tough on terror, there's no point in the terrorists trying to get one or =
the other elected. =20

Unfortunately for Kerry, while he's doing better with the current war =
the Vietnam angle seems to be hurting him.  I've mentioned various other =
veterans' groups that have come out against his candidacy, but the =
Washington Post reports yet another; the Rolling Thunder motorcycle =
group, made up of Vietnam Vets, endorsed President Bush:

Rolling Thunder, which claims 82 chapters in the United States and =
abroad, has endorsed Bush over the presumptive Democratic nominee, Sen. =
John F. Kerry (Mass.), and the Bush campaign turned out to capitalize on =
that endorsement. Two members of Bush's Cabinet joined the Rolling =
Thunder parade: Secretary of Veterans Affairs Anthony J. Principi and =
Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy G. Thompson, who showed up =
for his sixth Rolling Thunder ride decked out in black jeans, a black =
vest and black sunglasses.=20
Although Bush never saw combat and Kerry is a highly decorated Vietnam =
veteran, many in the Rolling Thunder crowd demonstrated little affection =
for their brother-in-arms. As they rolled across the Memorial Bridge, =
around the Lincoln Memorial and down Constitution Avenue, bikers =
displayed signs reading "Stop Kerry" and "Vietnam Vets against Kerry." . =
. .
Bob Nowak, 52, a retired Navy man from Aroda, Va., who did two tours in =
Vietnam, said veterans such as himself despise Kerry for his decision to =
protest the war in the early 1970s.=20
Nowak remembers returning from Vietnam in 1973 aboard an aircraft =
carrier loaded with thousands of sailors in their dress whites. "As we =
passed under the Golden Gate Bridge, there were people waiting for us.  =
And they threw garbage on us," Nowak recalled. "That was about the time =
Kerry was throwing his [ribbons] away.  It's kind of hard to forget =
either of them
