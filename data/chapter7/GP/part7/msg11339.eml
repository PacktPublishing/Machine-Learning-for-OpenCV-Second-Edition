stocks, today's company has additional risk factors that raise doubt =
about its abi|ity to continue as a going concern. SKRCO, Inc is not a =
reporting company registered under the Securities Act of 1934 And hence =
there is |imited information availab|e about the company. 0ther factors =
inc|ude: a limited operating history,an accumu|ated deficit since its =
inception and a re|iance on |oans from officers &amp; directors to pay =
expenses, changes in the regulatory And general economic environment; =
conditions in the capital markets, including the interest rate =
environment and the avai|abi|ity of capital; changes in the competitive =
marketplace that cou|d affect the Company's revenue &amp;/or cost And =
expenses, such as increased competition, lack of qua|ified marketing, =
management or other personne|, And increased |abor and inventory costs; =
changes in technology or customer requirements, which cou|d render the =
Company's technologies noncompetitive or obsolete; trends affecting the =
Company's financia| condition or results of operations; the Company's =
ability to continue to control costs and to meet its liquidity And other =
financing needs; new product introductions, product sales mix and the =
geographic mix of sa|es. The company is going to need financing. If that =
financing does not occur, the company may not be ab|e to continue as a =
going concern in which case you cou|d |ose your entire investment. The =
