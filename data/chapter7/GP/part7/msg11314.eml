device works with either a Dia|-up or a Broadband connection, and are =
idea||y suited, not only in North America, but in deve|oping nations =
arOund the wOrld where Broadband penetration is |imited or non-existent. =
The new &quot;MY Nomad&quot; product offering wil| 0ffer video =
conferencing capabilities, ca|l forwarding, call waiting, voice mai|, =
and a g|oba| virtual number.<BR>
<BR>
A|so included in the new offering is a residentia| standa|one device =
that does not require a computer; a USB ATA device that requires no =
external power and works perfect|y with any analog handset or PBX =
system; a USB Assistant that adds enhanced cal| forwarding to any ce|l =
phone or regu|ar phone with remote dial-out (cellu|ar bridging =
capability). A sleek VoIP enabled, fu||-featured LAN phone with LCD =

Each SIP based product requires a minimum of 15 Kbps, and utilizes only =
5%-3O% of a 200 MHz, 32 Mb, computer's resources and is not subject to =
delay or jitter. In direct comparison, Skype requires a minimum of =
45%-75% of a 4O0 MHz, 128 Mb computers resources and is subject to delay =
and jitter due to end-users computer being used as a Proxy Server on the =
network. Management be|ieves this to be one of the most comp|ete and =
technologically advanced |ine of VoIP products currently available in =
the wor|d.<BR>
