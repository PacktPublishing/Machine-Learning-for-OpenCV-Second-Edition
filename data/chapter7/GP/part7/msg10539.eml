Dear Friend,<BR>
&nbsp;I apologize if this mail message does not suit your personal =
or<BR>

My names are Bochem Voosen an attorney to Mr Morris Thomspson, who =
was<BR>
an American by nationality , Also referred to as my client.This =
letter<BR>
may come to you as a surprise since it is coming from someone you =
have<BR>
not met before and due to high volume of Spam mail that goes around =
the<BR>
world through this means but I have no other choice than to send it =
to<BR>
you through the internet means, Therefore,<BR>
I will appreciate it if you honor it and give me all your trust and<BR>
full co-operation.<BR>
I came to know about you in my private search for a reliable<BR>
person or company to handle this confidential transaction on behalf =
of<BR>
my Chamber and myself through this contact WEBSIT(<A =
HREF=3D"http://www.hi5.com">http://www.hi5.com</A>).<BR>
On the 31th of January 2000, my client by name Mr Morris Thomspson, =
and<BR>
his wife Thelma Thomspson and daughter Sheryl Thomspson&nbsp; died in =
the<BR>
Alaska Airlines Flight 261 plane crash, you can confirm it yourself =
via<BR>

w.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/</A><BR>
Since then, I have been managing his properties here<BR>
in Belgium and some of his properties, which he put out for sale. =
Which<BR>
I monitored the payment as his attorney, has been bought and paid =
for.<BR>
Now the money paid was deposited into his foreign account in canada. =
I<BR>
have contacted you to assist in transfering the money to your =
account<BR>
before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by his bank.<BR>
Particularly, the bank has issued me a notice to provide any of his<BR>
next of kin or have the account confiscated within a short<BR>
time. My late client has an account valued at 15.5 million dollars.<BR>
Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for some =
time<BR>
now, and with the bank giving me deadline, I now seek your consent =
to<BR>
present you as the next of kin of the deceased, so that the proceeds =
of<BR>
this account valued at 15.5 million dollars can be paid to you and =
then<BR>
you, and I can share the money. 50% to me amounting to =
US$7,750,000.00<BR>
dollars and 40% for you amounting to US$6,200.000.00 and 10% =
amounting<BR>
to<BR>
<BR>
US$1,550,000.00<BR>
for miscellaneous expenses that might arise. I have all necessary<BR>
information that can be used to back up any Claim we may make.<BR>
All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us<BR>
see this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under<BR>
a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of<BR>
the law. Trust me, as his attorney; this is a risk-free =
relationship.<BR>
Send me your full names and address, telephone and fax<BR>
numbers to enable us discuss further about this transaction.<BR>
A swift acknowledgement on the receipt of this mail<BR>
would be appreciated.<BR>
I Remain obliged,<BR>
