<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Hello,<BR>
&nbsp;I am Mike Rod and I represent Mr. Mikhail Khordokovsky the =
former<BR>
&nbsp;C.E.O of Yukos Oil Company in Russia. I have a very sensitive =
and<BR>
&nbsp;confidential brief from this top (oligarch) to ask for your<BR>
partnership<BR>
&nbsp;in re-profiling funds and acting as a proxy to this funds over =
US$50<BR>
&nbsp;million. This is a legitimate transaction. You will be paid 4% =
for<BR>
&nbsp;your &quot;management fees&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
If you are interested, please write back by email ,if there is a<BR>
&nbsp;phone&nbsp; number where you can be reached and the best time to =
reach<BR>
you,that<BR>
&nbsp;will be fine too I will provide further details and<BR>
instructions.Please<BR>
&nbsp;keep this confidential; we can't afford more political<BR>
&nbsp;problems.Finally, please note that this must be concluded within =
two<BR>
&nbsp;weeks also Note that your percentage is subject to negotiation. I =
look<BR>
&nbsp;forward to hear from you.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
