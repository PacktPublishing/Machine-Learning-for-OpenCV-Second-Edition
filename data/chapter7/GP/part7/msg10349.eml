<BR>
Geoffrey ---- 47, Male, UK<BR>
What you claim is wrong. My sperm volume didn't<BR>
increase by 500%. It increased by ZILLION %<BR>
<BR>
Ken --- 38, Male, Canada<BR>
I fear it will become so thick my girl could get<BR>
hurt. =3D3D)<BR>
<BR>
Sharon --- Female, UK<BR>
My husband decided to try SPUR-M, and the results<BR>
are great! I just love it when it starts spurting out<BR>
<BR>
Jose --- 29, Male, USA<BR>
I cannot believe how good my semen has become. It is<BR>
a thick blob that shoots like a rocket. My wife says<BR>
she can feel the force with which my semen hits her<BR>
inside, which earlier she couldn't even feel. I don't<BR>
know about other customers but I am lovin it.<BR>
<BR>
Michael --- 41, Male, Hong Kong<BR>
I always dreamt of shooting like a porn star and I<BR>
can do it now, my girl cannot eat as much as I can shoot.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;My wife and I had been looking for a product to help<BR>
with boosting male fertility. I am happy to say that<BR>
test results have improved in the time I have been<BR>
using Spur-M (2 months). Thank you for your assistance,<BR>
and for the supply of Spur-M&quot;<BR>
