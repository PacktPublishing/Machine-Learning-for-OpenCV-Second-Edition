It has power to accumulate and exercise electrical repellent force
Perhaps you do not know what that means, so I will explain more fully
<br>
<br>When any missile, such as a bullet, sword or lance, approaches your
person, its rush through the air will arouse the repellent force of =
which I
speak, and this force, being more powerful than the projective force, =
will
arrest the flight of the missile and throw it back againTherefore =
nothing
can touch your person that comes with any degree of force or swiftness, =
and
you will be safe from all ordinary weapons
