<DIV>FROM THE DESK OF DR.CHEUNG POONG<BR>AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING =
MANAGER,<BR>CITI BANK OF HONG KONG (C.B..HK)<BR>KOWLOON-HONG KONG. =
</DIV>
<DIV>Good day in the name of God almighty! </DIV>
<DIV>I am the manager of Auditing and Accounting department of CITI =
BANK<BR>OF HONG KONG (C.B.HK) here in Kowloon-Hong Kong. In my =
department, we <BR>discovered an abandoned sum of US$20.5M dollar(TWENTY =
MILION FIVE <BR>HUNDRED <BR>THOUSAND US DOLLARS) in an account that =
belonged to one of our foreign <BR>customers(Mr.Klaus Schneider of =
Munich, Germany) who died along with <BR>his <BR>entire family in July =
2000 in a plane crash. </DIV>
<DIV>For more information about the crash visit this <BR>site:(<A =
href=3D"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm">http://news.b=
bc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm</A>). </DIV>
<DIV>Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting =
his <BR>next of <BR>kin to come over and claim his money because we can =
not release it <BR>unless <BR>somebody applies as a next of kin or =
relation to the deceased as <BR>indicated <BR>in our banking guidelines =
and laws, but unfortunately i learnt that all <BR>his <BR>supposed next =
of kin or relations died alongside with him&nbsp; at the&nbsp; <BR>plane =
<BR>crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. </DIV>
<DIV>It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this =
<BR>business <BR>proposal to&nbsp; you and release the money to you as =
the next of kin or <BR>relation <BR>to the deceased&nbsp; for safety and =
subsequent disbursement since nobody is <BR>coming for it and&nbsp; =
we&nbsp; don't&nbsp; want this money to go into the bank's <BR>treasury =
<BR>as<BR>unclaimed bill. </DIV>
<DIV>The&nbsp; banking law and guideline here stipulates that if =
such&nbsp; money <BR>remained&nbsp; <BR>unclaimed after fours years, the =
money will be&nbsp; transfered<BR>into the bank's&nbsp; treasury as =
unclaimed funds. </DIV>
<DIV>The request of a foreigner as next of kin in this business is =
<BR>occassioned by <BR>the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a =
Hong Kong citizen can <BR>not&nbsp; <BR>stand as next of kin to a =
foreigner. </DIV>
<DIV>I agree that 30% of this money&nbsp; will be&nbsp; for you as a =
respect to the <BR>provision of a foriegn account by&nbsp; you,&nbsp; =
and&nbsp;&nbsp; 70%&nbsp; would be for me.<BR>Thereafter, I will visit =
your country for&nbsp; disbursement&nbsp; according to <BR>the =
<BR>percentage indicated. </DIV>
<DIV>To apply to the bank as a&nbsp; relation or next of kin of the =
deceased,<BR>i shall send an application form to you when I hear from =
you, hence I <BR>will <BR>want you to&nbsp; send&nbsp; to me your =
private telephone and fax numbers for <BR>easy and <BR>effective =
communication and location wherein the money will be&nbsp; <BR>remitted. =
</DIV>
<DIV>Forward also,a copy of your international passport,occupation and =
full <BR>address. </DIV>
<DIV>Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the =
text <BR>of <BR>the application form . </DIV>
<DIV>Note that this transaction is hitch-free as all required =
arrangements <BR>have <BR>been made for the transfer.Just keep this =
information<BR>strictly confidential so that we do not lose the security =
of this <BR>project. </DIV>
<DIV>You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this =
letter. <BR>Trusting to hear from you immediately. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Yours Faithfully, </DIV>
