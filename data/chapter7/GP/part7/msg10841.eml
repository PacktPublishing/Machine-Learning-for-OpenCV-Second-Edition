2) Market Background<br>
Hepa<!dustiest>titis C <!bomber>Virus (HCV) is a s<!businesslike>mall, =
env<!inputs>eloped, s<!brownish>ingle-str<!illicitly>anded R<!funding>NA =
vir<!hoot>us <br>
in the fa<!Kiewit>mily Flavivir<!keepers>idae. HCV is a majo<!Cree>r =
cause o<!dinners>f liver dis<!Burch>ease in <!destuff>the United =
S<!disrespectful>tates <br>
and the <!bridles>world. H<!discs>CV accou<!Irene>nts for about =
1<!deplore>5 perce<!impervious>nt of acute hepa<!dump>titis =
cas<!complementing>es, 60 to 70 per<!Concordia>cent <br>
of ch<!Hyde>ronic hep<!flower>atitis case<!killings>s, and up =
t<!betroth>o 50 per<!collecting>cent of case<!differed>s of =
cirrh<!bitternut>osis, <br>
end-stage li<!fluency>ver disease, and li<!cotton>ver cancer. =
Th<!exhibition>ere about 1.3<!implies>-2.5% of the =
wo<!gerbil>rldw<!blissfully>ide populat<!bookies>ion <br>
is inf<!depleting>ected with <!idea>the virus. A<!ensuing>lmost 4 =
mil<!duskiness>lion American<!clutter>s, or 1.8 per<!counsellors>cent of =
the U.S. popu<!Leroy>lation, <br>
have antibo<!deuce>dies to H<!Cominform>CV indicat<!gropes>ing ongoing =
or<!Kessler> previous infec<!doubloon>tion with the v<!homing>irus. <br>
In the United States, there are 150,000 newly infected cases. <br>
Approx<!forums>imately 10,<!feminist>000 to 12<!detectives>,000 =
dea<!Hudson>ths <!grosses>each year in the U<!coon>nited =
Sta<!freshly>tes are due to HC<!grill>V.<br>
<br>
3) Chi<!diversities>na has a popula<!Englishize>tion of 1.3 billion, of =
whi<!consisted>ch 40 mi<!Dunn>llion are infected with <!Joes>HCV. <br>
Draw<!grieving>ing analogy to the current HB<!Cicero>V vaccination =
prog<!biped>ram, the number of people nee<!infected>ding <br>
to be vaccinated should be 20-25% of the total population (several =
hundred million people). <br>
It is also pos<!dune>sible the g<!beseeches>overnment will =
man<!Hicks>date immunization of<!bounden> high-risk popula<!belted>tions =
such <br>
as drug<!dozing> users, he<!cobbler>alth care wo<!India>rkers, =
immno-deficient pati<!Ehrlich>ents, and so on. <br>
<br>
4) HCV virus and ant<!hungrily>igen are needed b<!does>y all research =
and d<!connoting>evelopment institu<!hither>tions <br>
that wo<!dystrophy>rk with HCV, and the main market is =
co<!impotence>mprised of major universit<!Benedict>ies, <br>
medi<!crusts>um-sized bi<!Hillcrest>otech and larger =
phar<!introducing>maceutical companies, ar<!irreflexive>e close to 300 =
institutio<!Justine>ns. <br>
According to <!diploma>the market proj<!evolutions>ection of =
DA<!briefed>IYING, the an<!irking>nual demand for HCV part<!Finley>icles =
<br>
would ex<!discontinuities>ceed 150 million mi<!highlighted>lliliters. =
With reference to th<!copy>at the vaccine virus sam<!Leibniz>ples <br>
from ATCC cost about $2<!Kyoto>50.00 per mil<!brusquely>liliter with a =
$7<!Achilles>5.00 royal<!highlights>ty fee. <br>
Ass<!Hurons>uming a 25<!console>0ml single usage size, DAIYING expects =
to reach a gr<!busboys>oss sale <br>
of 300 million dollars ea<!dildo>ch year (based on $200/ml).<br>
<br>
