and want for nothing.&nbsp; No hurry for a signal at all.&nbsp; Well, =
Miss Elliot,&quot;<BR>
There, now, the truth is out. And I will own, that when people saw =
my<BR>
father perched up in front of the omnibus of death, dressed in his =
long,<BR>
wide, black cloak, and his black-edged, three-cornered hat on his head, =
and<BR>
then glanced at his round, jocund face, round as the sun, they could =
not<BR>
think much of sorrow or the grave. That face said, &quot;It is nothing, =
it will<BR>
all end better than people think.&quot; So I have inherited from him, =
not only my<BR>
good temper, but a habit of going often to the churchyard, which is =
good,<BR>
when done in a proper humor; and then also I take in the Intelligencer, =
just<BR>
as he used to do. I had known you by character, however, long =
before.&quot;<BR>
