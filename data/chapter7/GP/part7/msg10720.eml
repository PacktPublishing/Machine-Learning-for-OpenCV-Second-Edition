Vinoble, Inc. (VNBL.OB) is a holding company, which is identifying =
and<BR>
acquiring operational business opportunities in the areas of =
homeland<BR>
security, security information systems, and other security services =
to<BR>
provide long term growth for its shareholders.<BR>
<BR>
Vinoble believes that the opportunity to build a successful business =
in<BR>
the security sector is unprecedented.<BR>
<BR>
The terror attacks on the United States on September 11, 2O01 have<BR>
changed the security landscape for the foreseeable future. Both<BR>
physical<BR>
and logical security have become paramount for all industry =
segments,<BR>
especially in the banking, healthcare and government sectors. While =
the<BR>
focus for Vinoble is on North America, the opportunity for security<BR>
services is worldwide. According to Giga, a wholly owned subsidiary =
of<BR>
Forrester Research, worldwide demand for information security =
products<BR>
and<BR>
services is set to eclipse $46B by 2005.<BR>
<BR>
Vinoble intends to capitalize on the dramatic growth in the security<BR>
market by delivering professional services, security products, =
security<BR>
training, and managed security services. In pursuit of this =
objective,<BR>
Vinoble has assembled a highly qualified team of security =
professionals<BR>
offering a full range of security services. Through Vinoble's<BR>
consulting services and integrated delivery solutions, Vinoble will<BR>
help<BR>
organizations protect key assets including persons, property,<BR>
information,<BR>
brand, and reputation.<BR>
<BR>
Homeland Security, the National Strategy for a Secure Cyberspace, =
the<BR>
Healthcare Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA),<BR>
Sarbanes-Oxley and other regulatory programs will all cause a =
continued<BR>
increase in security demands in the United States and abroad. =
Vinoble<BR>
intends<BR>
to position itself as the 'most desired' provider of, both, physical<BR>
and information security solutions - in the eyes of our clients,<BR>
alliance<BR>
partners, and peers. We will accomplish this by ensuring our teams =
are<BR>
the most knowledgeable, agile, professional, and cost-conscious<BR>
provider of 'tailored' security solutions to meet the unique needs =
of<BR>
each<BR>
client.<BR>
<BR>
Management has partnered with GarcyCo Capital Corp. (&quot;GCCC&quot;) =
to assist<BR>
in finding acquisition candidates for the company, structuring such<BR>
acquisitions, and effecting a transition to corporate growth. At<BR>
present,<BR>
Vinoble and GCCC have targeted several companies as potential<BR>
acquisition candidates. Pending the outcome of due diligence and<BR>
audits, the<BR>
company believes the acquisition of these assets will provide the =
basis<BR>
required for listing on a national exchange.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
HERE IS RECENT NEWS ON THE COMPANY:<BR>
<BR>
MALIBU, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 20, 2OO5--Vinoble, Inc. (OTCBB:<BR>
VNBL - News), a holding company seeking to identify long-term growth<BR>
opportunities in the areas of homeland security, security =
information<BR>
systems, and other security services, is pleased to announce that as =
it<BR>
continues in its efforts to reach definitive agreements on the =
acquisition<BR>
of assets, businesses, and strategic partners in the RFID and GPS<BR>
tracking sector, Vinoble has further engaged with several additional<BR>
businesses and individuals for the purpose of acquiring technology, =
software,<BR>
and patents.<BR>
<BR>
Following the move to acquire RFID (Radio Frequency Identification)<BR>
technology, hardware and patents for the sole purpose of specific =
use<BR>
applications, the Company has concluded that the need for =
application<BR>
support software or middleware is part of the fundamental component of =
the<BR>
framework which operates such technology. The Company has identified<BR>
several sources for both licensing and the acquisition of such =
software,<BR>
and has begun to pursue discussions to access this important =
element.<BR>
<BR>
Middleware is used primarily to link disparate applications, both<BR>
internally and externally, to the enterprise. This typically =
involves<BR>
routing data using different transport protocols, translating data =
into<BR>
different formats and providing a suitable means of integration such as =
Web<BR>
services and service-oriented architectures.<BR>
<BR>
Since RFID is an integral part in the tracking of both mobile and<BR>
non-mobile assets, user-friendly and efficient management software =
enabling<BR>
customers to manage RFID data both incoming and out-bound is =
important<BR>
in maintaining customer loyalty and reduces costs associated with<BR>
customer service. Management software will allow for real time =
visibility of<BR>
assets or product inventory, whether in transit, in a warehouse, at =
the<BR>
manufacturing plant, or on a store shelf. Visibility and accuracy =
will<BR>
enable customers to reduce handling costs, gain instant access to<BR>
shipment information and increase inventory flow throughout the =
supply<BR>
chain. The ability to manage data collection from a number of different =
RFID<BR>
and GPS devices is essential for proper efficiency of the system.<BR>
<BR>
The Company believes that such acquisition of middleware technology<BR>
will be essential and will further position Vinoble in the vastly =
growing<BR>
RFID and GPS tracking industry. The Company's goal is to provide<BR>
critical security services at a cost manageable to even the smallest =
of<BR>
businesses that can't afford to do without the safety of their personnel =
and<BR>
assets in this current state of constant threat.<BR>
<BR>

expectations, beliefs, plans, projections, objectives, goals,<BR>
assumptions or future<BR>
events or performance are not statements of historical fact and may =
be<BR>
&quot;F0RWARD looking statements.&quot;FORWARD looking statements are =

anticipated. FORWARD looking statements in this action may be<BR>
identified<BR>

stockholder, supplies ninety-seven percent of the company's raw<BR>
materials:&nbsp;<BR>
reliance on two customers for over fifty percent of their business =
and<BR>
numerous related party transactions and the need to raise capital.<BR>

factors and others are more fully spelled out in the company's SEC<BR>
filings. We urge you to read the filings before you invest.&nbsp; The =
