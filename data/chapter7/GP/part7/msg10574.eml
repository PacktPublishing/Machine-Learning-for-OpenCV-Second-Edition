LONDON (Reuters) -- March 31, 20O5 -- Oil markets have entered a<BR>
``super-spike'' period that could see 1970's-style price surges as high =
as<BR>
$105 a barrel, investment bank Goldman Sachs said in a research =
report.<BR>
<BR>
Goldman's Global Investment Research note also raised the bank's =
20O5<BR>
and 2006 New York Mercantile Exchange crude price forecasts to $5O =
and<BR>
$55 respectively, from $41 and $4O.<BR>
<BR>
These forecasts sit at the top of a table of predictions from 25<BR>
analysts, consultants and government bodies surveyed by Reuters.<BR>
<BR>
``We believe oil markets may have entered the early stages of what =
we<BR>
have referred to as a ``super spike'' period -- a multi-year trading<BR>
band of oil prices high enough to meaningfully reduce energy =
consumption<BR>
and recreate a spare capacity cushion only after which will lower =
energy<BR>
prices return,'' Goldman's analysts wrote.<BR>

BNP Petroleum Corporation, Inc. is an Irving based oil and gas<BR>
exploration and development (E&amp;D) company. BNP Petroleum =
Corporation, Inc. was<BR>
formed for the purpose of development and operation of oil and gas<BR>
properties with proven reserves. The Company's strategy is to focus =
in<BR>
domestic areas where major oil and gas producing companies have =
reduced<BR>
their exploration efforts to move offshore and overseas in search of =
the<BR>
larger reserves. Considerable oil and gas in proven fields remain to =
be<BR>
exploited by well-managed independent oil companies capable of<BR>
extracting these reserves at lower risk and lower cost than unproved =
prospects.<BR>
BNP Petroleum's initial development strategy has been to acquire =
such<BR>
proven fields and increase production through the application of<BR>
advanced technology and the exploration of other proven formations in =
the same<BR>
fields.&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
BNP Petroleum Corporation's primary operational strategy includes =
the<BR>
operation of its own projects, giving it substantial control over<BR>
drilling and production costs. The Company has associated with =
highly<BR>
experienced exploration and development engineering and geology =
personnel that<BR>
strive to add production at lower costs through development =
drilling,<BR>
workovers, behind pipe recompletions and secondary recovery =
operations.<BR>
<BR>
The Company's long-term strategy is to build an oil and gas =
production<BR>
company through a strategic combination of selected property<BR>
acquisitions and an exploration program. Additionally, the Company will =
continue<BR>
to rework existing wells in an attempt to increase production and<BR>
reserves.<BR>

IRVING, Texas, May 25, 20O5 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- BNP Petroleum<BR>
Corporation (OTC Pink Sheets: BPET - News; BPET), an independent oil =
and<BR>
gas company, announced today restarting of &quot;Hooks&quot; lease =
located in<BR>
Wichita county Texas, after accomplishing modifications and upgrades =
on<BR>
some wells, in the last few months. The shallow wells previously had =
been<BR>
producing oil and water at low rates due to low bottom pressure, =
which<BR>
is normal for the area. Steadily increasing rates of production for<BR>
Hooks lease are expected.<BR>
<BR>
BNP Director, Rafael Pinedo said today, &quot;BNP Petroleum will =
begin<BR>
immediately to restart other leases in our portfolio of properties =
and<BR>
complete all necessary work to assure that BNP's properties are in =
full<BR>
compliance with the regulations of the Texas Railroad Commission and =
re-<BR>
establish oil production on BNP's leases over the coming =
months.&quot;<BR>

As with many micro-cap stocks, today's company has additional risk<BR>
factors worth noting. Those factors include: a limited operating<BR>

an<BR>
unsecured basis: one vendor, a related party through a majority<BR>
stockholder, supplies ninety-seven percent of the company's raw<BR>
materials:&nbsp;<BR>
reliance on two customers for over fifty percent of their business =
and<BR>
numerous related party transactions and the need to raise capital.<BR>
These<BR>
factors and others are more fully spelled out in the company's SEC<BR>
filings. We urge you to read the filings before you invest.&nbsp; The =
