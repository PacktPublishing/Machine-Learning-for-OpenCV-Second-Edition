May 25, 20O5V Nomad International Inc. (NDIN) announced today it has<BR>
entered into a letter of intent to provide an exclusive license to =
its<BR>
VoIP products with LMB Technologies Inc. for the Caribbean market =
which<BR>
includes Bermuda.<BR>
<BR>
The terms of the letter of intent include a 20% royalty payable to<BR>
Nomad of the gross revenue generated by LMB Technologies Inc. of any =
sales<BR>
and other revenue generated from the license. Additional =
consideration<BR>
payable to Nomad includes 2O% of the common stock of LMB =
Technologies<BR>
Inc. which will seek a public listing of its common shares in the =
U.S<BR>
market as soon as practicably possible.<BR>
<BR>
The acquisition of the license is subject to the parties entering =
into<BR>
a definitive agreement and to both the due diligence and board<BR>
approvals of LMB Technologies Inc. and Nomad International Inc.<BR>
<BR>
Pursuant to the proposed acquisition, on closing, LMB Technologies =
Inc.<BR>
would pay 2O% of its common stock to Nomad International Inc. as<BR>
consideration payable for the license and would agree to pay 20% of the =
gross<BR>
revenues generated from any activities related to the license =
exclusive<BR>
to the Caribbean market.<BR>
<BR>
The Caribbean market is one in which our technology has the<BR>
Opp0rtunity to potentially gain market share through our ability to =
provide VoIP<BR>
services over dial up networks. We are please with the distribution<BR>
relationships of LMB Technologies Inc. and hope to see our products in =
the<BR>
Caribbean market commercially in the short term., stated Jan =
Olivier,<BR>
CEO and Chairman of Nomad International Inc.<BR>
<BR>
May 18- Nomad International Inc. (NDIN) commented today on the =
recent<BR>
announcement by the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications<BR>
Commission (CRTC) that they would regulate Voice Over Internet =
Protocol<BR>
(VoIP) service only when it is provided and used as local telephone<BR>
service.<BR>
<BR>
In its decision, the CRTC determined that in an effort to build<BR>
sustainable competition in local telephone markets, the incumbent =
carriers<BR>
will not be permitted to price their local VoIP services below cost =
to<BR>
stifle competition.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The ruling is a very positive one for Nomad in our efforts to =
enter<BR>
the Canadian market with our products via Internet Service =
Providers,<BR>
cable companies and virtual operators. The ruling permits us to enter =
the<BR>
market with a competitive framework,&quot; stated Jan Oliver, CEO of =
Nomad<BR>
International Inc.<BR>
<BR>
The key to Nomad's entry into the VoIP market is the ability of its<BR>
products to 0ffer services to both broadband and dial-up customers. =
Though<BR>
broadband is gaining more and more acceptance and utilization<BR>
worldwide, dial-up remains the primary source of internet connectivity. =
In the<BR>
U.S. alone, there are over 2OO,OOO,O0O users of the internet. Of the<BR>
total users in the U.S., the total number of users of broadband is =
only<BR>
approximately 4O,0O0,O0O; (stats by the Yankee GrOup) dial-up =
therefore<BR>
represents approximately 8O% of the entire internet connectivity =
market.<BR>
The percentage of dial-up versus broadband users worldwide is even<BR>
higher.<BR>
<BR>
Nomad's ability to 0ffer VoIP products to dial-up customers and =
service<BR>
providers not only offers significant potential for market =
penetration,<BR>
but also sets the Company apart from its competition in the =
marketplace<BR>
by offering a unique, proprietary and easily adaptable product.<BR>
<BR>
