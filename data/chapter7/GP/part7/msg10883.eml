Unclaimed Fund (Late Engr. Douglas Briggs Estate)<BR>
<BR>
I am sending you this private email to make a passionate appeal to you =
for assistance. Kindly accept my apology for contacting you this way and =
forgive me if this is not acceptable to you. My name is Henry Ossai; I =
am an auditor at one of the Nigerian Banks in Lagos-Nigeria.<BR>
<BR>
During our last audit exercise, some amount of money totaling =
$18.5Million was discovered and traced to be owned by one late Engineer =
Douglas Briggs, a foreigner who died in a crash. The source of this fund =
was further traced to be a contract payment made to him but has remained =
unclaimed till now. Since his death, nobody has shown up to claim this =
fund and this attracted our curiosity. I therefore made a research and =
found out that he did not leave any next of kin in his confidential =
document with the Ministry that he executed the contract for and also =
with our Bank. A panel setup by the Federal Government on recovery of =
funds expects that this fund should be unquestionably claimed by any of =
his available foreign next of kin or alternatively the fund should be =
donated for arms and ammunition at a military war college here in =
Nigeria.<BR>
<BR>
Fervent valuable efforts were made by the Panel to get in touch with any =
of the family or relatives but all have proved to no avail. It is =
because of the perceived possibility of not going to be able to locate =
any next of kin (he had no wife and children) that the panel under the =
influence of our chairman, Rtd Major General Thomas Dan Ababa, that =
arrangement is being made for the fund to be declared UNCLAIMABLED and =
then be donated to the Trust Fund for arms and ammunition which will =
further enhance the perpetration of war in Africa and the third world in =
general. To forestall this move, my colleagues and I have taken it upon =
ourselves to source for a foreign partner who could assist in claiming =
this fund for further transfer abroad. I have been given the sole =
mandate to source for a partner as soon as possible to that effect.<BR>
<BR>
All documents and proof to enable you get this fund have been carefully =
worked out and I am assuring you a 100% risk free involvement. Your =
share would be 30% of the total amount if you agree to assist while 10% =
would be set aside to offset all expenses in course of the transfer and =
the rest would be for us for investment purposes in your country after =
the transfer. If this proposal is OK by you, and you do wish to take the =
advantage of the trust we hope to bestow on you or your company, then =
kindly reach me Immediately via my confidential email account =
&lt;ossaaihenryx4@wanadoo.es&gt; furnishing me with your most =
confidential telephone and fax numbers and exclusive email so that I can =
forward to you the relevant details of the transaction.<BR>
<BR>
I will be waiting for your response. My telephone number is +234 803 650 =
4986.<BR>

Regards,<BR>
