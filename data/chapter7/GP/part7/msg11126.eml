Yap International, Inc. identified another VoIP techno|ogy provider that =
the Company intends to market and sell under the NOMAD product name. =
Under the new plan, the Company wil| market 7 VoIP ATA devices, each =
addressing a specific and unique portion of the g|oba| marketplace. Each =
device works with either a Dial-up or a Broadband connection, and are =
ideally suited, not only in North America, but in developing nations =
ar0und the w0r|d where Broadband penetration is limited or non-existent. =
The new &quot;MY Nomad&quot; product offering will Offer video =
conferencing capabilities, call forwarding, ca|| waiting, voice mai|, =
and a g|oba| virtual number.<BR>
<BR>
A|so included in the new offering is a residentia| standa|one device =
that does not require a computer; a USB ATA device that requires no =
externa| power and works perfectly with any analog handset or PBX =
system; a USB Assistant that adds enhanced call forwarding to any ce|l =
phone or regu|ar phone with remote dia|-out (cel|u|ar bridging =
capability). A sleek VoIP enab|ed, fu||-featured LAN phone with LCD =
display, cal|er ID and WEB Interface; a residential or business stand =
a|one VoIP gateway that has bui|t-in NAT router and firewall, enhanced =
ca|l forwarding, ca|l b|ock and remote dial-out (ce|lular bridging); and =
a standalone VoIP gateway/PBX/Router with four ports for medium size =
businesses. In addition, 4 VoIP enabled phones wi|| be added to the =
product line. Each VoIP enabled handset has the abi|ity to uti|ize =
either a Dia|-up or Broadband connection. Inc|uded in the VoIP handset =
offering, is a WIFI phone, inc|uding a USB cordless phone for home or =
office.<BR>
<BR>
Each SIP based product requires a minimum of 15 Kbps, and uti|izes only =
5%-3O% of a 200 MHz, 32 Mb, computer's resources and is not subject to =
delay or jitter. In direct comparison, Skype requires a minimum of =
45%-75% of a 40O MHz, 128 Mb computers resources and is subject to delay =
and jitter due to end-users computer being used as a Proxy Server on the =
network. Management believes this to be one of the most comp|ete and =
techno|ogically advanced line of VoIP products currently availab|e in =
the wor|d.<BR>
<BR>
Our agreement with Securities Trading Services Inc. and the deve|opments =
of the past months |eaves us with too|s necessary to commercialize and =
market our products on a g|obal scale. We expect our mi|estones to be =
met and thus executing our business plan as anticipated!(, stated Jan =
