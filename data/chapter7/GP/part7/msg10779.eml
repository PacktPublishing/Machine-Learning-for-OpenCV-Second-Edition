--------------------<BR>

DSN Retailing Today<BR>
-------------------<BR>
The fact that the $31 billion pet industry prospered through the =
2001-2003 recession shows that people are willing to spend<BR>
money on their pets even during tough times. And in the past few years, =
much of that money has been going !<BR>
toward sales of natural pet foods and treats... Click here for =

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D<BR>
Retail sales of pet food are projected for a steady climb, rising to an =
estimated $16.7 billion by 2008.<BR>
<BR>
Sales in the natural food and supplement category are increasing by =
double digits each year as consumers grow more<BR>
aware of what goes into their pets' food.<BR>

RYPM plans to make synergistic acquisitions to propel faster growth and =
gain market dominance<BR>

RYPM Plans expansion of services into &quot;niche&quot; markets<BR>
<BR>
Management believes that it would be entirely realistic for the Company =
to capture at least one percent of the market each<BR>
year for i! ts first five years in the business.This would equate to =
revenues growing from $200 million in its first year of<BR>
operations to in excess of $1 billion annually (just 5% of market share) =
five years out!<BR>

Corporate Snapshot<BR>
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D<BR>
Royal Pet Meals, Inc. is an emerging growth development and management =
company that specializes in using niche marketing<BR>
techniques to deliver &quot;specialty&quot; pet foods/products to the =
rapidly expanding $34 billion (2004 estimate) pet products industry.<BR>
Royal Pet Meal products are all premium meal selections, natural, =
organic, and wholesome, all designed to improve the<BR>
quality of life for pet and pet owners. Since a large percentage of this =
booming pet market is serviced by small business vendors,<BR>
Royal Pet Meals management feels that! this highly fragmented =
marketplace lends itself to both niche marketing and consolidation<BR>
of vendors. Royal Pet Meals, Inc. intends to capture various niche =
markets and acquire/merge with selected profitable vendors,<BR>
realizing significant revenue and profit growth as a result.<BR>
<BR>
Analyst Conclusion<BR>
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D<BR>
The recent SEC ruling to leave the Over The Counter Bulletin Board in =
its current form is a very bullish sign for this market - possibly<BR>
a turning point. We think that this is an encouraging signal from =
regulators that the OTCBB can expect a more positive financial<BR>
climate going forward. We assessed RYPM and found it met our 4 basic =
investment criteria:<BR>
<BR>
1. Clearly RYPM has enormous growth potential.<BR>
2. The company financials are strong.<BR>
3. RYPM is in a leading i! ndustry.<BR>
4. RYPM is offered at an ideal Buy Point.<BR>
<BR>
Pets are big business and everyone is getting interested. In the space =
of the past four weeks, the Today Show has run two segments,<BR>
the CBS Early Show each ran a segment, ABC World News Tonight ran a =
piece, US News and World Report ran a piece about<BR>
Global Pet Expo and The Wall Street Journal ran an article on the =
industry. This is in addition to the numerous articles run in<BR>
everything from the LA Times and Washington Post to the East Nowhere =
Gazette Sun Journal.<BR>
The word is out and we all should be ready to take advantage of it.<BR>
