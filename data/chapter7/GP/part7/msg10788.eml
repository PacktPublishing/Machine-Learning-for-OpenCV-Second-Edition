LAS VEGAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 3, 2005--Carnegie Cooke &amp; Company, =
Inc. (CGKY.PK)<BR>
is in the process of acquiring two new locations in Niteroi, the island =
city adjoining Rio de Janeiro.<BR>
Niteroi is one of the most affluent suburbs in Brazil. Its population is =
greater than 500,000<BR>
with a daily average of 300,000 commuters. These potential new locations =
are in addition<BR>
to the existing domestic revenue generating OTB's currently being =
expanded in Campos and Macae.<BR>
Carnegie Cooke recently signed a three year contract, with an option for =
three additional years,<BR>
for exclusivity with the Jockey Club de Campus to operate both domestic =
and international simulcast signals<BR>
related to the turf industry throughout the state of Rio de Janeiro.<BR>
<BR>
With ownership of the Campus facility, the domestic betting signal =
allows access<BR>
to forty existing accredited domestic simulcast signal OTB's within the =
state of Rio de Janeiro.<BR>
Management is in the process of analyzing these sites for the inclusion =
into its expanding OTB network.<BR>
<BR>
A $1,000 dollar investment could yield a $5,000 dollar profit in<BR>
just one trade if you trade out at the top. CGKY should be one of the =
most<BR>
profitable stocks to trade this year. In this range the stock has<BR>
potential to move in either direction in big wings. This means you =
should be able to buy at the<BR>
lows and sell at the highs for months to come.<BR>
<BR>
***Make no mistake: Our mission at Hot-Stocks-Investors is to claw our =
way through<BR>
the thousands of underperforming companies out there to find the golden =
needle in the haystack<BR>
the micro-cap DIAMOND that can make you rich. More often than not, the =
stocks we profile show<BR>
a significant increase in stock price and sometimes in days, not months =
or years.<BR>
<BR>
IF YOU ARE RECEIVING THIS EMAIL, YOU ARE AMONG THE FIRST PUBLIC =
INVESTORS TO KNOW ABOUT<BR>
CGKY !!! WE WISH YOU LUCK AND REMEMBER THE SAYING, TRADE AT THE =
TOP!!!<BR>
