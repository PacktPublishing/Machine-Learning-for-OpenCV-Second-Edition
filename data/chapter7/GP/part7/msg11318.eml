Looking To Revolutionize the Way Music is Promoted and Sampled<BR>
Sounds 24-7, Inc.(OTC:SDSS)<BR>
Current Price: $.05<BR>
<BR>
Possibilty of Huge Day Tuesday as a Massive PR Campaign Launches This 3 =
Day<BR>
Weekend.<BR>
<BR>
Imagine how well your portfolio would have done the last five weeks if =
you<BR>
had the scoop on the f0ll@owing Small Cap Sto*ck:<BR>
<BR>
(OTCBB-LENF)Closed September 1st at $.75. This SmallCap traded over =
$3.60<BR>
on Friday, an absolutely massive gain of over 375% for investors who got =
in<BR>
early. Face it, Some of these Small Sto\cks Really Move!<BR>
<BR>
Let's Look at Today's Featured Company, Sounds 24-7, Inc.(OTC-SDSS)<BR>
<BR>
About The Company: CHANGING THE FACE OF THE MUSIC AND RECORDING =
INDUSTRY!<BR>
<BR>
Sounds 24-7, Inc., is changing the way music from Major Labels, =
Independent<BR>
Labels and Artists are marketed, promoted and distributed to today's<BR>
proliferation of listening outlets. The numbers seem to be =
unmanageable:<BR>
<BR>
85,000 traditional, internet, satellite, commercial, non-commercial =
and<BR>
college radio stations, 8.5 million Independent Artists with =
commercial<BR>
music, 10,000 club DJs, and Sounds 24-7 estimates there are more than =
12<BR>
million new CD titles produced annually. Today, as in yesterday, music =
sales<BR>
continue to be driven by the Consumer first hearing the music as a =
prelude<BR>
to the purchase of music. The Consumer now supplements his/her =
Tradional<BR>
Radio Listening with tens of thousands of other radio stations. Sounds =
24-7<BR>
of/fers ins-t@nt access to all stations, all music with the largest =
catalog<BR>
of music anywhere that is building to the availability of multi-millions =
of<BR>
tracks of songs. Sounds 24-7 is not a company which provides music to =
the<BR>
listening public.<BR>
<BR>
Sounds 24-7's distribution solution that is a proprietary system of =
music<BR>
with advanced security technology, which reaches all listening outlets =
and<BR>
is open to all Labels (Major and Independent) and all Artists. The =
Major<BR>
Labels are 0f`fered access to Sounds 24-7's distribution system at =
zero<BR>
cost, without any changes to the &quot;rules of usage&quot; and only =
pay, if they so<BR>
choose, for playtime reporting. Radio stations and club DJs receive =
Sounds<BR>
24-7 at zero cost. Independent Labels and Artists pay a nominal fee to =
be<BR>
included in Sounds 24-7's Library.<BR>
<BR>
In the weeks and months to come, Sounds 24-7 will be building =
revolutionary<BR>
and profitable relationships with the labels and artists as Sounds =
24-7<BR>
build what will become the largest library of music available anywhere. =
At<BR>
the same time, credentials and passwords will be allotted to radio =
stations<BR>
and club DJ's, but only after they are screened for legitimacy. All =
these<BR>
relationships will be carefully cultivated to result in maximum<BR>
effectiveness for all concerned.<BR>

Will SDSS explode higher next week as more and more investors become =
aware<BR>
of the Sto&gt;ck? If you think so, you may not want to wait until it is =
too<BR>
late. Like many of these Sto&amp;cks, it may move quickly and timing =
is<BR>
critical.<BR>
<BR>
Remember the Symbol- &quot;SDSS&quot;. Good Luck and Successful =
Trading!<BR>

Information within this email contains &quot;forward looking =
statements&quot; within<BR>
the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21B =
of<BR>
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Any statements that express or =
involve<BR>
discussions with respect to predictions, expectations, beliefs, =
plans,<BR>
projections, objectives, goals, assumptions or future events or =
performance<BR>
are not statements of historical fact and may be &quot;forward =
looking<BR>
statements.&quot;Forward looking statements are based on expectations, =
estimates<BR>
and projections at the time the statements are made that involve a =
number of<BR>
risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results or events to =
differ<BR>
materially from those presently anticipated. Forward looking statements =
in<BR>
this action may be identified through the use of words such as =
&quot;projects&quot;,<BR>
&quot;foresee&quot;, &quot;expects&quot;, &quot;will&quot;, =
&quot;anticipates&quot;, &quot;estimates&quot;, =
&quot;believes&quot;,<BR>
&quot;understands&quot; or that by statements indicating certain actions =
&quot;may,&quot;<BR>
&quot;could,&quot; or &quot;might&quot; occur. As with many microcap =
Sto#cks, today's company<BR>
has additional risk factors that raise doubt about its ability to =
continue<BR>
as a going concern. Sounds 24-7 Inc. is not a reporting company =
registered<BR>
under the Securities Act of 1934 and hence there is limited =
information<BR>
available about the company. It is not currently an operating company =
and<BR>
has not had business operations for over one year. Other factors =
include: an<BR>
accumulated deficit, a negative net worth, a nominal cash position and =
no<BR>
revenue in its most recent quarter. The company is going to need =
financing.<BR>
If that financing does not occur, the company may not be able to =
continue as<BR>
a going concern in which case you could lose your entire investment. =
