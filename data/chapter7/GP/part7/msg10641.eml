CONFIDENTIAL.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
ATTENTION: DIRECTOR,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
You may be surprised to receive this message from me since you don't =
know me in person, but for the purpose of introduction, I am STEVE =
WILLIAMS, the son of late MR. MICHAEL WILLIAMS, who was murdered in a =
land dispute in ZIMBABWE.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
You contact was given to me at the SOUTH AFRICA EXCHANGE NETWORK ON LINE =
here in Johannesburg as reliable and trustworthy to deal with, and then =
I decided to write you. My late father was among the few black =
Zimbabwean rich farmers murdered in cold blood by the agent of the =
ruling government of president ROBERT MUGABE for his alleged support and =
sympathy for Zimbabwean opposition party. Which we communicated to the =
whole world through BBC AND CNN.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Before the death of my father, he took me to SOUTH AFRICA to deposit the =
sum of TWENTY MILLION US Dollars ($20M) with a security and finance =
company, as if he knew the looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money was =
deposited as a gem or precious stone to avoid much demurrage from the =
security firm. This money was earmarked for the purchase of new =
machinery and chemicals for the farms and the establishment of new farms =
in Lesotho and Swaziland.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This land problem arose when president R. MUGABE introduced a new land =
Act. Which wholly affects the white rich farmers and some few blacks =
vehemently condemned the 'MODUS OPERANDI' adopted by the government. =
This resulted to rampant killing and mob actions. I and my family who =
are currently staying in South Africa as a refugee or an asylum seeker =
have decided to transfer this money to a foreign country where we can =
invest it. I am faced with the dilemma of investing this amount of money =
in South Africa for fear of encountering the same experience in future =
since both countries have the same political history. Moreover, the =
South African monetary policy/law does not allow such investment hence I =
am seeking for an asylum or refugee.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I must let you know that this business is 100% risk free and the nature =
of your business does not necessary matter. So if you are willing to =
assist us, I and my family have agreed to give you 20% of the total =
money, 40% will be for a joint business venture I will be doing with you =
and another 35% will be for me and my family which we shall also invest =
in your country and the remaining 5% will be mapped out for all expenses =
we may incurred during the transaction.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Therefore, if you are willing and interested to render the needed =
assistance, endeavour to reply through the above tel/fax No. I also need =
your private phone and fax number for easy communication. Remember that =
this is highly confidential and the success of this business depends on =
how secret it is kept.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Expecting your reply soonest.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Best Regards.<BR>
<BR>
