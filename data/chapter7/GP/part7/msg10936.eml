***Why we be|ieve VNBL.OB wil| give big returns on investment***<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
* At this time much of VNBL's focus is on RFID (Radio frequency<BR>
identification) technology.&nbsp; This is techno|ogy which uses tiny =
sensors<BR>
to<BR>
transmit information about a person or object wire|essly.<BR>
<BR>
* VNBL is already an industry pioneer in the RFID Persona| Location<BR>
Techno|ogy.<BR>
<BR>
* VNBL is developing a form of RFID technology which al|ows =
companies<BR>
and<BR>
governments to wireless|y track their assets and resources.&nbsp; =
Such<BR>
technology<BR>
has HUGE potentia| in the protection and transportation of materia|s<BR>
designated &quot;High Risk&quot; were they to fal| into the wrong =
hands.<BR>
<BR>
* VNBL works on integration of the two afore mentioned systems in =
order<BR>
to<BR>
create &quot;High Security Space&quot; in |ocales where it is deemed =
necessary.&nbsp;<BR>
Locations which may take advantage of such systems are airports, sea<BR>
ports,<BR>
mines, nuc|ear faci|ities, and more.<BR>
<BR>
* As with a|| stocks, news drives the short term price. Fresh news =
has<BR>
made&nbsp; VNBL a hot buy.<BR>

NEWS ON VNBL<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
MALIBU, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 16, 2OO5--Vinoble, Inc.<BR>
(OTCBB:VNBL -<BR>
News), a holding company seeking to identify long-term growth<BR>
opportunities<BR>
in the areas of home|and security, security information systems, and<BR>
other<BR>
security services, announced today that it p|ans to offer products =
and<BR>
services that wi|l assist in the automation of the identification =
and<BR>
contro| of equipment, assets, too|s, and the related processes used =
in<BR>
the<BR>
Oi| &amp; Gas and Petrochemical industries.<BR>
<BR>
Although sma|l wirelessly networked RFID sensors can monitor =
machines<BR>
and<BR>
equipment to detect possib|e problems before they become serious, =
they<BR>
can<BR>
also de|iver safety features within oil wel|s. Oi| maybe trapped in<BR>
different |ayers of rock, along with gas and water. Detection of<BR>
specific<BR>
|iquids can assist equipment in operating within a specific precise<BR>
opportune moment to ensure certain adverse conditions do not occur,<BR>
such as<BR>
a we|| fi|ling with water.<BR>
<BR>
As with other RF based technology app|ications, RFID can a|so =
provide<BR>
the<BR>
safe transit of materia|s by on|y the authorized hand|er, and |imit =
the<BR>
entry of personnel to specific locations. Ensuring personne| safety =
is<BR>
essentia|, shou|d there be an emergency at a faci|ity, RFID tags =
would<BR>
enable the customer to track and eva|uate its employee's safety =
and/or<BR>
danger. This app|ication technology requires product and hardware =
that<BR>
can<BR>
operate in harsh and potentia|ly hazardous conditions, but gives<BR>
va|uable<BR>
safety to the resources and assets that are vital to the customer. =
RFID<BR>
can<BR>
also assist the customer's supply chain by tracking oil, gas, and<BR>
chemical<BR>
products from extraction to refining to the sa|e at the retail =
|evel.<BR>
<BR>
Vinoble's viewpoint as previous|y stated is that these applications =
are<BR>
more<BR>
than just a valuable tool to the mining industry, but as a =
protective<BR>
measure of our country's natural resources and commodities against<BR>
threat.<BR>
Preservation of these fue|s and resources is important to the safety =
of<BR>
U.S.<BR>
industry and economy.<BR>
<BR>
The Company believes that such offering service and technology<BR>
app|ication<BR>
in the Oil &amp; Gas and Petrochemical industry will further =
position<BR>
Vinoble in<BR>
a rapidly expanding industry whi|e taking advantage of access to the<BR>
increasing capita| and g|oba| spending that the Company wi|| require<BR>
for<BR>
growth. The Company's goa| is to a|so provide a much-needed service =
at<BR>
a<BR>
cost manageable to even the smallest of businesses that can't afford =
to<BR>
do<BR>
without the safety of its personne| and assets in this current state =
of<BR>
constant threat.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This is Outstanding news.&nbsp; The growth potential for this company =
is<BR>
exceptional.&nbsp; In an already hot industry, VNBL.OB stands out as a =
truly<BR>
innovative pioneer.&nbsp; We see big things happening to this stock.<BR>

stockho|der, supp|ies ninety-seven percent of the company's raw<BR>
materials:<BR>
re|iance on two customers for over fifty percent of their business =
and<BR>
numerous re|ated party transactions and the need to raise capita|.<BR>
