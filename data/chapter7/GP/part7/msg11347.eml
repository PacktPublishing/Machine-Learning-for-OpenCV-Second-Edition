discussions with respect to predictions, expectations, beliefs, =

projections, objectives, goals, assumptions or future events or =

are not statements of historical fact and may be &quot;forward =
looking<BR>
statements.&quot;Forward looking statements are based on expectations, =
estimates<BR>
and projections at the time the statements are made that involve a =
number of<BR>

materially from those presently anticipated. Forward looking statements =
in<BR>
this action may be identified through the use of words such as =

stocks, today's company has<BR>
additional risk factors that raise doubt about its ability to continue =
as a<BR>
going concern. Today's featured company is not a reporting company<BR>
registered under the Securities Act of 1934 and hence there is =
limited<BR>
information available about the company. Other factors include a =
limited<BR>
operating history, a nominal cash position and nominal revenues in its =
most<BR>
recent quarter. The company is going to need financing. If that =
financing<BR>
does not occur,the company may not be able to complete some proposed<BR>
transactions and the company may not be able to continue as a going =
concern<BR>
in which case you could lose your entire investment. Other risks and<BR>
uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the ability of the =
Company to<BR>
complete its business plan,reliance on key personnel, market conditions, =
the<BR>
general acceptance of the Company's products and technologies, =
competitive<BR>
factors, timing, and other risks associated with their business. The<BR>
