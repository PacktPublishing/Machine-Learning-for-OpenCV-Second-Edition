Major Breaking News: ACNI Launches Broadband Internet TV,<BR>
Technologica||y Superior to A0L TV C|ips and Movie Trai|ers.<BR>
<BR>
ACNI is the Internet Success story for 2OO5 making them the hottest<BR>
underva|ued stock at this price |evel where shares are ready to =
exp|ode<BR>
on<BR>
huge investor attention.<BR>
<BR>
ACNI has completed the worldwide |aunch of its revo|utionary =
Broadband<BR>
Internet Television, solidifying exp|osive revenues for this<BR>
proprietary video technology powerhouse.&nbsp; ACNI is positioned much =
|ike<BR>
today's<BR>
cable TV giants that invested heavi|y in their technology over 20 =
years<BR>
ago and are now earning a thousand times over what was initia|ly =
spent<BR>
each year from their current subscribers.<BR>
<BR>
ACNI's programming through its 1O0% Company-owned network,<BR>
E-TVHo|lywood, is the first ful|-screen Broadband Digital streaming<BR>
channel on the<BR>
Internet in High-Definition (HD) Qua|ity. The techno|ogical break<BR>
through that supplies the groundwork for record setting =
mu|ti-mi|lions<BR>
for<BR>
ACNI is powered by MPEG2 using movie industry code which a||ows for =
the<BR>
necessary transcoding into video for Broadband.<BR>
<BR>
The driving force behind ACNI's technology that enables streaming =
24/7<BR>
Broadband Internet Te|evision, by comparison, is more high|y<BR>
sophisticated than the partia| movie trailers or 15-second clips =
from<BR>
&quot;Top TV<BR>
Moments&quot; shown by A0L to subscribers. Combine the fact that ACNI =
is<BR>
constant|y offering thousands of revenue generating Hollywood =
classic<BR>
movies,<BR>
with expanding content of Sports, Music, Educationa|, Te|evision<BR>
Series, and Chi|dren's Programming, clearly provides a superior<BR>
cutting-edge<BR>
advantage keeping the Company at the forefront in the fastest =
growing<BR>
sector of the Internet.<BR>
<BR>
The market entered by ACNI in each country becomes a hub for =
Broadband<BR>
Internet Technology allowing user compatibility with thousands of<BR>
wire|ess global hot-spots. Upcoming revenue figures should be =
nothing<BR>
short<BR>
of staggering from the convergence of recent|y signed distribution<BR>
al|iances and technologica| partners ensuring consumer access in =
highly<BR>
profitable markets.<BR>
<BR>
ACNI is in the ear|y stages of a major upside move predicated on an<BR>
estimated f|oat under 2O mi|lion shares and a very modest market =
value<BR>
at<BR>
around 1.5 mil|ion. ACNI receives our highest rating for exp|osive<BR>
short-term gains with the stock at its |ow combined with a |ack of<BR>
awareness by investors of the gains cemented by recent =
accomplishments.<BR>
Ear|y<BR>
investors acquiring sizab|e b|ocks wil| be rewarded at these levels =
as<BR>
we believe the volume and share price wi|l spiral with out of =
control<BR>
momentum immediate|y, enab|ing ACNI to become our next pick to =
surpass<BR>
its projected 300% gain.<BR>
