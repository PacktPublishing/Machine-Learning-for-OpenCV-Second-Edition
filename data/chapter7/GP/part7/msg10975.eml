<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>There is this free date site filled with tons of =
sex-addicts.<BR>
No flowers, no gifts, just meet up for action :)<BR>
<BR>
There are also a few who want a serious relationship though<BR>
So if you want a long-termer, or a one-nighter, you got it ;)<BR>
Whatever floats your boat pretty much!<BR>
