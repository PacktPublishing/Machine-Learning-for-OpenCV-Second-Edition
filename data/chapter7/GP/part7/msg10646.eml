<p><font color=3D"#C0C0C0">Risky jobThe astronaut will be dangled from a =
robotic arm on the international space station and maneuvered to the =
bottom of Discovery to remove the gap fillers -- thin fabric stiffened =
with a ceramic material that is used to plug gaps between tiles on the =
orbiter.In a history-making repair during Wednesday's spacewalk, =
Discovery astronaut Steve Robinson will come within feet of the =
shuttle's underbelly and gently pluck filler material sticking out from =
between heat-resistant tiles in two places on the orbiter.The airport =
said the bad weather prompted it to issue a "red alert" ground stop =
earlier in the afternoon, forcing some flight delays. He thanked the =
astronauts for being "risk takers for the sake of =
exploration."</font></p>
