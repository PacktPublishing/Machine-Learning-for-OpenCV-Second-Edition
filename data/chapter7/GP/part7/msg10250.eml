RE: TRANSFER OF US$48.223 MILLION{FORTY EIGHT MILLION TWO HUNDRED =
&amp;<BR>
TWENTY&nbsp; THREE THOUSAND U.S DOLLARS ONLY} TO YOUR ACCOUNT. =
[STRICTLY<BR>
CONFIDENTIAL]<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I feel quite safe dealing with you in this important business having<BR>
gone through your remarkable profile on the internet. Though, this<BR>
medium (Internet) has been greatly abused, I choose to reach you =
through<BR>
it&nbsp; because it still remains the fastest medium of communication. =
However,<BR>
this correspondence is unofficial and private, and it should be treated =
as<BR>
such.<BR>
<BR>
At first I will like to assure you that this transaction is 100% =
risk<BR>
and trouble free to both parties.<BR>
<BR>
My name is Dr. Collumbus Walter From, I work as the operational =
manager<BR>
in account management section in charge of credit and foreign bills of =
one<BR>
of the prime banks here in South Africa. On a routine inspection I<BR>
discovered a dormant domiciliary account with a Balance Of<BR>
US$48,223,000. 00 (Forty eight&nbsp; million two hundred and twenty =
three<BR>
thousand U.S dollar).On further&nbsp; discreet investigation, I also =
discovered<BR>
that the account holder has&nbsp; died long ago with his family on a =
fatal<BR>
Auto-accident leaving no beneficiary to&nbsp; the account and no other =
person<BR>
knows about this account. I am in close contact with the manager of =
the<BR>
bank here who is my partner and he is willing to approve the transfer =
to<BR>
any reliable and&nbsp; trustworthy foreigner with foreign bank account =
because<BR>
the former operator of the a/c is a foreigner and from Australia in<BR>
particular.&nbsp; I am certainly sure that he has no writen or oral =
WILL<BR>
attached to the account , no beneficiary and nobody will come again =
for<BR>
the claim of this money.<BR>
<BR>
It is only a foreigner who can claim this money with legal claims to<BR>
the account holder which I will provide to you if you are =
interested,<BR>
therefore I need your cooperation&nbsp; in this transaction. The =
difference in<BR>
country<BR>
of origins is not a hindrance to the success of this transaction. =
This<BR>
money will remain useless in this&nbsp; dormant account if I did not =
transfer<BR>
the fund out to a foreign account.<BR>
<BR>
I will provide the necessary information and documents needed in =
order<BR>
to claim this money. I only need your cooperation as a foreigner to<BR>
provide your safe bank account information for the transfer. All<BR>
arrangement that will ensure a smooth transfer of the fund to the =
account<BR>
which you are to nominate is already in place.You should also provide =
me<BR>
with your direct phone lines for easy communication. I wish for =
utmost<BR>
confidentiality in handling this transaction.<BR>
<BR>
At the conclussion of this transaction, your share will be 25% of =
the<BR>
total transfer sum, 70% for me and my partner while 5% will be set<BR>
aside for any expenses both parties might incure during the process of =
the<BR>
transfer.<BR>
<BR>
The&nbsp; fund will be transferred to your account in two parts. I =
will<BR>
first transfer USD 20 Million to your account. I will fly over to meet =
you<BR>
after the successful transfer for sharing according to the agreed<BR>
percentages. I will&nbsp; have the remaining balance&nbsp; of USD28,223 =
Million<BR>
transferred to your account only after the successful sharing of the =
first<BR>
transfer without any disappointment from your side.<BR>
Have a nice day as I entrust this transfer into your hands.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Let me hear from you Urgently.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Best Regards,<BR>
Dr. Walter.<BR>
