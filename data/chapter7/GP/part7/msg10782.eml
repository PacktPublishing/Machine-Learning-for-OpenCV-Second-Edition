Is This an Undiscovered Gem that is Positioned to Go Higher? Review<BR>
Exactly What this Company Does.<BR>
<BR>
Breaking News!!<BR>
<BR>
Tiger Team Technologies Corporation (TTMT) has had an extremely<BR>
positive first half of year 2005. The company set out goals in the =
beginning<BR>
of the year, but did not foresee the progress that it has made. So =
far<BR>
this year the company has secured short term funding, receeived a =
clean<BR>
bill of health from its auditors and is therefore ready to file the<BR>
necessary paperwork with the SEC to move to a better exchange, and<BR>
finally, as noted in the previous press release dated June 25, 2004, =
the<BR>
company is now being aggressively marketed in the Pacific Rim.<BR>
<BR>
Therefore, because Tiger Team has made inroads with major online<BR>
retailers and internet transaction processors and wants to better =
service its<BR>
clients here in the US and now being recruited in the Pacific Rim, =
the<BR>
company has opened a new office in the San Francisco Bay Area. This<BR>
office will compliment the one currently located where the company =
is<BR>
headquartered in St. Paul, Minnesota. The company continues to =
garner<BR>
interest from many market sectors and companies around the globe; thus, =
an<BR>
expansion was only a natural outcome of the amazzing growth =
experienced<BR>
this year.<BR>
<BR>
Tiger Team Technologies Corporation (TTMT) is pleased to announce =
that<BR>
it has entered into a marketing agreement with Modern World Media, a<BR>
leading Japanese marketing gr0up , to promote its products and =
services<BR>
in the Japanese and Asian markets. This deal opens a completely new<BR>
avenue for potential revenue and exposure as Tiger Team now looks to =
expand<BR>
beyond the U.S. borders.<BR>
<BR>
Having a consistent presence in these two markets can only enhance =
the<BR>
company's stature and in the long run, its profitability. A =
satisfied<BR>
Paul Hogan, CEO of Tiger Team Technologies, stated that &quot;the =
0pp0rtunity<BR>
for the company to introduce its products and services into the most<BR>
sophisticated and fastest growing market in the world not only gives =
the<BR>
company and international scope but will impact the company's bottom<BR>
line in very significant ways for years to come.<BR>
<BR>
Modern World Media specializes in introducing new and innovative<BR>
technologies to the Japanese and Asian markets, and is highly selective =
in<BR>
the products and services that it chooses to introduce into the =
primary<BR>
markets. Therefore, besides being excited about the prospects of =
having<BR>
its product being marketed one of the fastest growing economic =
regions,<BR>
Tiger Team also feels honored of having been chosen since the =
selection<BR>
process by World Media is that stringent.<BR>
<BR>
About the Company<BR>
<BR>
Tiger Team Technologies (T3), is a leading developer of proprietary<BR>
technical and business processes transforming business operations of<BR>
medical service providers through state-of-the-art communication =
hardware<BR>
and software technologies. T3 has developed auditrac to track =
documents<BR>
and transmissions in conjunction with an innovative risk management<BR>
program through it Financial Services Unit to limit client exposure in =
the<BR>
HIPAA environment. These processes guaranteee and secure electronic<BR>
file transmission in accordance with federal mandated HIPAA =
compliance<BR>
requirements. This translates to total patient privacy and security =
which<BR>
is key to reducing the risk and exposure and thus 0ffer a reduction =
in<BR>
medical premiums placed on providers. Based in St. Paul, MN, the<BR>
Company seeks to pursue an aggressive growth strategy targeted at =
corporate<BR>
and individual medical practices by leveraging this exclusive<BR>
transmission process as an incentive for the medical community to =
outsource<BR>
existing services.<BR>
