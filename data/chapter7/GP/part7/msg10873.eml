<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>&quot;My girlfriend and me have been really enjoying =
making<BR>
our own homemade erotic films. We get off on pretending<BR>
to be like porn stars even though it will only ever be<BR>
the two of us that see them. The one thing that was really<BR>
missing from our movies was the money shot and to be frank<BR>
I was lucky if my money shot was worth a dollar. I<BR>
ordered Spur-M and now all of our home movies end in a<BR>
gigantic cum shot that would make even veteran porn<BR>
stars jealous. Thanks Spur-M for helping to spice up<BR>
our sex life!&quot;<BR>

&quot;My wife and I cannot afford the prices for IVF treatment.<BR>
After I tried Spur-M, I found that my sperm motility was<BR>
improving as each month went by. Now I have a healthy baby<BR>
girl. Spur-M helped me so much with improving my own<BR>
fertility and I just want to say thanks. This is fantastic<BR>
to be able to see a real natural IVF alternative, which is<BR>
much cheaper than the prices for IVF!!!&quot;<BR>

&quot;Spur-M really works. It has improved my sperm motility<BR>
and morphology to the point that my girlfriend is now pregnant.<BR>
This fertility blend really does help to improve male<BR>
fertility and sperm quality!&quot;<BR>

<BR>
&quot;I tried Spur-M fertility blend for men for 3 months and<BR>
noticed a lot of improvements in my sperm quality. I am<BR>
surprised they don't make this product more widely available.<BR>
It helped my tremendously, and I will be telling people<BR>
about its effectiveness.&quot;<BR>
