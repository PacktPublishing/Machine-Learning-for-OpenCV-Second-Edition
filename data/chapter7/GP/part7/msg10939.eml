NEWS: Smart Global Gets m-Wise to the Benefits of a Bespoke Platform<BR>
<BR>
LONDON,&nbsp; (PRIMEZONE) -- London-based Smart Global, the UK's =
first<BR>
one-stop-shop for mobile data services targeted at SMEs, today announced =
its<BR>
partnership with m-Wise Inc (OTC BB:MWIS.OB - News). m-Wise, a =
leading<BR>
technology provider in the field of content management and provisioning =
has<BR>
developed a tailored solution to suit Smart Global's offering, which =
is<BR>
delivered in partnership with network operator O2. The m-Wise =
Platform<BR>
enables Smart Global to offer an end-to-end service to mobile =
subscribers<BR>
from online registration and over-the-air delivery of the service =
directly<BR>
to the customer's mobile device, to flexible real-time =
subscription-based<BR>
billing. The system also allows subscribers full access to their =
account,<BR>
allowing them to manage the services, add users and view all related<BR>
information. The Platform is connected to more than 10 technology =
vendors,<BR>
as well as to various billing, SMS and MMS providers. In total 12 =
business<BR>
mobile services are offered.<BR>
<BR>
Says Rachel Perry, COO of Smart Global: &quot;We have spent two years =
developing<BR>
a suite of applications that meet the requirements of small and =
medium<BR>
businesses and believe that by removing the need for expensive,<BR>
time-consuming back office installation and IT integration we have =
presented<BR>
the ultimate solution to the market.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Last time we issued a Investor Alert and watched it climb from $2.00 =
to<BR>
$8.00 faster than you can count the ways to spend your money.<BR>
Now MWIS is on the on the move!<BR>
