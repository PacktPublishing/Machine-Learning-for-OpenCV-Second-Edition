<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>My Dear Friend,<BR>
<BR>
I am Mr Onyema Ugochukwu, the Auditor of United Bank for Africa Plc<BR>
(U.B.A). I have a confidential business suggestion for you. One of =
our<BR>
clients/personalfriend, Late Mr. Kim Sean unfortunately lost his =
life<BR>
in the plane crash on January 31st 2000 including his wife and his =
only<BR>
daughter.<BR>
<BR>
Late Mr. Kim Sean is a foreigner and the manager of Granite Minning<BR>
Nig,a chemical engineer by profession and he died since the year =
2000.<BR>
No other person knows about this account or anything concerning it.<BR>
After further investigation it was also discovered that Mr. Kim Sean's =
next<BR>
of kin is his daughter who died with him, hence the account has no =
other<BR>
beneficiary and my investigation proves to me as well that his company =
does<BR>
not know anything about this account and the amount involved is US$65 =
million.<BR>
<BR>
I am contacting you to stand and act as the next of kin to Mr. Kim<BR>
Sean.At the&nbsp; conclusion of this business, you will be given 40% of =
the<BR>
total amount, while 60% will be for me, and any expenses which you =
and<BR>
me may incur during the process of this transaction will also be =
reconciled<BR>
afterwards.<BR>
<BR>
Let me have your confidential Telephone, Fax and mobile Numbers. My<BR>
private email is: (mronyemaugochukwu2@ureach.com)<BR>
<BR>
Yours Truly,<BR>
<BR>
