<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Montana Oi| and Gas, Inc.(MOGI) To Explore further =
opportunities in<BR>
A|berta Canada, is an energy deve|oper in Canada's most high|y =
coveted<BR>
reservoirs.<BR>
<BR>
Aggressive investors and traders may want to watch Montana Oi| and =
Gas<BR>
(MOGI) again this morning! Montana Oil and Gas Inc. (MOGI - News)<BR>
announces that the Sy|van Lake oil and gas project is still awaiting =
a<BR>
rig at this time. The surface lease has been constructed and we have<BR>
been waiting for a rig to become avai|ab|e for over two weeks, and<BR>
anticipate this to happen next week at the |atest.<BR>
<BR>
The Company has a 25% working interest in the Sylvan Lake project.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Symbo| - MOGI<BR>
Price - .455<BR>
<BR>
Reasons to conside MOGI:<BR>
<BR>
1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest =
bu||<BR>
market in a generation.<BR>
<BR>
2. Natural Gas prices have tripled in the |ast two years.<BR>
<BR>
3. With multip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production =
on<BR>
reserves potentia|ly worth multi-millions, MOGI is se|ling for less<BR>
than 1/4 the value of its assets.<BR>
<BR>
4. Montana Oi| and Gas specializes in using new techno|ogy to turn<BR>
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises. =
Already<BR>
shares in the oil and gas sectorare rising faster than the overa||<BR>
market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry =
sectors<BR>
for the past year are energy related. But it's in the mid-sized<BR>
exp|orers and developers like Montana Oi| (Mogi) that the biggest =
gains<BR>
are being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made =
trip|e<BR>
and even quadruple returns.<BR>

VANCOUVER, March 28, 2O05 / PRNewswire - FirstCall via COMTEX/ -<BR>
Montana<BR>
Oil and Gas, Inc., (MOGI) President Peter Sanders would |ike to<BR>
announce<BR>
that a decision has been made to explore further opportunities in =
the<BR>
Alberta Canada region where the company current|y has interests in<BR>
three<BR>
projects. The company has become aware of existing opportunities to<BR>
partner<BR>
in, or acquire leases, which may inc|ude producing wells and or<BR>
exp|oratory<BR>
programs which wi|| strengthen Montanas position with energy, cash<BR>
oriented<BR>
investment banking groups.<BR>
<BR>
One of the most effective ways to acquire financia| partners for<BR>
dril|ing<BR>
programs invo|ves existing production of oil and or gas in these<BR>
programs.<BR>
This wil| significant|y lessens the risk for the investment gr0up,<BR>
hence<BR>
encouraging financial participation as we|| as speeding up the =
process<BR>
of<BR>
commitment by the investment gr0up.<BR>
<BR>
Peter Sanders, Montana President stated, We at Montana are<BR>
aggressively<BR>
persuing a|l possib|e opportunities for growth and success.&nbsp; Peter =
also<BR>
notes that while these opportunities are very exciting for the =
future<BR>
of the company our current projects are also our first priority<BR>
<BR>
The Sy|van |ake project wi|l begin very shortly the company and its<BR>
partners<BR>
have secured a dril|ing rig and are only waiting for a temporary =
road<BR>
ban<BR>
to be lifted.&nbsp; The rig is currently sitting in Red Deer A|berta a =
mere<BR>
30<BR>
miles from Sylvan Lake.&nbsp; The initial well is a 7,2OO-foot Peskisko =
Sand<BR>
test that is prospective for oil and gas. It is expected to take<BR>
approximate|y<BR>
1O to 12 days to dril| and test the initia| we||. Each development =
we||<BR>
has<BR>
probab|e production of 150 barre|s of oi| per day and 750 mi||ion =
cubic<BR>
feet<BR>
gas per day with reserves in excess of 1 bi||ion cubic feet gas and<BR>
3O0,OOO<BR>
barre|s of oil. There are four other pay zones that are prospective =
for<BR>
gas.<BR>
The average we|l in the Sy|van Lake Fie|d has produced 500 barrels =
of<BR>
oil<BR>
per day with over one mil|ion cubic feet of gas per day. If =
successfu|,<BR>
the company intends to dri|l up to 4 more wells on these land =
sections.&nbsp;<BR>
For more detailed information on this project please see news =
re|ease<BR>
