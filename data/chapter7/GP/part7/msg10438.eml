<BR>
Western Sierra Mining is a company on the move, fast!&nbsp; Big news is =
out!&nbsp;<BR>
Big business is afoot for WSRM!<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Read on to find out why WSRM is our TOP pick this week.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
* Western Sierra Mining has a very profitable business model in =
which<BR>
they avoid the highest cost associate with mining: =
Exploration.&nbsp;<BR>
Essentially, Wester Sierra operates mines on sites that have been =
previously<BR>
explored and found to be &quot;too small&quot; for the largest mining =
companies,<BR>
yet still produce handsome profits.<BR>
<BR>
* The global mining industry boom will continue for the foreseeable<BR>
future due to the impact of China-driven demand on commodity prices =
and<BR>
long supply-response lead times.<BR>
<BR>
* News! News! News!&nbsp; Read on to find out why we expect WSRM to take =
off<BR>
this week!<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
HERE IS RECENT NEWS ON THE COMPANY:<BR>
<BR>
PHOENIX--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 15, 2005--Western Sierra Mining Corp.<BR>
(Pink Sheets: WSRM - News) announced today that the board of =
directors<BR>
has approved and authorized a 2-for-1 forward split of its issued =
and<BR>
outstanding common s-t0ck to all shareholders of record as of June =
26,<BR>
2005.<BR>
<BR>
The company stated that the reason for the split was to allow<BR>
additional investors to participate in the long-term goals and =
objectives of<BR>
Western.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
PHOENIX--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 10, 2005--Western Sierra Mining (Pink<BR>
Sheets: WSRM - News) and OreTech Inc. (Pink Sheets: ORTE - News)<BR>
announced today that their respective boards of directors have agreed to =
enter<BR>
into an agreement to develop the Silver Plume and Pittsburg mines<BR>
located in Colorado.<BR>
<BR>
Commenting on the proposed transaction, the president of Western =
Sierra<BR>
Mining, Michael Chaffee, said, &quot;The new alignment with OreTech =
will<BR>
allow each of the companies to utilize their specific expertise to =
the<BR>
maximum benefit of the other. OreTech is trying to focus on developing =
its<BR>
propriety extraction technology and Western is expanding its mining<BR>
activities in the U.S. We have started our due diligence on the =
property<BR>
and look forward to taking a proposal back to OreTech by the end of =
the<BR>
month.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
PHOENIX--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 3, 2005--Western Sierra Mining (Pink<BR>
Sheets: WSRM - News) announced today that it has signed a Letter of =
Intent<BR>
with ASDI Corp. providing WSRM the right to develop the ASDI =
property<BR>
located in Crescent Valley at Battle Mountain, Nev.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
We cannot stress enough the significance of this news.&nbsp; A s-t0ck =
split<BR>
can only mean one thing; GOOD BUSINESS!&nbsp; With the split date set at =
June<BR>
26, NOW is obviously the time to get in.&nbsp; With repsect to the =
other<BR>
news, that a small company such as this would have the rights to =
these<BR>
rich properties speaks volumes for their management and near-future<BR>
earnings.&nbsp; That they would be so fortunate as to be involved with =
an industry<BR>
pioneer such as Oretech is nothing short of extraordinary.<BR>
<BR>
These fortuitous events have earned WSRM our highly recommendation<BR>

As with many micro-cap s-t0cks, today's company has additional risk<BR>
factors worth noting. Those factors include: a limited operating<BR>
history,<BR>
the company advancing cash to related parties and a shareholder on =
an<BR>
unsecured basis: one vendor, a related party through a majority<BR>
s-t0ckholder, supplies ninety-seven percent of the company's raw<BR>
materials:&nbsp;<BR>
reliance on two customers for over fifty percent of their business =
and<BR>
numerous related party transactions and the need to raise capital.<BR>
These<BR>
factors and others are more fully spelled out in the company's SEC<BR>
filings. We urge you to read the filings before you invest.&nbsp; The =
