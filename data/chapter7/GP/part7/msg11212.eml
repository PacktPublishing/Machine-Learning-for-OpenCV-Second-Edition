<BR><BR>Reason is our soul's left hand, faith her right, by these we =
reach divinity.



<br>One drink is too many for me and a thousand not enough.
At seventy-seven it is time to be in earnest.


<br>The beginning of anxiety is the end of faith, and the beginning of =
true faith is the end of anxiety.The fruit derived from labor is the =
sweetest of all pleasures.



The unpleasant and unacceptable face of capitalism.<BR>In peace the sons =
bury their fathers, but in war the fathers bury their sons.<br><br>Seek =
to cultivate a buoyant, joyous sense of the crowded kindnesses of God in =
your daily life.<br><br>There is no rule more invariable than that we =
are paid for our suspicions by finding what we suspect.


To succeed in the other trades, capacity must be shown in the law, =
concealment of it will do.



<br>The shortest distance between two points is under =
construction.<br><br>But evil is wrought by want of thought as well as =
want of heart!
<BR>Neither in this world nor elsewhere is there any happiness in store =
for him who always doubts.<br>We make the world we live in and shape our =
own environment.<br><br>I have never known a person to live to be one =
hundred and be remarkable for anything else.<br>Today knowledge has =
power. It controls access to opportunity and advancement.


<BR><BR>Employ thy time well, if thou meanest to gain =
leisure.<BR><BR>Childhood is the sleep of reason.<br><A =
