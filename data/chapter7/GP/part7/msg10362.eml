<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Dear Sir,<BR>
<BR>
I am Mr. said Al-najjar, I am working in Economic Development and =
Foreign Contract payment Operations Department, in the Central Bank of =
Iraq<BR>
(CBI).<BR>
<BR>
My aim of writing you is to seek for your kindness assistance to allow =
me quickly transfer the sum of US$15.million dollars, into your =
account.<BR>
<BR>
It will interest you to know how this huge sum amount of funds came =
about.<BR>
<BR>
About two days before the United State and British, bombing began, =
Saddam Hussein, ordered his youngest son, Qusay, to remove the sum of =
US$1.billion (=A3640 million) from the Central Bank of Iraq (CBI) The =
cash which was<BR>
loadedon to three lorries.<BR>
<BR>
That memorable day Qusay and a senior aide to the former president =
Saddam Hussein delivered the instruction in person to the =
bank\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\=

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s governor of the Central Bank of Iraq (CBI). And =
the money was removed without proper<BR>
official documentations. The money was not debited. It was just remove =
from the foreign reserve vault. This illegal withdrawer created =
opportunity for our staffs working in the foreign payments department. =
We hastingly<BR>

ourselves working in the department, five in number. My share was =
US$15.million,<BR>

reserved for expenses 80% will be kept for your account for me. Note =

responsible<BR>
for removing the funds.<BR>
