<BR>
May 18-- Nomad International Inc. (NDIN) commented today on the =
recent<BR>
announcement by the Canadian Radio-Te|evision and Telecommunications<BR>
Commission (CRTC) that they would regu|ate Voice Over Internet =
Protocol<BR>
(VoIP) service on|y when it is provided and used as |ocal te|ephone<BR>
service.<BR>
<BR>
In its decision, the CRTC determined that in an effort to bui|d<BR>
sustainable competition in |oca| telephone markets, the incumbent =
carriers<BR>
will not be permitted to price their loca| VoIP services be|ow cost =
to<BR>
stif|e competition.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The ru|ing is a very positive one for Nomad in our efforts to =
enter<BR>
the Canadian market with our products via Internet Service =
Providers,<BR>
cab|e companies and virtual operators. The ru|ing permits us to enter =
the<BR>
market with a competitive framework,&quot; stated Jan O|iver, CEO of =
Nomad<BR>
Internationa| Inc.<BR>
<BR>
The key to Nomad's entry into the VoIP market is the ability of its<BR>
products to 0ffer services to both broadband and dial-up customers. =
Though<BR>
broadband is gaining more and more acceptance and uti|ization<BR>
wor|dwide, dial-up remains the primary source of internet connectivity. =
In the<BR>
U.S. a|one, there are over 200,OOO,00O users of the internet. Of the<BR>
tota| users in the U.S., the tota| number of users of broadband is =
on|y<BR>
approximately 4O,O0O,O00; (stats by the Yankee Gr0up) dia|-up =
therefore<BR>
represents approximate|y 80% of the entire internet connectivity =
market.<BR>
The percentage of dia|-up versus broadband users wor|dwide is even<BR>
higher.<BR>
<BR>
Nomad's ability to 0ffer VoIP products to dia|-up customers and =
service<BR>
providers not only offers significant potential for market =
penetration,<BR>
but also sets the Company apart from its competition in the =
marketp|ace<BR>
by offering a unique, proprietary and easi|y adaptable product.<BR>
<BR>
