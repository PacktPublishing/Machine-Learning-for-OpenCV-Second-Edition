DEAR SIR/MADAM,<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=
nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=
bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ( RE: TRANSFER OF ($125,000.000.00 =

nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=
bsp;&nbsp; ONE HUNDRED &amp; TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS<BR>
<BR>
I want to transfer ($125,000.000.00 USD) One Hundred &amp; Twenty five =
million<BR>
United States Dollars&nbsp; from a Prime Bank here in South Africa to an =
oversea<BR>
account. First, I must solicit your strictest confidence in this<BR>
transaction. This is by virtue of it's nature as being utterly =
confidential.<BR>
I am sure and have confidence of your ability and reliability to =
prosecute a<BR>
transaction of this great magnitude. I solicit your assistance to enable =
us<BR>
transfer the said amount into your safe&nbsp; account for unward =
investment.You<BR>
can either provide us with an existing account or to set up a new =
Bank<BR>
account immediately to receive this money, even&nbsp; an empty a/c can =
serve to<BR>
receive this money, as long as you will remain honest to me till the end =
of<BR>
this important business trusting in you and believing&nbsp; that you =
will never<BR>
let me down either now or in future.<BR>
<BR>
I am the personal account officer to the great late INDUSTRIALIST who =
has an<BR>
account in one of the top banks here in South Africa. The account was =
opened<BR>
in 1998 and he died in 2003 without a written or oral WILL and since =
2003<BR>
nobody has operated on this account again hence the money is floating =
and if<BR>
I do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for =
nothing.<BR>
<BR>
The owner of this account is a foreigner and no other person knows =
about<BR>
this account or anything concerning it, the account has no other =
beneficiary<BR>
and until his death he was the manager of the company.My =
investigation<BR>
through the National immigration department proved to me as well that he =
was<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; single as at the time of his entry into the Republic of =
South Africa. The<BR>
amount in this account is USD$125 Million ( One Hundred &amp; Twenty =
five<BR>
Million United States Dollars ) only.<BR>
<BR>
As a matter of fact, I have decided to transfer this fund abroad for<BR>
investment.&nbsp; Your assistance as a foreigner is necessary because =
the<BR>
management of the bank&nbsp; will welcome any foreigner who has =
correct<BR>
information to this account which I&nbsp; will give to you immediately, =
if you<BR>
are interested to do this business with me.There is no risk in this<BR>
business,With my position&nbsp; and my personal contact&nbsp; with the =
manager of the<BR>
bank, the money can be transferred to any account you&nbsp; can provide =
with<BR>
assurance that this money will be intact pending our physical&nbsp; =
arrival in<BR>
your country for sharing.<BR>
<BR>
We will start the first transfer with Twenty five million =
[$25,000.000].<BR>
Upon successful transfer without any disappointment&nbsp; from your =
side, we<BR>
shall re-apply for the&nbsp; payment of the remaining&nbsp; balance of =
$100 Million to<BR>
your account. I am only&nbsp; contacting you as a foreigner because this =
money<BR>
can not be approved to a local&nbsp; person here,&nbsp; but can only be =
approved to<BR>
any foreigner&nbsp; who has the correct&nbsp; information of the account =
which I will<BR>
provide for you.<BR>
<BR>
So you should provide me with your correct account detail where you =
will<BR>
like the fund to be transferred or you can set up a new account for =
the<BR>
transfer&nbsp; even an empty account is ok. At the conclussion of the =
transfer<BR>
you will take 35%,5% will be for any expenses both parties incurred in =
the<BR>
process of this business and the remaining 60% will be for me. As soon =
as I<BR>
hear from you and upon your strong assurance that you will not let me =
down<BR>
once the fund goes into your account I will then start the processing of =
the<BR>
transfer of&nbsp; the fund to your account without further delay.<BR>
<BR>
Send the Information as I stated below.<BR>
<BR>
Bank Name:.............<BR>
Bank Address:..........<BR>
A/C Number:...........<BR>
A/C Name:............<BR>
Swift Code:.........<BR>
<BR>
Contact me urgently via email for further details.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks.<BR>
<BR>
Yours Faithfully,<BR>
Mr.Kevin Hopkins.<BR>
