to Launch &quot;Rudy Flying Colors&quot; Beverage for Kids<BR>

Rudy Flying Colors(TM) to Be Positioned as a Healthy Alternative =
Beverage<BR>
to Combat Childhood Obesity and Diabetes<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
NEWPORT BEACH, CA--(MARKET WIRE)--Aug 19, 2005 --<BR>
Pacific Peak Investments (OTC BB:PPKI.OB - News) announced today<BR>
that one of its portfolio companies, EON Beverage Group, Inc.,<BR>
in conjunction with Notre Dame legend Rudy Ruettiger, will launch<BR>
&quot;RUDY FLYING COLORS&quot; beverage. Rudy Flying Colors(TM) is being =
targeted<BR>
to elementary school children due to its proprietary formula<BR>
of high nutrition and low sugar content.<BR>
<BR>
The announcement on Rudy Flying Colors comes after many politicians,<BR>
celebrities and various health experts have voiced grave concerns<BR>
about the increase of obesity and diabetes in America's youth.<BR>
In a press release dated May 3, 2005, The American Heart Foundation<BR>
and former President Bill Clinton announced plans &quot;to join =
forces<BR>
to create a new generation of healthy Americans by addressing one<BR>
of the nations's leading public health threats - childhood =
obesity.&quot;<BR>
In an article titled &quot;How to Fix School Lunches&quot;<BR>
in the August 8, 2005 issue of Time, the magazine discussed how<BR>
&quot;the soda and candy in the vending machines have been replaced<BR>
by juice and jerky.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Rudy Ruettiger, the inspiration behind the highly successful<BR>
and inspirational TriStar Pictures movie &quot;Rudy&quot; stated,<BR>
&quot;While the trend to juice (versus soda) in the vending machines<BR>
is a step in the right direction in terms of nutrition,<BR>
it still does not alleviate the high sugar content that is in many =
cases<BR>
as high, if not higher, in juices as it is in soda. &quot;Rudy Flying =
Colors&quot;<BR>
unique formula will address both nutritional needs as well as sugar =
content.<BR>
This formula will make Rudy Flying Colors the ultimate<BR>
healthy beverage for children. I completely agree with Bill Clinton,<BR>
others in the media and the pediatrics community<BR>
that we must start taking steps to ensure a healthier diet<BR>
for our children now! Diabetes and obesity among our children<BR>
is growing at a truly alarming rate.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Rudy added, &quot;I am hopeful that the mantra &quot;Flying Colors&quot; =
will become<BR>
an inspiration for children all around America. We want kids<BR>
to pass through life with flying colors, whether it is in academics,<BR>
sports or their health. I have also spoken about how &quot;it all =
starts<BR>
with a dream&quot; and to &quot;never quit&quot; and I believe that when =
it comes<BR>
to the health of our children, none of us can afford to quit!&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Rudy Flying Colors, which will be produced in multiple flavors,<BR>
will be available at retail stores starting in the 4th quarter of =
2005.<BR>
In addition to placement in schools, EON Beverage will target<BR>
mass-market retailers such as Wal-Mart to maximize the accessibility<BR>
of the beverage to parents looking for a healthy alternative<BR>
for their children.<BR>
<BR>
Success in penetrating this niche market will result<BR>
in mainstream retailers marketing Island Tribe products to the huge,<BR>
trendy teen market.&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
Pacific Peaks portfolio-of-companies have excellent growth prospects<BR>
and each one could become a stand-alone ppublicly traded company.<BR>
If that happens, PPKIs investments could explode in value,<BR>
providing early investors with terrific gains. Read all recent news<BR>
on PPKi and you will most certainly agree that,<BR>
<BR>
This is a company to watch closely starting Monday!<BR>
