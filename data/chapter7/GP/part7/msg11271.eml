amenities,social recreational activities in urban and rural areas,This =
programm includes assistance to deprived Local communities and to =
co-ordinate projects and development at the national level, Furthermore, =
from this projects we have been able to secure some reasonable amount of =

These approved fund is now packaged and despatched through a security =
company for onward delivery to its final destination. These fund are =
first deposited into a vault security before we arrange for its movement =
to Europe through diplomatic channel using decoy purporting that the =
fund belongs to an expatriate/company , as we are Government officiale =
,we are not allowed to operate/own foreign bank account,Hence we need =
you to stand as the beneficiary and claim the fund on our behalf from =
the security company.<BR>

high intergrity /dignity and one with conscience who will claim this =
fund on our behalf as the beneficiary,and we have agreed to give you 25% =
of the total sum as commission for your assistance/effort. And 5% will =
