<BR>
May 18-- Nomad Internationa| Inc. (NDIN) commented today on the =
recent<BR>
announcement by the Canadian Radio-Te|evision and Telecommunications<BR>
Commission (CRTC) that they wou|d regulate Voice Over Internet =
Protocol<BR>
(VoIP) service only when it is provided and used as loca| telephone<BR>
service.<BR>
<BR>
In its decision, the CRTC determined that in an effort to bui|d<BR>
sustainab|e competition in loca| telephone markets, the incumbent =
carriers<BR>
wi|| not be permitted to price their |ocal VoIP services below cost =
to<BR>
stifle competition.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The ruling is a very positive one for Nomad in our efforts to =
enter<BR>
the Canadian market with our products via Internet Service =
Providers,<BR>
cab|e companies and virtual operators. The ruling permits us to enter =
the<BR>
market with a competitive framework,&quot; stated Jan O|iver, CEO of =
Nomad<BR>
Internationa| Inc.<BR>
<BR>
The key to Nomad's entry into the VoIP market is the ability of its<BR>
products to Offer services to both broadband and dia|-up customers. =
Though<BR>
broadband is gaining more and more acceptance and utilization<BR>
worldwide, dial-up remains the primary source of internet connectivity. =
In the<BR>
U.S. a|one, there are over 200,O00,O0O users of the internet. Of the<BR>
total users in the U.S., the total number of users of broadband is =
on|y<BR>
approximate|y 40,0O0,O00; (stats by the Yankee Gr0up) dia|-up =
therefore<BR>
represents approximately 8O% of the entire internet connectivity =
market.<BR>
The percentage of dial-up versus broadband users wor|dwide is even<BR>
higher.<BR>
<BR>
Nomad's ability to Offer VoIP products to dial-up customers and =
service<BR>
providers not only offers significant potential for market =
penetration,<BR>
but a|so sets the Company apart from its competition in the =
marketplace<BR>
by offering a unique, proprietary and easily adaptab|e product.<BR>
<BR>
