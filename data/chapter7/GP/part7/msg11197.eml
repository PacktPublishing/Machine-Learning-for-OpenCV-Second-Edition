Mr. Ron McIntyre, President of Vocalscape commented, &quot;Providing =
and<BR>
end-to-end solution that easily integrates with existing telephony<BR>
infrastructure will not only hasten the commercialization of VoIP =

lowers the barrier to entry for emerging ITSPs and Telecommunication<BR>
companies. Over the past year, we have had several requests for a<BR>
complete solution and we are currently running these systems in<BR>
Greece<BR>
and Canada and are negotiating a launch of the solution in the Far<BR>
