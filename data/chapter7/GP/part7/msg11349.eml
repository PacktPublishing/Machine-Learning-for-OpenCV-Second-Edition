      <P>PLANO, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 20, 2004--Austin Medical =
Technologies, Inc. (Pink Sheets:AMTK - News), dba eyeDirecti, announces =
the appointment of Denice Espinosa, CRNA to the company Board of =
Advisors. <br>
        <br>
        Denice Espinosa, CRNA is the Director of Surgery and Refractive =
Centers/Anesthesia for Berkeley Eye Center in Houston and oversees all =
surgical services provided in the Caplan Surgery Center and =
Berkeley-Caplan Laser Centers, as well as, all ophthalmic surgical =
services provided by Berkeley Eye Center surgeons in five outlying =
ambulatory surgery centers/hospitals. Ms. Espinosa is responsible for =
system analysis of the surgical process, to include time and cost =
analysis for surgery and laser center caseloads. She has been a customer =
of eyeDirecti for over three years, using daypacks with great savings =
and success.=20
      <p>Denice Espinosa states, &quot;I am very excited to become a =
part of such a dynamic group of individuals. I have been a customer of =
eyeDirecti for over three years and the company has shown me time after =
time that the value of flexibility and reliability is immeasurable. The =
cost savings that the custom day-packs(TM) have offered for Berkeley Eye =
Center through the products and the reduction of employee time spent in =
preparation for surgery have been substantial enough to keep Berkeley =
Eye Center/Caplan Surgery Center coming back for more business. I look =
forward to the opportunity to contribute to the growth of eyeDirecti by =
providing insight into processes that influence the success of surgery =
and laser centers.&quot;</p>
