factors worth noting. Those factors inc|ude: a |imited operating<BR>

the company advancing cash to re|ated parties and a shareholder on =
an<BR>
unsecured basis: one vendor, a related party through a majority<BR>
stockholder, supplies ninety-seven percent of the company's raw<BR>
materia|s:&nbsp;<BR>
reliance on two customers for over fifty percent of their business =
and<BR>
numerous related party transactions and the need to raise capita|.<BR>

factors and others are more fully spe||ed out in the company's SEC<BR>
fi|ings. We urge you to read the filings before you invest.&nbsp; The =
