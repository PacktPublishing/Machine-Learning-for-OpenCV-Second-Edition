Like Momentum..<BR>
<BR>
Breaking News!!<BR>
<BR>
Triton American Energy Corp. (TRAE) is pleased to announce after one =
full year of operations, financial audits are now underway. Audits are =
anticipated to be completed by August 1st and will reflect fiscal year =
2004 to 2005 results.<BR>
<BR>
Once audits are completed, Triton American Energy will file to move to a =
new, more liquid exchange and begin presenting their company to =
stockbrokers through out the country.<BR>
<BR>
President and CEO, Louis Guidry states &quot;We are now entering the =
stage where our acquisitions are driving in immediate residual revenues =
for our company. With the completion of our audits, investors will have =
the 0pp0rtunity to watch our growth on a quarter to quarter and year =
over year basis.&quot; Mr. Guidry continued to state &quot;We value our =
shareholders and look forward to opening our books and allowing =
investors to experience the true meaning of residual revenue and income =
growth of a proven energy company.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Triton American Energy Corp. (TRAE) of Houston, TX., is pleased to =
announce they are now producing approximately 850,000 cubic feet of gas =
per day from 2 wells within the Dyersdale North Field. These wells have =
a life expectancy of 10 years. Currently, Triton American Energy owns 8 =
wells within these fields. These wells hold estimated reserves of 3 =
billion cubic feet of gas and 345,000 barrels of oil. Triton American =
Energy also owns wells within Zapata County which have proven reserves =
and are pulling in 1.2 billion cubic feet of gas per day.<BR>
<BR>
This current production and strong forecast comes on the heels of the =
Energy Information Administration (EIA) projecting gas prices to remain =
at record levels through 2006. Triton American Energy anticipates high =
gas prices will fuel the companies continued month over month and year =
over year record revenue growth. According to the EIA &quot;the primary =
factor behind the price increases is crude oil costs. High world oil =
demand will continue to support crude oil prices and increasee =
competition for gasoline imports&quot;. Triton American Energy and its =
investors benefit from the rising oil and gas prices.<BR>
<BR>
President and CEO, Louis Guidry stated &quot;We are very excited about =
the direction of where our company is headed. In the last 10 months we =
have acquired over 28 oil and gas wells which have proven reserves. As =
oil prices continue to fuel the rise of gas prices, we will seek to take =
full advantage of our gas wells within Zapata County and the Dyersdale =
North Field.&quot; Mr. Guidry continued to state, &quot;Our goal is to =
have all 28 gas and oil wells online in less then one year, while =
acquiring additional abandon wells. We are also very confident in =
achieving the status of being a multi-million dollar company with strong =
profit margins by the second quarter of 2006. We are well on our way to =
reaching this milestone and will be preparing audited financials for our =
investors this summer&quot;.<BR>

About Triton American Energy Corporation:<BR>
<BR>
Triton American Energy is an independent crude oil and natural gas and =
oil exploration and production company based in Houston, Texas. The =
Company's business plan is structured to take advantage of today's =
rising energy cost, while reducing as much financial risk as possible. =
Tritons niche or specialty are the small to moderate operations (usually =
1-50 well projects). These wells can be worth hundreds of millions of =
dollars in revenue but require more hands-on attention then the major =
producers are willing to give.<BR>
