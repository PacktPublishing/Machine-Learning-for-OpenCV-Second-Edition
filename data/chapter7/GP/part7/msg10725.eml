The strong performance in the second quarter of 2005 compared to the =
same period<BR>
in 2004 was primarily due to the increase in number of TV subscribers, =
sales of Pay-TV<BR>
and revenues from commercial accounts of digitalization of television =
signals.<BR>
Furthermore, the company experienced significant growth in the second =
quarter of 2005<BR>
as compared to the first quarter of 2005.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We are very delighted with our strong performance in the second =
quarter of 2005.<BR>
These results confirm our efforts in migration of the television =
broadcasting system<BR>
and the operations of Pay-TV services in Nanhai, China. In addition, the =
per-subscriber<BR>
revenue has increased significantly,&quot; said Mr. Daniel Ng, Chairman =
and CEO<BR>
of China Digital Media Corporation. &quot;We anticipate continued strong =
results<BR>
from our core business. Our recent investments and upcoming =
acquisitions<BR>
could further contribute considerably in our growth during the second =
half of 2005,&quot;<BR>
