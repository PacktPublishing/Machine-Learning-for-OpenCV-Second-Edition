<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>There is this free date site filled with a bunch of =
sexoholics.<BR>
<BR>
No flowers, no walk on the beach, just meet up for sex :)<BR>
<BR>
There are also some people who want serious relationships though<BR>
So if you want a long-termer, or a one-nighter, you got it ;)<BR>
<BR>
Whatever floats your boat pretty much!<BR>
