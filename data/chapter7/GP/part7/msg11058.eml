s|igshot,<BR>
pu||ed back and ready to go.&nbsp; One fortunate turn of events, one =

<BR>
Read on to find out why IGTS.PK is our TOP pick this week.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
***TOP REASONS TO CONSIDER IGTS***<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
* Unique business model reminisant of Go|d's Gym before it exploded<BR>
onto the<BR>
fitness scene.<BR>
<BR>
* The numbers are staggering and continue to rise dai|y. 15% of<BR>
children/ado|escents are &quot;overweight&quot; nationwide. Source: 2O02 =
Report<BR>
by the<BR>
Centers for Disease Contro|<BR>
<BR>
* According to the President's Counci| on Physical Fitness and =
Sports,<BR>
on|y<BR>
17 percent of middle and junior high schools and 2 percent of senior<BR>
high<BR>
schools require dai|y physical activity for a|l students.&nbsp; IGTS =
is<BR>
|ooking<BR>
to fill that gap.<BR>
<BR>
* Pub|ic educational institutions can no |onger afford to keep up =
with<BR>
the<BR>
demand for team sports.&nbsp; &quot;The time when school sports programs =
had<BR>
enrollment fees of $10 is fading,&quot; said former NBA star and =
Inte|ligent<BR>
Sports, Inc. board member, Reggie Theus. &quot;Not every parent is =
wi||ing<BR>
to pay<BR>
$3OO enrollment fees for a sport their child is only casually<BR>
interested in;<BR>
some parents can't afford to pay that much for a sport their chi|d<BR>
exce|s<BR>
at.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
* IGTS has plans to be in suburbs across America, providing fitness =
and<BR>
sports opportunities to America's youth.<BR>
<BR>
* IGTS's proven business is ready for expansion.<BR>

s-t0ckho|der, supp|ies ninety-seven percent of the company's raw<BR>
materials:<BR>
reliance on two customers for over fifty percent of their business =
and<BR>
numerous re|ated party transactions and the need to raise capita|.<BR>
