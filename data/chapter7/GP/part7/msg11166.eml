<BR>Besides pride, loyalty, discipline, heart, and mind, confidence is =
the key to all the locks.


Rigid, the skeleton of habit alone upholds the human frame.
I'm a great believer in luck, and I find the harder I work, the more I =
have of it.<BR>Our friends interpret the world and ourselves to us, if =
we take them tenderly and truly.



<br><br>Biography should be written by an acute enemy.
<BR>If New York is the Big Apple, tonight Hollywood is the Big =
Nipple.=0D



<br>Retail is detail.
<BR><BR>I had a lot of experience with people smarter than I am.

<BR>Talk to a man about himself and he will listen for hours.


<BR>Speak of me as I am. Nothing extenuate, nor set down aught in =
malice.

<BR><BR>I would like to find a stew that will give me heartburn =
immediately, instead of at three o clock in the morning.Love is the =
wisdom of the fool and the folly of the wise.<BR><BR>Where love is =
concerned, too much is not even enough.



<br>Come children, let us shut up the box and the puppets, for our play =
is played out.



<br><br>He who cures a disease may be the skillfullest, but he that =
prevents it is the safest physician.
Better belly burst than good liquor be lost.<BR><BR>My appointed work is =
to awaken the divine nature that is within.<br>Two million years from =
now the scientists can start a row by claming that the creatures of that =
period descended from us.
