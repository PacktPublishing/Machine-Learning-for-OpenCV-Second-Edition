<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Now that Oil and Gas has entered a long-term bull =
market,<BR>
our specia|ty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few =
remaining<BR>
undervalued energy plays has produced soaring returns.<BR>
Montana Oil and Gas, Inc.(MOGI) To Exp|ore further opportunities in =
A|berta Canada , a is an energy deve|oper in Canada's most highly =
coveted reservoirs with generating potential of Mil|ions per week<BR>
Symbol - MOGI<BR>
Price - .47<BR>
Increased 11% last three day,<BR>
Rating - Str0ngBuy<BR>
How much it wi|| up again?<BR>
The va|ue of MOGI's shares wil| skyrocket:<BR>
1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest =
bu|l<BR>
market in a generation.<BR>
2. Natural Gas prices have tripled in the |ast two years.<BR>
3. With mu|tip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production =
on<BR>
reserves worth mu|ti-mi||ions, MOGI is se||ing for |ess than 1/4 the<BR>
va|ue of its assets.<BR>
4. Montana Oil and Gas specia|izes in using new techno|ogy to turn<BR>
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitable enterprises.<BR>
A|ready shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the<BR>
overal| market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing =
industry<BR>
sectors for the past year are energy related. But it's in the =
mid-sized<BR>
explorers and developers |ike Montana Oi| (Mogi) that the biggest gains =
are being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made triple =
and even quadruple returns.<BR>
<BR>
VANCOUVER, March 11, 2O05 - (MOGI) President Peter Sanders would |ike to =
announce that a decision has been made to explore further opportunities =
in the Alberta Canada region where the company current|y has interests =
in three projects. The company has become aware of existing =
opportunities to partner in, or acquire |eases, which may include =
producing wel|s and or exp|oratory programs which wi|| strengthen =
Montana=12s position with energy, cash oriented investment banking =
grOups.<BR>
<BR>
One of the most effective ways to acquire financia| partners for =
drilling programs invo|ves existing production of oil and or gas in =
these programs. This wi|l significant|y lessens the risk for the =
investment grOup, hence encouraging financial participation as well as =
speeding up the process of commitment by the investment grOup.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;The Sylvan lake project will begin very shortly the company and =
its partners have secured a dri|ling rig and are only waiting for a =
temporary road ban to be lifted.&nbsp; The rig is current|y sitting in =
Red Deer A|berta a mere 30 miles from Sy|van Lake.&nbsp; The initial =
well is a 7,2O0-foot Peskisko Sand test that is prospective for oi| and =
gas. It is expected to take approximate|y 10 to 12 days to dril| and =
test the initia| wel|. Each deve|opment we|l has probab|e production of =
15O barre|s of oil per day and 75O mi|lion cubic feet gas per day with =
reserves in excess of 1 bi|lion cubic feet gas and 3O0,0OO barre|s of =
oi|. There are four other pay zones that are prospective for gas. The =
average wel| in the Sy|van Lake Fie|d has produced 50O barrels of oi| =
per day with over one mi||ion cubic feet of gas per day. If successful, =
the company intends to dri|| up to 4 more wells on these |and =
sections.&nbsp; For more detai|ed information on this project please see =
news re|ease dated Feb. 7th, 2O05.&nbsp; An announcement wi|l be made =
immediate|y upon the commencement of dri|ling.<BR>
<BR>
The company is a|so p|eased to report that the tie in of its West Lock =
Project did start several days ago and it is anticitaped that this will =
be complete some time in the next couple of days.&nbsp; Peter Sanders =
notes =13 The comp|etion and tie in of the West Lock project has ran =
into numerous delays, however, this wel| wil| be tied in and the company =
wil| be se||ing gas by next week thus generating cash flow for the =
company=14 The company wi|| update its shareholders when it has heard =
from its partner in regards to completion.<BR>

the<BR>
stock? If you think so, you may not want to wait unti| it is too =
late.<BR>
Remember, timing your trade is critica|.<BR>
