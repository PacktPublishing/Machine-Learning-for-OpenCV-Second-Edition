<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>I don't know whether other people who suffer from =
chronic diseases have the<BR>
same feeling. To recieve a refi11 seems to take a greater amount of =
time<BR>
than it should. And the prices on taablets are scary. My experience =
proved<BR>
so. The prices on r'xdrugs are really reduced from other stores. Thank =
you<BR>
for providing this wonderful arrangement. -- Mark J. in SD<BR>
It is quick and convenient way for you to purchase rxmeds at our<BR>
rxdrug-site. Our company provides a wide variety of r!xdrugs at the<BR>
unsurpassed prices.<BR>

good.&quot; If we<BR>
suffer wrongfully, if we are misunderstood or despised, we must think of =
Him<BR>
who was pure and holy, and who prayed for those who nailed Him to the =
cross,<BR>
&quot;Father forgive them, for they know not what they do.&quot;<BR>
