<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Hello,<BR>
<BR>
I wanted to inform you that I have launched my new website,&nbsp; where =
I can tell you a little bit about how I brought beauty back into my =
hair.<BR>
<BR>
Harsh chemicals, swimming, and exposure to the sun left my hair dry, =
damaged, and destroyed. I felt the need for a product to restore its =
brilliance, but could not find anything on the market that was both =
natural and effective.<BR>
During my young adulthood, I traveled as a swim athlete throughout =
Europe and gathered natural beauty remedies. I combined these pure =
ingredients and developed a unique formulation that became what we know =
today as Nana Essence.<BR>
<BR>
I wanted to share my products with others so that they could too benefit =
from the natural remedies found in Nana Essence. Now I want you to try =
my products... you will not regret it!<BR>
<BR>

business.<BR>
