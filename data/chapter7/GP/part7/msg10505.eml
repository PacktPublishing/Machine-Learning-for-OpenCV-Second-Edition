AND CONFIDENTIAL<BR>
<BR>
Dear Sir,<BR>
<BR>
Before I start, I must first apologize for this unsolicited mail to you. =
I<BR>
am aware that this is certainly an unconventional approach to =
establishing a<BR>
relationship, but you will realize the need for my action.&nbsp; Please, =
I will<BR>
like to know your interest on this transaction. Actually, your contact =
was<BR>
via&nbsp; S.A.I.I.E.B.(South African International Internet Exchange =
Bureau) here<BR>
in Johannesburg Chamber of Commerce and Industry, while I was searching =
for<BR>
a reputable confidential and honest person to do this business =
together.<BR>
<BR>
FULL UNDERSTANDING<BR>
<BR>
I am Mrs Janet Omaha the wife of late Mr sipho Omaha&nbsp; from =
Zimbabwe. My<BR>
husband was among the rich black farmers murdered in cold blood in =
Zimbabwe<BR>
by war veterans of President ROBERT MUGABE. However,the number of =
farmers<BR>
killed in Zimbabwe over the new land act introduced by president do not =
give<BR>
any concern. My main aim of contacting you is to assist me in =
transfering<BR>
the sum of $12,000,000 (Twelve million&nbsp; US Dollars )Into your =
nominated<BR>
oversea account,this money was given to my husband by president Mugabe =
when<BR>
they were still in good terms for investement purposes. My husband =
deposited<BR>
this money in a security company in johannesburg here in South Africa as =
if<BR>
he&nbsp; foresaw the looming blow of his death.My late husband deposited =
the said<BR>
funds as family treasure in order to aviod seizure since South =
Africa,have<BR>
almost the same land laws with Zimbabwe presently. I am residing in =
South<BR>
Africa with my son as asylum seekers,based on our present status we =
are<BR>
deprived of some&nbsp; financial rights of banking activities. =
Moreover,this<BR>
money is the only thing my late husband left for us as such the entire =
life<BR>
of my family depends on this money coupled with the responsibilities =
rested<BR>
on me,I will be willing to go into partnership on any lucrative business =
you<BR>
will suggest in your country.<BR>
<BR>
At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 35% of the =
total<BR>
amount, 60% will be for me, and while 5% will be for expenses both =
parties<BR>
might have incurred during the process of transferring this fund. =
Finally,<BR>
please kindly furnish me with any of your private phone and fax numbers =
for<BR>
more information and the immediate step to be followed and also =
further<BR>
information about yourself is necessary for i can not play on =
this.&nbsp; You can<BR>
as well read more about the crises in my country and about this =
situation on<BR>
