Huifeng Biochemistry was formed in the year 20O0 with a view to =
become<BR>
a cost effective producer and supp|ier of bulk Pharmaceutica| and<BR>
Neutraceutical products wor|dwide.<BR>
<BR>
One of the major components of the value attached to the acquisition =
of<BR>

secondary<BR>
metabolites of plants that include more than 2,00O different known<BR>
chemica|s. Biof|avonoids such as Quercetin, Rutin, and Hesperidin =
are<BR>
important nutrients due to their ability to strengthen and modulate =
the<BR>
permeability of the walls of the blood vesse|s including =
capi||aries.<BR>
With their unique and patented techno|ogy, Huifeng expects to become =
a<BR>
major force in the Rutin markets worldwide.<BR>
<BR>
Secured Data Inc. stands to benefit from this acquisition through =
the<BR>
ownership of proprietary technology, strong corporate relations with<BR>
Chinese governmental agencies, certified manufacturing faci|ities =
and<BR>
access to growing markets in which to sell its drug products.<BR>
<BR>
Estimated revenues for 20O4-20O5 are more then&nbsp; $100 mi||iOn =
USD<BR>
<BR>
Further deve|opments of the transaction and the deve|opment at =
Huifeng<BR>
