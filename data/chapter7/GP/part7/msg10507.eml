<P><FONT SIZE=2>FROM: Angela Magoora.<BR>
<BR>
Dear friend,<BR>
<BR>
You may be surprised to receive this letter from me<BR>
since you do not know<BR>
me personally. I am Angela Magoora, the first daughter of<BR>
Madogo Magoora, the<BR>
most popular black farmer in Zimbabwe who was murdered<BR>
in the land dispute<BR>
in my country. I got your contact through network<BR>
online hence decided to write you.<BR>
<BR>
Before the death of my father, he had taken me to<BR>
Johannesburg to deposit<BR>
the sum of USD16.5 million (Sixteen&nbsp; million five<BR>
hundred thousand United<BR>
States dollars), in one of the private security<BR>
company, as he foresaw thelooming danger in Zimbabwe this money<BR>
was deposited in a box as gem stones<BR>
to avoid much demurrage from security company. This<BR>
amount was meant for the purchase of new machines<BR>
and chemicals for the Farms and establishment<BR>
of new farms in Swizerland. This land problem came when<BR>
Zimbabwe President Mr. Robert Mugabe introduced a<BR>
new Land Act Reform wholly affecting the<BR>
rich white farmers and some few black farmers, and<BR>
this resulted to thekilling and mob action by Zimbabwean<BR>
war veterans and some lunatics in the<BR>
society. In fact a lot of people were killed because<BR>
of this Land reform<BR>
Act for which my father was one of the victims.<BR>
<BR>
It is against this background that I and my family<BR>
fled Zimbabwe to South<BR>
Africa for fear of our lives. After which I traveled<BR>
to the Netherlands<BR>
and I am currently staying in the Netherlands where I<BR>
am seeking political<BR>
asylum and more so have decided to transfer my<BR>
father&#8217;s money to a more<BR>
reliable foreign account. Since the law of Netherlands<BR>
prohibits a refugee<BR>
(asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be<BR>
involved in any financial<BR>
transaction throughout the<BR>
territorial zone of Netherlands. As the eldest daughter of<BR>
my father, I am saddled<BR>
with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign<BR>
account where this<BR>
money could be transferred without the knowledge of my<BR>
government who are<BR>
meant on taking everything we have got. The South<BR>
African government seems to be playing along with<BR>
them.<BR>
<BR>
I am faced with the dilemma of moving this amount of<BR>
money out of South<BR>
Africa for fear of going through the same experience<BR>
in future. Both countries<BR>
have similar political history. As a business woman, I<BR>
am seeking for a partner<BR>
who I have to entrust my future and that of my family<BR>
in his hands, I must<BR>
let you know that this transaction is risk free. If<BR>
you accept to assist<BR>
me and my family, all I want you to do for me, is to<BR>
make arrangements with<BR>
the security company to clear the Consignment (funds)<BR>
here in the Netherlands,<BR>
because the consignment is with the security company<BR>
now in the netherlands.But<BR>
before then all modalities will have to be put in<BR>
place like change of ownership<BR>
to the consignment and more importantly this money I<BR>
intend to use for investment.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I have two options for you. Firstly you can choose to<BR>
have certain percentage<BR>
of the money for nominating your account for this<BR>
transaction. Or you can<BR>
go into partnership with me for the proper profitable<BR>
investment of the<BR>
money in your country. Which ever the option you want,<BR>
feel free to notify me. I have also mapped out 5%<BR>
of this money for all kinds of expenses incurred<BR>
in the process of this transaction.<BR>
<BR>
If you do not prefer a partnership I am willing to<BR>
give you 10% of the money<BR>
while the remaining 85% will be for my investment in<BR>
your country. Contact<BR>
me through my confidential email<BR>
address:angela45@walla.com while<BR>
I implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy<BR>
required in this transaction<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Thanks, GOD BLESS YOU<BR>
<BR>
Yours Faithfully,<BR>
Angela Magoora<BR>
