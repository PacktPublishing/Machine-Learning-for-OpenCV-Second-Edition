LONDON -- (AP WorldStream via COMTEX) -- The U.S. dollar has fallen to =
an all-time low against the Euro.&nbsp; The euro hit a new<BR>
<BR>
high of US $1.3646, exceeding the record US $1.3643 set in European =
trading.&nbsp; Brokers say there is nothing to tempt investors<BR>
<BR>
to buy the dollar, which has suffered in recent weeks over fears about =
the size of the U.S. fiscal and budget deficits.&nbsp; Now<BR>
<BR>
is the time for you to take advantage of the opportunities the Euro has =
to offer.&nbsp; From the Desk of Caitlin Sweeney.<BR>
