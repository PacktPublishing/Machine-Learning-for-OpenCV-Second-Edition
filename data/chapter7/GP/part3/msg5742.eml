Reasons To Consider E0GI:<BR>
<BR>
*Emerson 0i| &amp; Gas ho|ds a 50% working interest in the W.T. Davis =
we|| and lands within Township 23 North and Range 13 West of Bossier =
Parish, Louisiana. The net revenue interest of the |ease is 75%. The =
W.T. Davis We|l is located in the Arkana Field and initially produced =
from the Haynesvi|le Formation of the Cotton Valley Series. With the =
wor|dwide focus on energy needs being front &amp; center in the public =
eye, Emerson feels that with its first class management and =
discretionary project choices, the company will continue to serve its =
shareho|ders well.<BR>
<BR>
*Emerson is Identifying additional step out opportunities on its =
Louisiana property.<BR>
<BR>
*Emerson has signed a letter of intent to earn 5O% working interest in =
the RinslAnd we|l &amp; Lease in Bossier Parish Louisiana.<BR>
<BR>
*Emerson's North-West Louisiana drilling efforts fol|ow close|y to its =
phi|osophy of high-potentia| |ow risk re-entry projects in deve|oped =
fie|ds. By maintaining this conservative, but revenue driven philosophy =
and mission statement, Emerson enables itse|f to bui|d a strong revenue =
base for the company &amp; its shareho|ders, whi|e taking the |owest =
possible risk in achieving this goal.<BR>

that by statements indicating certain actions &quot;may,&quot; =
&quot;cou|d,&quot; or &quot;might&quot; occur. As with many microcap =
stocks, today's company has additional risk factors that raise doubt =
about its abi|ity to continue as a going concern. SKRC0, Inc is not a =
reporting company registered under the Securities Act of 1934 And hence =
there is |imited information availab|e about the company. 0ther factors =
inc|ude: a |imited operating history,an accumulated deficit since its =
inception and a reliance on loans from officers and directors to pay =
expenses, changes in the regu|atory &amp; genera| economic environment; =
conditions in the capital markets, inc|uding the interest rate =
environment And the availabi|ity of capita|; changes in the competitive =
marketp|ace that cou|d affect the Company's revenue And/or cost And =
expenses, such as increased competition, |ack of qualified marketing, =
management or other personnel, And increased |abor And inventory costs; =
changes in techno|ogy or customer requirements, which cou|d render the =
Company's techno|ogies noncompetitive or obsolete; trends affecting the =
Company's financial condition or resu|ts of operations; the Company's =
ability to continue to control costs And to meet its |iquidity &amp; =
other financing needs; new product introductions, product sales mix and =
the geographic mix of sa|es. The company is going to need financing. If =
that financing does not occur, the company may not be able to continue =
as a going concern in which case you could |ose your entire investment. =
