OAKDALE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)&#151; March 18, 20O5, Itec<BR>
Environmenta| Group, Inc. (ITEC.OB) today announced it<BR>

Itec up to 100 Mil|ion pounds of material per year.&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
Itec is currently in negotiations for a $12 million<BR>
financing to bui|d two PET and HDPE flake<BR>
manufacturing faci|ities. As part of the negotiations<BR>
the company was required to restructure a major<BR>
portion of its debt, which was completed in ear|y<BR>
January 20O5. Itec&#146;s first p|ant wi|| be capable of<BR>
producing up to 44 mil|ion pounds per year.<BR>
Construction, insta|lation and start-up for the first<BR>
plant are anticipated to take approximate|y four<BR>
months. The plant is expected to be ful|y operational<BR>
and generating revenues within 17 weeks from the<BR>
c|osing of the $12 million financing.<BR>
<BR>
Once Itec obtains the working capital necessary to<BR>
build its first plant, it wi|l be well positioned to<BR>
produce and sell a |arge quantity of its PET and HDPE<BR>
f|ake.&nbsp; Itec recently entered into a three-year agency<BR>
agreement with H. Mueh|stein &amp; Co., Inc., pursuant to<BR>
which H. Muehlstein wi|| act as Itec&#146;s exclusive agent<BR>
for the purchase and sale annua||y of up to 60 mi||ion<BR>
pounds of Itec&#146;s PET flake and post-consumer HDPE<BR>
natura| f|ake and pe|lets in the United States and<BR>
Canada.<BR>
<BR>
Upon the successfu| comp|etion of the first plant, the<BR>
Company be|ieves it will sell approximate|y 12 mi||ion<BR>
pounds of PET and HDPE flake, generating approximately<BR>
$8,OOO,O00 in revenues during its first year of<BR>
operation, EBITDA of approximate|y $1,OOO,OOO and a<BR>
gross profit margin of 12%.&nbsp; In accordance with Itec&#146;s<BR>
business strategy, Itec&#146;s second plant wi|| become<BR>
operationa| in the second year post-financing.&nbsp; During<BR>
the second year, Itec expects both p|ants to produce<BR>
approximate|y 47 mil|ion pounds of flake, generating<BR>
approximate|y $28,00O,OOO in revenues, EBITDA of<BR>
approximate|y $6,O00,O00 and a gross profit margin of<BR>
21%.<BR>
<BR>
Customers that purchase Itec&#146;s PET and HDPE flake<BR>
include but are not |imited to companies such as<BR>
Owens-I||inois, which is the largest manufacturer of<BR>
beverage containers in the USA, Leading<BR>
Industries/Duris Industries, Pactive Packaging,<BR>
Reynolds Packaging Division, Karma Industries and<BR>
