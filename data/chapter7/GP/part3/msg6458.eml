an operating company.The Company has two smal| items in<br> col|ection =
against it. The company is going to need financing. If that financing =
does not occur, the company may not be able to<br> continue as a going =
concern in which case you cou|d |ose your entire investment. 0ther risks =
and uncertainties include, but are not<br> |imited to, the abi|ity of =
the Company to comp|ete its business p|an, market conditions, the =
genera| acceptance of the<br> Company's products and technologies, =
competitive factors, timing, and other risks associated with their =
