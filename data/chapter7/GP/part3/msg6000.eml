<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Hi I'm Ashley. I am such a cyber geek now. All I do is =
set online, read, chat and I am mostly on my site, updating and =
renovating it all the time. I am currently a collage student. I have =
lots of free time on my hands, so I decided to make a website about my =
life. The best thing about my site is that I finally got my self a =
program to verify age. Dont' worry Its free. I made this so that minors =
won't be able to access my page. I am looking to meet new cyber friend, =
and who knows maybe even more then just friends ;D.<BR>
