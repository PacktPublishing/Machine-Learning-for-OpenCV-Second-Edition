<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>How I Stole Your Election<BR>
by George W. Bush<BR>
<BR>
The first thing I did to steal your election was to make friends with =
ALL the manufacturers and code-verifyers of the Electronic Voting =
Machines.&nbsp; They were really nice, especially Diebold who gave me =
$600,000 for my campaign.&nbsp; Wow, thanks dude!<BR>

Next, I had my attack dog, Karl Rove, convince these companies to either =
alter the vote totals on the central tabulator machines (simple PCs =
running windows using Remote Access Server -- RAS), or reprogram (via a =
downloadable software patch) the voting machines themselves so that they =
would give the advantage to ME!&nbsp; Isn't America great?!?&nbsp; A =
little money and some religious zealotry goes a looooong, loooong =
way.&nbsp; Oh, the religious zealotry thing?&nbsp; That's just a =
cover.&nbsp; I'm not really a Christian -- or at least I don't act like =
one.&nbsp; Anyway, I digress.<BR>

Did you ever hear the media complaining about how inaccurate the exit =
polls were in prior elections?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; That's because they =
basically ARE accurate.&nbsp; But this election, the exit polls showed =
Kerry WAY ahead.&nbsp; No problem.&nbsp; My buddies rigged the machines =
(and all they needed to do was rig it in one state, Ohio, but they took =
care of at least Florida for me too) not only to make me squeak by in =
the important battleground states, like Florida and Ohio, but they also =
made sure that when I did get a state that I was expected to win, the =
margin was HUGE so that my &quot;popular&quot; vote would make it look =
like I had a mandate.<BR>
<BR>
So let's recap how the popular vote thing worked again.&nbsp; Let's say =
we didn't want it to look suspicious by taking states that Kerry really =
would have won (except for Ohio and Florida, gotta take those! heh =
heh).&nbsp; So we let him win there, but in order once again to boost =
the &quot;popular&quot; vote (I put that in quotes because as you know, =
I'm not REALLY popular), we bring my vote tallies RIGHT UP NEXT to =
Kerry's, to jack up the &quot;popular&quot; vote as much as possible, =
even if I didn't win the state.<BR>
<BR>
Then, with states like North Carolina, we know we're going to steal the =
state anyway (at least according to what the exit polls were telling =
everyone.... and according to the long, long lines of new voters were =
telling everyone ... because we all know most of those people were =
voting for Kerry, not the status quo), so we just jack the crap out of =
the vote total to REALLY stuff a crapload of &quot;popular&quot; votes =
in my pocket.&nbsp; You see, this way I can get on the TV and declare =
that I have a &quot;mandate&quot; and that I'm going to &quot;cash =
in&quot; on my political &quot;capital&quot; (which I don't really have =
of course, but we made it look that way).<BR>
<BR>
Here's a nice chart to show you what I mean.&nbsp; Take special note of =
how the electronic voting machine totals compare to the paper ballot =
totals.&nbsp; And see what I mean about North Carolina?<BR>

Look folks, if you really want me out of office, first you're going to =
have to impeach me.&nbsp; But you know what, if you don't have =
verifiable paper trails at the polls like these folks recommend ( <A =
HREF=3D"http://openvotingconsortium.org/">http://openvotingconsortium.org=
/</A> ), and if you don't take these voting machines out of the hands of =
private companies that are aligned with one end of the political =
spectrum, then I'm gonna just continue to hose you (and then my brother =
Jeb will be president too cause we're into this dynasty thing, kind of =
like my buddies the Saudis... ain't it cool?!?).&nbsp; Also, in 2006, =
we're going to steal about five more senate seats, and then we'll have =
the &quot;super-majority&quot;.&nbsp; That means the Democrats can't do =
that confounded fillerbs... fillas.... fillbusters.... CRAP, well, they =
can't get in the darn way any more and we can pass ANY laws we want =
about ANYTHING and put whoever we want on the Supreme court.&nbsp; Ha =
ha, then you're REALLY screwed.&nbsp; So if you don't fix this mess (I =
mean great system) in two years and have a verifiable voting system =
nationwide, America is MINE!!!!! (and Jeb's and my daddy's and Cheney's =
and Rove's... hey, we could even pass a law saying I could be president =
for FOUR MORE YEARS after 2008!&nbsp; That would be SOOO cool!)&nbsp; =
Anyway, I digress once again.<BR>

And that pesky Bev Harris.&nbsp; Man I wish she would go away. If too =
many of you contribute to her cause, I might just get in trouble so =
KNOCK IT OFF!!<BR>

I've said it before and I'll say it again, &quot;Fool me =
once.....&quot;, oh CRAP, I forgot again.&nbsp; Well how about =
this?&nbsp; &quot;This would be a heck of lot easier if this was =
[grammar incorrect] a dictatorship.... just so long as I'm the =
dictator.&nbsp; Heh, heh.&quot;&nbsp; Well, sorry to say folks, but I =
got my way.&nbsp; What are you gonna do about it, huh?&nbsp; Bring it =
on!!!<BR>
