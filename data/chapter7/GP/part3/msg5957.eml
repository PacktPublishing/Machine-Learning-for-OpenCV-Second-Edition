<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>I'm Ashley ^_^ . I am attending collage. I am soon =
turning 19. Life is short, so I decided to have a web site about my =
life. At first it was fun, but now I am in love with it. I am looking =
for a cyber friend that I can chat with and who knows where that can =
take us. The best thing is, I made it totally free. no fee, I only ask =
of you to verify your age. I had a problem before a minor came and I got =
in big trouble. I almost got kicked out from collage because of this, =
and I dont' want to make the same mistake again. I am usually on my cam, =
If not I made many videos and pictures about my self.. Bye speak to you =
soon ;D.<BR>
