ABOUT THE COMPANY<BR>
<BR>
XcelPlus is a specialty chemicals and lubricants distributor. We provide =
solutions to every day problems people encounter on the job, in their =
cars, homes as well as in the air. The formulas we provide have been =

the years in countless applications. They have been marketed under =
various private labels; Lubrilon, Slick 50 (1978-1984), Matrix, Camtron, =

This has happened in countless numbers of automobiles as well over the =
years some times even intentionally. Transmissions have been enabled to =
perform better, racers have discovered us as well including some =
