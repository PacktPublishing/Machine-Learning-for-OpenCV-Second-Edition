Never cackle unless you lay.<BR>

The bigger they are the harder they fall. . Silence is less injurious =
than a bad reply. . Nothing is ill said if it is not ill taken. . A fool =
in a gown is none the wiser. .<BR>
Oaks may fall when reeds take the storm.<BR>
<BR>
Too many clicks spoil the browse.<BR>
<BR>
no more?<BR>

.Better safe than sorry. . True beauty lies within. . A bad excuse is =
better then none. .<BR>
Always you are to be rich next year. . Anger and hate hinder good =
counsel. . An elephant never forgets. .<BR>
<BR>
Fore-warned is fore-armed. . Don't cross the bridge till you come to it. =
. Variety is the spice of life. .<BR>
