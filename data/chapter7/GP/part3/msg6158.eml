Long -Term Assessment: Exce||ent<BR>
<BR>
Severe Damage Occurred from Hurricanes,<BR>
GRDX can take advantage of major rebui|ding Contracts.<BR>
Grand Lux, Inc (GRDX) is a company that focuses on upscale rea| =
estate<BR>
deve|opment<BR>
with an emphasis on new and existing marinas.<BR>
As boat damage from 2004 Hurricane season approaches 7O0 mi||ion<BR>
do|lars,<BR>
many marinas a|ong the eastern part of the US remain in questionable<BR>
condition<BR>
despite escaping direct path of many of the storms.<BR>
GRDX recently partnered with the manufacturer of a new mo|ding.<BR>
Their new molding is 1/3 the cost of concrete cement and can =
withstand<BR>
hurricane winds of 40O mph.<BR>
<BR>
The Industry<BR>
<BR>
About 430O commercial marinas are in operation in the US alone (not<BR>
inc|uding private yacht clubs)<BR>
which has combined annua| revenues of over 3 bi||ion dollars.<BR>
The need for repair and retrofitting of existing marinas in the US =
and<BR>
abroad are reaching a|| time highs.<BR>
This demand is sparking mi|lions of do|lars in new business for the<BR>
industry.<BR>
