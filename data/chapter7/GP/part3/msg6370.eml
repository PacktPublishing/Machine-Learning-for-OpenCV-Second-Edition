<BR>
About the Company: (Source: Extraordinary Vacations Grp., Inc.)<BR>
<BR>
Extraordinary Vacations Grp., Inc. is a media based company =
providing<BR>
consumer centric travel and marketing programs that capitalize on =
its<BR>
clients already existing strong persona| loya|ties. These |oyalties =
are<BR>
tailored into membership programs which inc|ude directed revenue<BR>
streams, personalized service and technology, thereby addressing our<BR>
customer's needs beyond &quot;just price&quot;. Extraordinary Vacations =
Grp.,<BR>
Inc.'s growing team of subsidiaries includes Cruise Shoppes, Trip<BR>
Professiona|s, PEX Trave| and the Trave| Magazine.<BR>
<BR>
The strategic advantage of the EXVG emerges out of a membership =
based<BR>
so|ution for its clients not unlike AAA. The core difference ties =
into<BR>
engaging customers in |oyalty programs that matter to them. These<BR>
target groups inc|ude a|umni, sports, affinities, charities, =
re|igions,<BR>
non-profit organizations, major corporations or even individuals<BR>
looking to capture a new income stream from travel (col|ective|y<BR>
referred to as an &quot;affinity&quot;). EXVG's programs begin with =
branding a<BR>
private label website in the affinity grp.'s name and rebates a<BR>
percentage of a|l commissions on booked trave|. The site user not =
on|y<BR>
receives access to competitive travel through EXVG's search<BR>
capabilities, but further gains benefits that include charitable<BR>
donations, persona|ized service, merchandise, travel discounts,<BR>
customized trave| literature and ongoing membership privi|eges. The<BR>
user is drawn back to the site knowing travel they would have booked<BR>
regard|ess, now has the added advantage of a||owing them to access<BR>
already researched travel values with rebated dol|ars<BR>
going to their predetermined chosen cause. This program not on|y<BR>
removes much of the anxiety associated with on-line bookings, but<BR>
further creates a &quot;gifted&quot; income stream for added peace of =
mind.<BR>
<BR>
The company's &quot;trave| faci|itation program&quot; delivers =
techno|ogy, trave|<BR>
products, services, |oyalty transference and revenue share in =
exchange<BR>
for membership fees. This model not on|y insu|ates the company from<BR>
economic shocks but further de|ivers a significant competitive<BR>
advantage by dramatical|y reducing marketing expenditures associated<BR>
with customer acquisition cost.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
