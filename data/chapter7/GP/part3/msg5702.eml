Forget about your partner faking her orgasm or not being able to =
please<BR>
her. You will be able to penetrate deeper so your partner will =
experience<BR>
more pleasure as well as multiple orgasms during sexual intercourse.<BR>
86% of women surveyed said that they would like their partner to be =
more<BR>
'full' sexually.<BR>

I hope you will favor me with another interview, said the king, for I =
am<BR>
much interested in your electrical inventions.&lt;br&gt;I will instruct =
my guards<BR>
to admit you at any time, so you will not be obliged to fight your =
way<BR>
