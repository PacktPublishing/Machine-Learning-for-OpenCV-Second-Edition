that she tryed to email me but she couldn't for some reason... I'm tired =
of this computer stuff, never works :/ I don't know if you ever got my =
messages now, so I don't know if you like me or not... I updated my =
website recently with few pics so you know how I look like here <A =
HREF=3D"http://relax4u.info/michelle/index.html">http://relax4u.info/mich=
elle/index.html</A> ... btw let's chat via webcam, I got my roomate =
Veronica to setup webcam somehow, I don't even know how it works, but =
she toled me all I need to chat with someone is to verify age or =
something because it's the law and minors can accidently see it due to =
my sexy videos i got ;)...<BR>
