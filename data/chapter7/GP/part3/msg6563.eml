I would like to begin by way of introduction; My name is Paul =
Khumalo<BR>
a native of South Africa. I am a senior employee of South Africa<BR>
Department of Transport. You were introduced to us in confidence<BR>
through the South African Chambers of Commerce and Foreign trade<BR>
division. I am writing this letter to solicit your co-operation<BR>
in order to redeem an investment currently held under trust with<BR>
the Department of Transport of South Africa.<BR>
The said investment now valued at USD$6,246M(Six Million Two Hundred<BR>
and Forty Six thousand United States dollars), was originally =
purchased<BR>
by one Mr. Bryan Smith, and leased to the Transvaal Orange Transport<BR>
Corporation in 1977. Since the maturity of this contract in =
September<BR>
1997, several attempts have been made without success to contact<BR>
Mr. Bryan Smith or any of his close relatives, in whose favour the<BR>
investment cash value can be paid. My partner, who is the Account<BR>
Director in the same Ministry and I, have initiated the process of<BR>
filing a claim for this money with the hope of having the funds =
transferred to<BR>
you.<BR>
In order to do this, we will swear an affidavit in the High Court of<BR>
my country stating that you are a distant cousin and next of kin to =
Mr.<BR>
Bryan Smith the owner of the money and giving you the legal =
authority<BR>
to administer his estate. After which, we will file a claim for this<BR>
money from the Department 0f Transport, indicating that you were =
appointed<BR>
by Mr. Bryan Smith to be the beneficiary of these funds.<BR>
When the claim is approved you as the beneficiary will be paid the =
sum<BR>
of USD$6.246M. The money will be paid directly to any bank of your =
choice;<BR>
you will have the responsibility to ensure that my partner and I =
receive<BR>
75% of the money while you keep the remaining 20% for your assistance. =
The<BR>
remaining 5% will be for incidental expenses. I want to assure you =
that<BR>
my partner and I are in a position to make the payment of this claim<BR>
possible provided that you can give us very strong guarantee that our =
share will<BR>
be secured, and that you will not take advantage of our position.<BR>
Be assured that there is absolutely nothing to worry about in view<BR>
of this claim. It is perfectly safe with no risks involved, and it is =
not subject to<BR>
any inquiry, since my partner and I will be handling the claim directly =
in<BR>
South Africa on your behalf. I do hope my proposal is acceptable to =
you.<BR>
Please acknowledge the receipt of this letter, so that I can provide you =
with<BR>
more clarification about the claim and how we intend to make this =
deal<BR>
beneficial to everyone involved.<BR>
Yours Sincerely<BR>
Paul Khumalo.<BR>
