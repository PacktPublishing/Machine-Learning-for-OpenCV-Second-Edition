One day, Tim's mathematic teacher looked at his homework and saw that =
he<BR>
had got all his sums right, The teacher was very pleased-and rather<BR>
surprised, He called Tim to his desk and said to him, &quot;You got all =
your<BR>
homework right this time, Tim. What happened? Did your father help<BR>
you?&quot;Usually Tim's father did help him with his homework, but the =
evening<BR>
before this, he had not been able to, because he had not been at home, =
so<BR>
Tim answered, &quot;No, sir. He was busy last night, so I had to do it =
all<BR>
myself.&quot;<BR>
The boss was complaining in our staff meeting the other day that he =
wasn't<BR>
getting any respect. Later that morning he went to a local card and =
novelty<BR>
shop and bought a small sign that read, &quot;I'm the Boss&quot;. He =
then taped it to<BR>
his office door.Later that day when he returned from lunch, he found =
that<BR>
someone had taped a note to the sign that said. &quot;Your wife called, =
she wants<BR>
her sign back!&quot;<BR>
