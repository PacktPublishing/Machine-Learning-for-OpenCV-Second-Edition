&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My husband is now on a three =
week business trip to Asia and I am left home alone in this city.&nbsp; =
Since we recently moved here all the friends we have are his business =
partners.&nbsp; Our house is a mansion and I feel trapped as if a =
jail.&nbsp; I need to get out, I feel naughty and want someone to share =
it with.&nbsp; He won't be back for another 16 days and I can't spend it =
without some mischief.&nbsp; I even listed myself at <A =
HREF=3D"http://www.peachpiev2.biz/176646/chws/fullpage.php">http://www.pe=
achpiev2.biz/176646/chws/fullpage.php</A> .&nbsp; That's really what I =
want.&nbsp; Someone to bone be so nard that I can't take it =
anymore.&nbsp; No one will know of our secret and I just need someone to =
fc uk the hell out of me. Use the <A =

of me.<BR>
