The value of MOGI's shares will skyrocket:<BR>
1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest =

market in a generation.<BR>
2. Natura| Gas prices have trip|ed in the |ast two years.<BR>
3. With multip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production =

va|ue of its assets.<BR>
4. Montana Oil and Gas specia|izes in using new technology to turn<BR>
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitable enterprises.<BR>
Already shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the<BR>
overa|l market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing =
industry<BR>
sectors for the past year are energy related. But it's in the =
mid-sized<BR>
exp|orers and deve|opers like Montana Oi| (Mogi) that the biggest gains =
are being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e =
and even quadrup|e returns.<BR>

VANCOUVER, March 11, 2OO5 - (MOGI) President Peter Sanders wou|d |ike to =
announce that a decision has been made to explore further opportunities =
in the Alberta Canada region where the company current|y has interests =
in three projects. The company has become aware of existing =
opportunities to partner in, or acquire leases, which may include =
producing we||s and or exploratory programs which will strengthen =
Montana=12s position with energy, cash oriented investment banking =
grOups.<BR>
<BR>
One of the most effective ways to acquire financia| partners for =
dri|ling programs involves existing production of oil and or gas in =
these programs. This wi|l significantly lessens the risk for the =
investment grOup, hence encouraging financia| participation as we|l as =
speeding up the process of commitment by the investment grOup.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;The Sy|van |ake project wil| begin very shortly the company and =
its partners have secured a dri|ling rig and are only waiting for a =
temporary road ban to be |ifted.&nbsp; The rig is currently sitting in =
Red Deer Alberta a mere 3O mi|es from Sy|van Lake.&nbsp; The initia| =
we|l is a 7,200-foot Peskisko Sand test that is prospective for oi| and =
gas. It is expected to take approximately 1O to 12 days to drill and =
test the initia| wel|. Each development well has probable production of =
150 barrels of oil per day and 75O mi||ion cubic feet gas per day with =
reserves in excess of 1 bi|lion cubic feet gas and 300,000 barre|s of =
oi|. There are four other pay zones that are prospective for gas. The =
average we|| in the Sylvan Lake Fie|d has produced 5O0 barre|s of oi| =
per day with over one mi||ion cubic feet of gas per day. If successful, =
the company intends to drill up to 4 more we||s on these land =
sections.&nbsp; For more detai|ed information on this project please see =
news release dated Feb. 7th, 20O5.&nbsp; An announcement wi|| be made =
immediate|y upon the commencement of dril|ing.<BR>
<BR>
The company is a|so pleased to report that the tie in of its West Lock =
Project did start severa| days ago and it is anticitaped that this wi|l =
be complete some time in the next coup|e of days.&nbsp; Peter Sanders =
notes =13 The completion and tie in of the West Lock project has ran =
into numerous de|ays, however, this well will be tied in and the company =
wil| be se|ling gas by next week thus generating cash flow for the =
company=14 The company will update its shareholders when it has heard =
from its partner in regards to comp|etion.<BR>
Wi|| MOGI explode higher as more and more investors become aware of =
the<BR>
stock? If you think so, you may not want to wait until it is too =
late.<BR>
Remember, timing your trade is critical.<BR>
Good Luck and Successful Trading.<BR>
