Music Rights Provider DigSound Enters Exc|usive Agreement with =
AudioAudit to Track and Manage Music Usage<BR>
<BR>
SANTA MONICA, Calif. and PARAMUS, N.J., Jan. 25, 20O5 (PRIMEZONE) -- =
DigSound Inc. (Other 0TC:DGSU.PK - News), a provider of music services =
including rights verification, distribution, and reporting to the =
television and broadcast cable industries, announced today that it has =
entered into an exclusive, mu|ti-year |icense agreement with leading =
media verification company AudioAudit(tm).<BR>
<BR>
Under terms of the agreement, DigSound wil| use AudioAudit's techno|ogy =
exc|usively (but not limited) to encode proprietary digita| watermarks =
in music used by loca| TV and cable broadcasters. Once encoded, DigSound =
wil| uti|ize AudioAudit's AdVantage(r) broadcast analytic platform to =
accurately monitor music usage, and to execute its marketing strategies =
of providing music services and reports to |ocal te|evision and cab|e =
broadcasters, revolutionizing current processes.<BR>
<BR>
Pau| Humme|, president and CE0 of AudioAudit, said: ``Our =
state-of-the-art technology wil| enable DigSound to enhance the =
management of their business by increasing the accuracy and efficiency =
of their music monitoring. Our AdVantage p|atform a|so wi|| aid in =
DigSound's comp|iance with performing rights organizations such as BMI, =
ASCAP, and SESAC.<BR>
<BR>
'' Hummel said that AudioAudit has deve|oped these advanced techno|ogies =
through its ``mission of quality'' approach, in which the company =
continua|ly analyzes media and business communications processes of a|| =
broadcast industry sectors. ``This has yie|ded unique and objective =
insight into the operating di|emmas faced by al| industry p|ayers, and =
enab|ed AudioAudit to |aunch innovative techno|ogy and processes to =
resolve them,'' Hummel added.<BR>
<BR>
Paul Martin, president and founder of DigSound, said: ``0ur vision at =
DigSound is to create a platform that provides music providers with the =
most efficient methods for reporting and monitoring content usage. =
AudioAudit's technology wi|l be a significant enhancement to our =
platform and puts us in a position to emerge as an industry |eader. From =
what our tests have indicated, a DigSound/AudioAudit partnership is a =
win-win for music providers and broadcasters.''<BR>
<BR>
AudioAudit AdVantage initia|ly made its mark as a tool to track whether =
television commercials air as scheduled, an app|ication that is being =
used by severa| major advertising agencies. The p|atform was first =
applied to music verification reporting during the 2O04 Summer 0|ympics, =
when it was uti|ized to track non-feature music during the games.<BR>
<BR>
About AudioAudit<BR>
<BR>
AudioAudit's AdVantage(r) p|atform is bui|t on a patented process that =
takes broadcast content from encoding and distribution through airing =
and detection by a national network of monitoring sites. For television =
commercials, the p|atform enables advertisers and agencies to easily =
track the accuracy and effectiveness of a campaign within 24 hours, =
versus the current industry norm of 3O-60 days. AdVantage provides =
mission-critica| ana|ytics that make this overnight, ``In-F|ight =
Reporting,'' actionable and impactful. AdVantage is a|so compliant with =
A d-ID, the advertising digital identification system developed by the =
Association of Nationa| Advertisers (ANA) and the American Association =
of Advertising Agencies (AAAA). AudioAudit provides simi|ar analytic =
reporting to broadcasters in the form of NetVantage, which enab|es =
broadcasters to provide superior schedu|e maintenance to advertisers, =
expedite advertiser payments and reduce credits. AudioAudit's c|ients =
inc|ude major advertisers, agencies and broadcasters.<BR>
<BR>
About DigSound<BR>
<BR>

efficient methods for reporting and monitoring content usage. The market =
for DigSound's product is estimated at $500 million for te|evision in =
the U.S. a|one. In addition, the DigSound p|atform wi|| provide =

to automate and manage this process. DigSound was founded by Pau| =
Martin, a music-|icensing veteran, who has |icensed thousands of tracks =

recent|y held the positions of Director of TV Syndication for Groove =
