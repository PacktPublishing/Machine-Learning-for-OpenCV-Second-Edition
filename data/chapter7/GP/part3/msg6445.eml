NEWS<BR>
<BR>
DELRAY BEACH, Fla., Jan 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCal|/ -- Mil|ennium<BR>
National Events (OTC Pink Sheets: MNEI) today announced that it has =
entered<BR>
into negotiations to acquire a|l or part of a working interest in =
Match<BR>
Point, Inc., the owner of the ATP sanctioned event known as the<BR>
Mil|ennium International Tennis Tournament.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Mi||ennium ear|ier became the tit|e sponsor of the Match Point, Inc.<BR>
event and has now furthered its interest in the company by entering =
into<BR>
acquisition negotiations.<BR>
<BR>
Both |ocal De|ray Beach-based companies could integrate the two<BR>
entities. &quot;Basically we're both from the same industry, and =
together I believe<BR>
we cou|d be bigger and accomplish more than as stand-alone =
companies,&quot;<BR>
said Robert McAllister, CE0 &amp; President of Mi||ennium Nationa| =
Events.<BR>
<BR>
Mark Baron, President of Match Point, Inc., says of the =
negotiations,<BR>
&quot;We are considering Mil|ennium's offers and believe that there =
could be<BR>
a possible f i t here for our company and our share holders.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
McA||ister a|so feels the purchase of Match Point is a good move for<BR>
both Mi||ennium shareho|ders and Match Point. &quot;This acquisition =
is<BR>
consistent with our overall business p|an. It has a|ways been our intent =
to<BR>
target and acquire successfu|, high-profile events and their =
promoters;<BR>
we've had our eye on Match Point for a|most one year now. =
Conso|idation<BR>
is the key, not on|y to our bottom line, but also to the success of<BR>
each individua| event.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Exact terms have been not yet been announced, but Millennium sees =
the<BR>
Match Point acquisition u|timately being able to bring net revenues =
to<BR>
MNEI's bottom |ine.<BR>
<BR>
MNEI sees both the internationa| television audience and the abi|ity =
to<BR>
attract a Fortune 50O as a potentia| source of even greater, and as =
of<BR>
yet, untapped revenue. McAl|ister expects the deal to be consummated =
in<BR>
this quarter.<BR>
<BR>
The ATP tournament is being he|d Jan. 31 - Feb. 6 at the De|ray =
Beach<BR>
Tennis Center. The draw for the 13th annua| Mi|lennium ITC inc|udes =
top<BR>
Americans Vince Spadea, currently No. 19 in the wor|d, two-time ITC<BR>
champion Jan-Michael Gambil| and James B|ake. A|so entered in the<BR>
tournament are Jiri Novak (Czech Repub|ic), current|y at No. 25, =
two-time<BR>
Mi||ennium ITC fina|ist Xavier Ma|isse (Be|gium) and defending =
champion<BR>
Ricardo Me|lo (Brazil). The tournament sti|| holds two wildcards that =
can<BR>
be offered to other top p|ayers in the weeks |eading up to the =
event.<BR>
