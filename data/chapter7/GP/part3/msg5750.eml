Hi Varou,=20
<p>
What is the ideal dosage for the drug that treats impotence in men? I =
find that 25 mg two hours prior to sex is best for me, and allows =
sensitivity, to remain at its peak. When trying 50 or 100,mg,  it took =
away much of the feeling, and you need stimulation to maintain erection. =
More is definitely not better, in my case. - Phil, Age 60, California
