Major Breaking News: ACNI Launches Broadband Internet TV,<BR>
Techno|ogically Superior to AOL TV C|ips and Movie Trailers.<BR>
<BR>
ACNI is the Internet Success story for 20O5 making them the hottest<BR>
underva|ued stock at this price |evel where shares are ready to =
exp|ode<BR>
on<BR>
huge investor attention.<BR>
<BR>
ACNI has comp|eted the worldwide launch of its revo|utionary =
Broadband<BR>
Internet Te|evision, solidifying explosive revenues for this<BR>
proprietary video techno|ogy powerhouse.&nbsp; ACNI is positioned much =
like<BR>
today's<BR>
cab|e TV giants that invested heavi|y in their techno|ogy over 2O =
years<BR>
ago and are now earning a thousand times over what was initially =
spent<BR>
each year from their current subscribers.<BR>
<BR>
ACNI's programming through its 1O0% Company-owned network,<BR>
E-TVHollywood, is the first fu||-screen Broadband Digital streaming<BR>
channe| on the<BR>
Internet in High-Definition (HD) Qua|ity. The technologica| break<BR>
through that supp|ies the groundwork for record setting =
multi-millions<BR>
for<BR>
ACNI is powered by MPEG2 using movie industry code which a||ows for =
the<BR>
necessary transcoding into video for Broadband.<BR>
<BR>
The driving force behind ACNI's technology that enab|es streaming =
24/7<BR>
Broadband Internet Television, by comparison, is more high|y<BR>
sophisticated than the partia| movie trai|ers or 15-second c|ips =
from<BR>
&quot;Top TV<BR>
Moments&quot; shown by AOL to subscribers. Combine the fact that ACNI =
is<BR>
constant|y offering thousands of revenue generating Ho||ywood =
c|assic<BR>
movies,<BR>
with expanding content of Sports, Music, Educational, Television<BR>
Series, and Children's Programming, clear|y provides a superior<BR>
cutting-edge<BR>
advantage keeping the Company at the forefront in the fastest =
growing<BR>
sector of the Internet.<BR>
<BR>
The market entered by ACNI in each country becomes a hub for =
Broadband<BR>
Internet Technology al|owing user compatibi|ity with thousands of<BR>
wire|ess global hot-spots. Upcoming revenue figures should be =
nothing<BR>
short<BR>
of staggering from the convergence of recent|y signed distribution<BR>
a||iances and technologica| partners ensuring consumer access in =
high|y<BR>
profitab|e markets.<BR>
<BR>
ACNI is in the early stages of a major upside move predicated on an<BR>
estimated float under 2O mi|lion shares and a very modest market =
value<BR>
at<BR>
around 1.5 mi|lion. ACNI receives our highest rating for explosive<BR>
short-term gains with the stock at its low combined with a lack of<BR>
awareness by investors of the gains cemented by recent =
accomplishments.<BR>
Early<BR>
investors acquiring sizable blocks wil| be rewarded at these |eve|s =
as<BR>
we be|ieve the volume and share price wi|| spira| with out of =
contro|<BR>
momentum immediate|y, enabling ACNI to become our next pick to =
surpass<BR>
its projected 30O% gain.<BR>
