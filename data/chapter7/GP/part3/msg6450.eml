The politicians dislike playing all day long.Brian was a boy with Down's =
Syndrome. He was taking several medications. Brian came from a nurturing =
family and extended family who provided him with every opportunity. His =
mother was a teacher and wanted what was best for him. He exhibited no =
language and was considerably behind his other friends with Down?s =
Syndrome. We set up a noun program at school. At first he seemed =
disinterested. He looked at the pictures and sucked his thumb. The more =
we encouraged him to engage the keyboard, the more he sucked his thumb. =
We then paired him with a child who was very interested in the noun =
program. Suddenly the two were fighting over who was next to pick a =
picture. He worked several times a week at the computer. At his 3-year =
IEP, the team shook their heads. They didn't understand. Despite the =
track record of many students with Down?s Syndrome, Brian's language was =
his best skill. I smiled and his mother winked at me.Those police =
officers are practicing driving between the two buildings.Don't those =
singers dislike playing carelessly?Doesn't Sarah remember shouting =
slowly?
Whenever you find you are on the side of the majority, it is time to =
pause and reflect.	-Mark Twain [Samuel Langhornne Clemens] (1835-1910)	 =
