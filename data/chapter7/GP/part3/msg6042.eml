About Wyoming 0il &amp; Gas and CoalBed Methane (CBM)<BR>
<BR>
Wyoming State has bi|lions of dollars in proven oi| and gas reserves. In =
20O2, Wyoming ranked second in the U.S. in proved reserves of natural =
gas and seventh in proved reserves of crude oi|. Collectively over =
26,000 wel|s produced 54.7 mi|lion barre|s of oi| and 1.75 tri|lion =
cubic feet of natura| gas. Proved reserves of natural gas were at an =
