<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Dear Beloved,<BR>
<BR>
I am Mrs Cathrine Smiths&nbsp; from Liberia. I am married to Mr.Mark =
Smiths, who worked with Liberian embassy in Lome-Togo for Ten years =
before he died in the year 2002. We were married for eleven years =
without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only nine =
days.Before his death we were both born again Christian.Since his death =
I decided not to remarry or get a child outside my matrimonial =
home,because I loved him. When my late husband was alive he deposited =
the sum of $7.8Million (Seven Million Eight hundred thousand =
U.S.Dollars)&nbsp; with one security company in Europe.<BR>
<BR>
Presently, this money is still with the Security Company.Reasons of =
contacting you now,is that since&nbsp; one year, I have been =
sick,and&nbsp; recently my Doctor told me that the sickness is getting =
worst,that I may not last for the next Few months due to cancer problem =
and stroke sickness which disturbs me most.Having known my condition, I =
decided to use this money for charity,I want an individual that will use =
this fund for orphanages, widows, and also propagating the word of =
God&nbsp; and to&nbsp; endeavor that the house of Lord is maintained. =
The Holy Bible made us to understand that Blessed is the hand that =
giveth. I took this decision because I don't have any child that will =
inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christian, and I =
don't want my husbands efforts to be used by extravagantly.<BR>
<BR>
I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly =
way. This is why I am taking this decision. I am not afraid of death =
hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom =
of the Almighty God .I don't need any telephone communication in this =
regard because of my health and the presence of my husband's relatives =
around me always. I don't want them to know about this development. With =
God all things are possible.<BR>
<BR>
As soon as I receive your reply I shall inform the security company in =
Europe that you are the beneficiary of the said consignment you will =
need to go and claim this fund there. I will also issue you an authority =
letter or through email that will prove you as the present beneficiary =
of this fund. I want you to always pray for me because the lord is my =
shepherd. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy =
Christian.Whoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit =
and truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life.<BR>
<BR>
Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing another person for =
this same&nbsp; purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly =
as I stated herein. You can also send your response through my e-mail =
address below:<BR>

<BR>
Hoping to receive your reply and Remain blessed in the Lord.<BR>
<BR>
Yours in God,<BR>
<BR>
Mrs. Cathrine Smiths.<BR>
