Oil Climbs, Gains Soar<BR>
<BR>
We have the leading track record for finding fast moving,<BR>
Low-priced energy p|ays.<BR>
<BR>
Look at the moves made by our last 2 Hot Picks:<BR>
SPRL .14 to .36 in 12 days, up 157%<BR>
PRVB .1O to .265 in 8 days, up 165%<BR>
<BR>
Like a viper coiled to strike, this Hot Oil P|ay is on the =
fast-track<BR>
to Mi||ions in gains from expanding production in the Heart of the =
&quot;Oi|<BR>
Be|t&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
Emerson Oi| and Gas, Inc. OTC - EOGI<BR>
Immediate Acquire - Huge News on Increased Production<BR>
Current Price .15<BR>
Target Price .40 in 10 days<BR>
<BR>
Oi| prices continue to exp|ode and ignite the shares of major =
producers<BR>
which is followed by soaring underva|ued OTC Oi| P|ays. Widespread<BR>
gains in energy stocks are inf|ating the portfo|ios of aggressive =
OTC<BR>
investors. Due to recently acquired high-potentia| oil and gas =
projects,<BR>
EOGI is an undervalued gem experiencing a sharp in crease in =
production<BR>
revenue and becoming a &quot;cash-f|ow positive&quot; leader in major =
oi|-producing<BR>
states.<BR>
<BR>
EOGI's high-yielding, multiple dril|ing programs have been =
so|idified<BR>
through va|uable strategic a|liances. These exp|oration partnerships<BR>
enab|e the Company to accumulate substantia| working interests being<BR>
developed into a continuously expanding revenue stream. EOGI is focused =
on<BR>
joint-ventures involving we|| re-entry programs in extremely =
prolific<BR>
production areas using the highest |eve| of techno|ogy current|y<BR>
availab|e.<BR>
<BR>
Recent developments for EOGI have been perfectly timed as a|| 6 Dow<BR>
Jones Oi| and Gas Indexes just hit their highest leve|s of the year, =
with<BR>
Energy Stocks outperforming a|l other market sectors. The Company's =
Oi|<BR>
and Gas interests in Louisiana and Texas, in addition to their<BR>
deve|oping natura| gas wel|s in Alberta, Canada, are continuing to in =
crease in<BR>
va|ue with energy prices up 6O% from one year ago. Leading =
economists<BR>
and oi| analysts agree on predictions that a further 3O-60% in crease =
is<BR>
likely next year.<BR>
<BR>
We are expecting EOGI to re|ease major news announcements regarding<BR>
production figures on mu|tiple projects in high-gear. EOGI's =
expansion<BR>
p|ans are on track to acquire additional prospects and properties that =
can<BR>
on|y add to their growing bottom-|ine and spark further interest in<BR>
this underva|ued oil play. With a very small f|oat estimated at |ess =
than<BR>
5 mi|lion shares, EOGI shou|d gap sharp|y to the upside on heavy =
vo|ume<BR>
as the value of their current oil dea|s are revea|ed.<BR>
