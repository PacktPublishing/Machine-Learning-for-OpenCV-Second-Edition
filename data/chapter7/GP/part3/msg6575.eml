market utilizing its sales and distribution channels.&nbsp; </p><p>RTI =
is a leader in mycorrhiza and advanced nutrition products for new forest =
plantation, mine reclamation and erosion control, and is North America's =
number one producer of premium mycorrhizal inoculant. Their Planter Pak =
Technology combines a sophisticated blend of controlled release =
fertilizers in a simple and highly effective ``Root Zone Delivery'' =
system. Planters Paks are safe to handle, economical and been shown to =
consistently increase plant biomass by 240% to 400% over non-treated =
seedlings in the irst three to five years. RTI's proven technology has =
been used for over a decade in Reforestation, Mine Reclamation, Land =
Restoration and Ornamental Applications.</p><p>Wei Li, Chairman and CEO =
of KWBT stated, ``KWBT is pleased to enter into this alliance with RTI. =
Their premium mycorrhizal products are best used in native vegetation =
restoration, forestry and agriculture due to their ability to form an =
extensive hyphal network in soil.'' Li continued, ``Desertification has =
been claiming land at the speed of 600,000 acres per year in China since =
the 1990s. Currently, total desertification in China stands at =
650,000,000 acres, which is 27.3% of the total area of the country. =
Among this land, close to 20,000,000 acres are arable lands. =
Reforestation has been a continuous effort that may reach up to =
7,000,000 acres per year.'' Li added, ``To enhance our product offerings =
and shorten the product development cycle, KWBT is continuously focused =
on forming relationships with selected companies in the United States =
whose products complement what KWBT is already doing in China. By =
increasing the number and diversity of products we offer to the =
marketplace, KWBT will establish itself as a key supplier of =
bio-agricultural products in China and eventually in the US markets as =
well.'' </p><p>KWBT develops, manufactures and distributes innovative, =
cost-effective, and environmentally-safe bio-technological products to =
