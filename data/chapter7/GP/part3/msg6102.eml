About the Company<BR>
<BR>
YOUTH AND AMATEUR SPORTS COMPANY POISED FOR GROWTH<BR>
<BR>
Intelligent Sports, Inc. is a publicly held company trading on the OTC =
markets under the ticker symbol &quot;IGTS&quot;. Intelligent Sports =
will be the holding company for several sports related businesses.<BR>
Intelligent Sports provides business units with strategic guidance and =
support in the areas of marketing, sales, sponsorships, partnerships, =
policy &amp; procedures, finance and expansion.<BR>
Their initial business launch is to develop youth and amateur sports =
centers throughout the country that offers a year-round sports calendar =
with emphasis on youth and amateur sports programs and skill =
development.<BR>
Their plan is to expand this concept into membership-based, =
multi-purpose sports facilities that will promote a diverse range of =
sports programs, leagues, tournaments, clinics, individual sports skill =
development and nutritional training.<BR>
<BR>
YOUTH AND AMATEUR SPORTS INDUSTRY OVERVIEW<BR>
<BR>
Organized youth sports is a growing industry. Over 20 million boys and =
girls participate in organized youth sports in the United States. Gone =
are the days of backyard, pick-up sports.<BR>
These days, kids from five to eighteen are being organized into school =
and parent-sponsored sports programs requiring intense preparation and =
better competition.<BR>
These demands have caused an incredible increase in cost and shortage of =
training, equipment and facilities for organized youth sports.<BR>
Additionally, parents today are investing in their children and looking =
for youth sports organizations that are supportive, motivational and =
provide a constructive environment for participating and learning.<BR>
These concerns and values create a competitive advantage for Intelligent =
Sports, Inc. Our youth and amateur programs will provide an ongoing and =
long-term relationship with our parents and youth supported with yearsof =
professional experience and personal integrity. Intelligent Sports<BR>
will provide recreational, developmental and competitive programs for =
youth sports that will be fun, bring families together and teach =
children life lessons about teamwork, setting goals and the value of =
hard work.<BR>
