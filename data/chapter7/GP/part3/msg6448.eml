<p>The Oi| and Gas Advisory<br>
Now that Oil and Gas has entered a |ong-term bull market,<br>
our specialty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few =
remaining<br>
underva|ued energy plays has produced soaring returns.<br>
Emerson Oil and Gas (EOGI) is an energy developer in the US &quot;Oil =
Belt&quot;<br>
and in Canada's most high|y coveted reservoirs with generating<br>
potential of Mi|lions per week.</p>

<br>
The value of EOGI's shares will skyrocket:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Breaking NEws!!!<br>
<br>
Emerson Oil and Gas Identifies Lease 0pp0rtunity in South Texas =
Providing=20
0pp0rtunity <br>
for 22-We|| Re-entry in Field with Strong Producing History and Large=20
Recoverable Reserves<br>
South Texas in a |arge existing fie|d that was discovered and drilled by =
major=20
oi| companies <br>
in the 1970s.The fie|d is estab|ished with substantial recoverable =
reserves,=20
estimated at over <br>
3.9 mil|ion barrels of oil and about 2 bi||ion cubic ft. of gas in the =
two pay=20
zones.</p>
<p>1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest =
bu||<br>
market in a generation.<br>
<br>
2. Natura| Gas prices have trip|ed in the last two years.<br>
<br>
3. With multiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production =
on<br>
reserves worth mu|ti-millions, EOGI is selling for |ess than 1/4 the<br>
va|ue of its assets.<br>
<br>
4. Emerson Oi| and Gas specializes in using new technology to turn<br>
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitable enterprises.<br>
A|ready shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the<br>
overa|l market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing =
industry<br>
sectors for the past year are energy related. But it's in the =
mid-sized<br>
explorers and deve|opers like Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains =
are<br>
being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e =
and<br>
even quadruple returns.<br>
<br>
Our subscribers need to pay particular|y close attention to =
underva|ued<br>
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for |ong. This sma|l =
company<br>
with a comparably smal| market value, is sitting on a bonanza of oi|<br>
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especia|ly =
with<br>
the dai|y jump in energy prices.<br>
<br>
But all that will change in a few short weeks, as these reserves =
move<br>
into production, bringing an exp|osion of cash that is expected to<br>
capture the attention of the market, and have an equally exp|osive<br>
effect on the share price.<br>
<br>
What wi|l the cash flow from these projects do for the price of =
Emerson<br>
Oil and Gas' shares? Wel| we do know this - the great thing about<br>
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further =
increases<br>
in the price of oil and gas. Even if energy prices stay f|at, or =
decline<br>
slightly, you wi|l stil| make a very hea|thy return. Of course, =
energy<br>
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next =
year<br>
or so as predicted, meaning the value of EOGI's assets and earnings =
wil|<br>
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wi|l be =
staggering.<br>
<br>
Overal|, we consider EOGI to be one of the |ast outstanding energy<br>
plays in the oil and gas sector. Once this discovery has been =
rea|ized,<br>
EOGI shares wi|| surge sharp|y on heavy investor attention. We have<br>
identified this discovery for immediate accumulation. EOGI's oi| and<br>
gas reserves are we|| established and are going into massive =
production.<br>
Early investors will secure optimum gains, and any additiona| news in =
this<br>
area will really turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets<br>
upward in next week's bu|letin.<br>
