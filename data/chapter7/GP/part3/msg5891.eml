<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Hi I'm Julie. I am just setting around in my victories =
secret underwear ;;). no tank top..., the weather out side is simply =
gorgeous. I live alone, yep well me and some girl friend renting out a =
place, its not easy but I make the best out of it. I am still in school, =
just turned 18. But me and my girls have so much fun&nbsp; simply enjoy =
what life has giving us, and I want to share this with you. if you have =
a moment come by say hi, its free. That's the best part about it. =
Hopefully I can meet some cyber friends, I feel great when I can =
entertain some one, who knows where that can lead us ;D, talk to you =
later sweet heart.<BR>
