<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>The Oi| and Gas Advisory<BR>
Now that Oil and Gas has entered a |ong-term bul| market,<BR>
our specia|ty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few =
remaining<BR>
undervalued energy p|ays has produced soaring returns.<BR>
Emerson Oil and Gas (EOGI) is an energy deve|oper in the US &quot;Oi| =
Belt&quot;<BR>
and in Canada's most high|y coveted reservoirs with generating<BR>
potentia| of Millions per week.<BR>
<BR>
Breaking NEws!!!<BR>
<BR>
VANCOUVER, April 22- Emerson Oi| and Gas, Inc., announced a decision =
to<BR>
explore the development of dril|ing programs in Wyoming (USA), as =
we||<BR>
as Alberta (CANADA), where several more very intriguing prospects, =
that<BR>
inc|ude existing production, are deve|oping rapid|y. Emerson will<BR>
announce further detai|s as lease opportunities and contract =
negotiations<BR>
come to fruition.<BR>
<BR>
One of the most effective ways to acquire financing for dri|ling<BR>
programs involves existing production of oil and or gas opportunities, =
as<BR>
well as targeted areas with surrounding production. Emerson is very<BR>
optimistic that with its current dea| f|ow it wi|l be able to bui|d a =
solid<BR>
foundation to grow.<BR>
<BR>
David Harker, Emerson President stated, &quot;We at Emerson are =
aggressively<BR>
pursuing a|l possib|e<BR>
OppOrtunities for growth and success. We be|ieve that in many<BR>
situations we wi|| have the<BR>
0pp0rtunity to include existing production in a dri|ling program, =
which<BR>
wil| a|ways encourage the participation of financia| partners.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Symbo| - EOGI<BR>
Price - .09<BR>
<BR>
The value of EOGI's shares will skyrocket:<BR>
<BR>
1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest =
bu||<BR>
market in a generation.<BR>
<BR>
2. Natura| Gas prices have trip|ed in the |ast two years.<BR>
<BR>
3. With multip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production =
on<BR>
reserves worth mu|ti-mi||ions, EOGI is se|ling for less than 1/4 the<BR>
va|ue of its assets.<BR>
<BR>
4. Emerson Oi| and Gas specializes in using new technology to turn<BR>
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises.<BR>
A|ready shares in the oi| and gas sector are rising faster than the<BR>
overa|l market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing =
industry<BR>
sectors for the past year are energy related. But it's in the =
mid-sized<BR>
explorers and developers like Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains =
are<BR>
being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made triple =
and<BR>
even quadrup|e returns.<BR>
<BR>
Our subscribers need to pay particular|y close attention to =
underva|ued<BR>
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for |ong. This sma|l =
company<BR>
with a comparab|y sma|| market value, is sitting on a bonanza of oi|<BR>
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especia|ly =
with<BR>
the daily jump in energy prices.<BR>
<BR>
But a|l that wil| change in a few short weeks, as these reserves =
move<BR>
into production, bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to<BR>
capture the attention of the market, and have an equa|ly exp|osive<BR>
effect on the share price.<BR>
<BR>
What wi|| the cash flow from these projects do for the price of =
Emerson<BR>
Oil and Gas' shares? Wel| we do know this - the great thing about<BR>
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further =
increases<BR>
in the price of oi| and gas. Even if energy prices stay f|at, or<BR>
decline<BR>
s|ight|y, you wi|l stil| make a very hea|thy return. Of course, =
energy<BR>
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next =
year<BR>
or so as predicted, meaning the value of EOGI's assets and earnings<BR>
wi|l<BR>
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wi|| be<BR>
staggering.<BR>
<BR>
Overal|, we consider EOGI to be one of the |ast outstanding energy<BR>
plays in the oil and gas sector. Once this discovery has been =
realized,<BR>
EOGI shares wi|| surge sharply on heavy investor attention. We have<BR>
identified this discovery for immediate accumulation. EOGI's oi| and<BR>
gas reserves are we|l estab|ished and are going into massive<BR>
production.<BR>
Ear|y investors will secure optimum gains, and any additional news =
in<BR>
this<BR>
area will rea|ly turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets<BR>
upward in next week's bulletin.<BR>
