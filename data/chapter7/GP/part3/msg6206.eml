<BR>
I am Dr.Salif Mamadou Project Director Senegal National Petroleum =
Corporation (S.N.P.C) and a Member of Contract Tenders Board of the same =
parastatal.Your highly valued contact was reliably introduced to me at =
the Foreign chamber of commerce and industry in my search for a reliable =
individual and company who can handle a strictly confidential =
transaction, which involves Transfer of reasonable sum of money to a =
foreign account.<BR>
<BR>
This money results from various contracts awarded by our corporation on =
behalf of the Federal Government, which was deliberately over invoiced =
to the tune of $11.500.000.00 (eleven Million Five Hundred Thousand =
United States dollars). After the completion and commissioning of the =
contract, the contractual sum was paid to the contractors, leaving the =
over invoiced sum in the reserve account with the Bank. We therefore =
require the partnership of a foreigner or foreign firm to assist us in =
form of a trustee and<BR>
provide a save and reliable account for this transfer.<BR>
<BR>
In the last meeting with my colleagues,it was unanimously agreed that =
30%of the total sum would be given to you. 60% for me and my colleagues =
while 10% will be used to reimburse the expenses that may be incurred =
during the course of this transaction.<BR>
I assure you, that this transaction is 100% one hundred percent risk =
free as we have concluded every arrangement to protect the interest of =
everyone involved. Likewise all modalities for the successful transfer =
of this money have been worked out with the<BR>
Finance Ministry and the Bank to facilitate the remittance of this money =
to any designated bank account.<BR>
<BR>
However, I will want to believe that you are honest enough and will not =
raise any misgiving with respect to this transaction.More importantly, =
you will keep this transaction very confidential so as not to jeopardize =
ones reputation and ambition.<BR>
<BR>
Please am waiting for your reply through my email:salifmamadou@post.cz =
or you call my telephone number for any question on +221 5190100.<BR>
<BR>
Trusting to hear from you immediately.<BR>
Best regards .<BR>
<BR>
Dr.Salif Mamadou.<BR>
