<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Goodday,<BR>
<BR>
I know this letter will come to you as a surprise; but this letter is =
borne out<BR>
<BR>
of my desire to establish a mutual business relationship with you,please =
keep it confidential!.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I am Mr Aliyu Mohamed the son of Dr Ibrahim Ahmed the former deputy<BR>
<BR>
finance minister under the ousted civilian government in Sierra =
Leone.<BR>
<BR>
My father was killed and mutilated by the military junta led by =
Major<BR>
<BR>
Paul Koroma after over throwing the elected government of President<BR>
<BR>
Tejan Kabba.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Though, I do not know to what extent you are familiar with events<BR>
<BR>
disturbances in Sierra leone, but the,pressure of war drove me and my =
mother<BR>
<BR>
out of Sierra Leone into exile in South Africa.Where we have been<BR>
<BR>
living under political asylum for three years.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Sadly, my mother died of cancer three [3] months ago and was buried<BR>
<BR>
here in South Africa. Prior to her death, she handed over to me a<BR>
<BR>
certificate meant for a secret deposit which my father made in a<BR>
<BR>
security/finance company in South Africa.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This deposit is worth [US $ 16.000.000.00] Sixteen Million United States =
Dollars only, and this money is in cash.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
My father made this deposit in the heat of the conflict then in my<BR>
<BR>
country, with the hope to convert it[money] to his personal use at the =
end<BR>
<BR>
of the war, unfortunately he was killed when the conflict =
intensified<BR>
<BR>
as result of his opposition to the rebel forces.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
After my mother's funeral, I contacted the security company to =
confirm<BR>
<BR>
this deposit and establish ownership as well made an arrangement for<BR>
<BR>
this deposit to be moved through diplomatic channel to United<BR>
<BR>
Arab Emirates Presently, this sum of U.S$16,000,000.00 (Sixteen million =
dollars) is<BR>
<BR>
currently being deposited in a security vault in Dubai. I am seeking<BR>
<BR>
for your honest and sincere participation in the retrievement and =
reinvestment of this<BR>
<BR>
money.<BR>
<BR>
I cannot do it alone due to my complete ignorance of the business<BR>
<BR>
world, more over I am only 27 years old I will give you a negotiable<BR>
<BR>
percentage of the principal sum in deposit if you assist me to retrieve =
and<BR>
<BR>
reinvest this money in any profitable area of business in your =
country.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Please, I need your assistance urgently, because the more this<BR>
<BR>
consignment is still with the company, the more the demurrage =
accumulates.<BR>
<BR>
Contact me through the same email address.<BR>
<BR>
God Bless You,<BR>
<BR>
Thanks yours<BR>
<BR>
Aliyu Mohamed.<BR>
