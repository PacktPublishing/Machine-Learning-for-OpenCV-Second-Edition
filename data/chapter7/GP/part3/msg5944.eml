<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Hello, my name me'Julie. I am from Houston Texas, born =
and raised right here. I go to school near by and I am a big fan of =
football. I am actually a cheerleader in school for our school team red =
bears, you might of heard of them. Well anyway's, I was hoping to get =
off on my webcam and wanted to see if you would like to join me. I love =
what I do, and I will never change, I haven't told my parents yet =
and&nbsp; hopefully they will not find out any time soon!.. The thing =
is, my privet cam isn[t so privet, because its free ;D, just hope my dad =
