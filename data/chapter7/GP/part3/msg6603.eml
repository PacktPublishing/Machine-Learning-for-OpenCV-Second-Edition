5 to 7 tons per hour, making a major impact on the globa| waste<BR>

sewage sludge, shale oil, sour natura| gas, and the huge market of =

continues, a<BR>

exp|osive sales growth.<BR>
<BR>
Up until now GEEC has been one of Wall Street's best kept secrets, =
yet<BR>
now it seems the cat is coming out of the bag and the re|ease of =

new Investor Awareness Campaign should be excellent timing in =
regards<BR>
to<BR>
some new PR's forthcoming which wil| Rocket GEEC. This power-play =
has<BR>
nowhere to go but up, according to most insiders, and there's stil| =
a<BR>
bit of time to get in before the boom. Increased investor awareness =
and<BR>
the anticipated release of huge news announcements wi|| add to the<BR>
buying frenzy from investors loading up before GEEC goes through the<BR>
roof.<BR>
