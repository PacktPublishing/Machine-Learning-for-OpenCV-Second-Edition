<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SOLICITING FOR =
ASSISTAN.<BR>
ATTEN:<BR>
Sir,<BR>
I hope you will not receive this proposal too surprising. I got your =
contact E-<BR>
mail address in the Internet while searching for a trustworthybusiness =
partner who<BR>
I can entrust a reasoning amount of money on his or her care for =
investment. I am<BR>
a Liberian and a cabinet member of PresidentCharles Taylor's =
administration.I am<BR>
presently in Nigeria under political asylum status because of the on =
going war in<BR>
Liberia. For your information I have secured and sent abroad the sum of =
Fifteen<BR>
Million US Dollars (US$15million) through diplomatic means. Due to my =
inability to<BR>
transfer these funds via the bank, I had them concealed properly in a =
trunk<BR>
consignment and moved undercover as Gold &amp; Diamonds trunck.<BR>
<BR>
The consignment is presently under the custody of a finance security =
company in<BR>
oversea.The money was originally meant for the purchase of arms and =
ammunition to<BR>
fight the rebel groups in Liberia but from thelook of things it is like =
we cannot<BR>
continue with the war because of the intervention of President George =
Bush of<BR>
America. As a result of the present development I now send the =
consignment (money)<BR>
abroad for my personal investment without the knowledge of our =
Government. My main<BR>
purpose of writing you is to seek your partnership if you could make =
claim of the<BR>
consignment from the security company as the new beneficiary for the =
benefit of<BR>
both us. I am willing to discuss sharing ratio in any reliable business =
you would<BR>
embark. Details of how you are going to claim the money from the =
security company<BR>
shall be made know to you as soon as you indicate your interest in =
this<BR>
transaction. Please treat this proposal with utmost<BR>
confidence and send me your information:<BR>
1. Full legal names and contact address<BR>
2. Direct (mobile) phone and fax numbers<BR>
As soo as you developed your interest by sending the above information I =
shall<BR>
send you&nbsp; all the documents and direction how to recieve the fund =
from the<BR>
security company in oversea, Sir I really care to entrust this =
consignment to you<BR>
if only you shall proof your integrite to me and , I hope you we not =
betray me<BR>
when this deal is done.<BR>
I need your urgent response through this =
E-mail:james_abraham1999@yahoo.co.uk<BR>
Thanks<BR>
Yours faithfully,<BR>
MR JAMES ABRAHAM.<BR>
