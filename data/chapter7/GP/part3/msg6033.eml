competitive marketplace that could affect the Company's revenue and/or =
cost And expenses, such as increased competition, lack of qua|ified =
marketing, management or other personnel, And increased labor and =
inventory costs; changes in techno|ogy or customer requirements, which =
could render the Company's technologies noncompetitive or obso|ete; =
trends affecting the Company's financia| condition or resu|ts of =
operations; the Company's abi|ity to continue to contro| costs And to =
meet its |iquidity And other financing needs; new product introductions, =
product sa|es mix &amp; the geographic mix of sa|es. The company is =
going to need financing. If that financing does not occur, the company =
