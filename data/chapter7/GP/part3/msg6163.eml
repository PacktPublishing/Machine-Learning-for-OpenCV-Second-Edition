How're you doing?


<br><br>Being famous was extremely disappointing for me. When I became =
famous it was a complete drag and it is still a complete drag.



<br><br>Behold, I have refined thee, but not with silver I have chosen =
thee in the furnace of affliction. [Isaiah 48:10]


<BR><BR>Ours is an abiding faith in the cause of human freedom. We know =
it is God's cause.<br><br>The 1980s are to debt what the 1960s were to =
sex.  The 1960s left a hangover. So will the 1980s.<BR><BR>If one had =
but a single glance to give the world, one should gaze on =
Istanbul.<BR><BR>Let us raise a standard to which the wise and honest =
can repair the rest is in the hands of God.Those who haven't loved =
somebody else, more than they love themselves haven't even begun to live


<br><br>If you focus on results, you will never change. If you focus on =
change, you will get results.<BR>Diseases are the tax on pleasures.<BR>A =
picture is a poem without words.

<BR>Be true to your teeth and they won't be false to you.



<br>The habit of looking on the best side of every event is worth more =
than a thousand pounds a years.
<br><br>There is one principle that can keep a man in everlasting =
ignorance.  That is contempt prior to investigation.



<BR>For Forms of Government let fools contest whatever is best =
administered is best.



<br><br>Pity the selfishness of lovers: it is brief, a forlorn hope it =
is impossible.<br>We are given children to test us and make us more =
spiritual.



<BR><BR>The ambitious are forever followed by adulation for they receive =
the most pleasure from flattery.
<BR>I do not give money for just mere hopes.

<br>A writer is unfair to himself when he is unable to be hard on =
himself.
<br>The magic of the pen lies in the concentration of your thoughts upon =
one object.
<BR>You can't plow a field by turning it over in your mind.
<br>There are few successful adults who were not first successful =
children.

<br><br>The line of beauty is the line of perfect economy.
<br>I love those who do not know how to live for today.<BR>Don't join =
the book burners. Do not think you are going to conceal thoughts by =
concealing evidence that they ever existed.
