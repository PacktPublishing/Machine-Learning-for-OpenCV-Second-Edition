i'm feeling very lonely lately, even though i'm a fun person and not
that bad lookin :/ feels like I will never find what I'm looking for
in life, does it ever happend to you ? my roomate Nikki is trying to
cheer me up by asking me to go to the club with her, but I feel like 
staying home today because I've been there so many times and it's not
as fun anymore.  If you feel like chatting with me come to my page:
