&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=
nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=
bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A PLEA FOR =
ASSISTANCE<BR>
Dear Sir\Madam,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
You may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not =
know me<BR>
personally, the purpose of my introduction is that, I am George Garba, =
the<BR>
first son of Mr. Pedro Garba, who was recently murdered in the land =
dispute<BR>
in Zimbabwe.&nbsp; I got your contact through network online hence&nbsp; =
decided to<BR>
write&nbsp; you.<BR>
<BR>
Before the death of my father, he had taken me to Johannesburg to =
deposit<BR>
the sum of US$20Million<BR>
(Twenty Million United States Dollars), in one the private security =
company,<BR>
as if he foresaw the looming<BR>
danger in Zimbabwe.&nbsp; This money was deposited in a box as germ =
stones to<BR>
avoid much demurrage from Security Company.&nbsp; This amount was meant =
for the<BR>
purchase of new machines and chemicals for the farms and established of =
new<BR>
farm in Swaziland.<BR>
<BR>
This land problem came when Zimbabwean President Mr. Robert Mugabe =
introduce<BR>
a new Land Act reform which wholly affected the rich white farmers and =
some<BR>
few blacks farmers.And&nbsp; this resulted to the killing and mob action =
by<BR>
Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society.&nbsp; In fact, =
a lot of<BR>
people was killed because of this land reformed Act for which my father =
was<BR>
one of the victim.<BR>
<BR>
It is against this background that, I and my family who are =
currently<BR>
staying in South Africa decided to<BR>
transfer my father s money to foreign account since the law of South =
Africa<BR>
prohibit a refugee (asylum<BR>
seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial<BR>
transaction througout the teritorial<BR>
zone South Africa.&nbsp; As the eldest son of my father, I am saddle =
with the<BR>
responsibility of seeking a genuine<BR>
foreign account where this money could be transferred without the =
knowledge<BR>
of my government who are bent from taking everything we have got.&nbsp; =
The South<BR>
African government seems to be playing along with them.&nbsp; I am faced =
with the<BR>
dilemma of investing this amount of money in South Africa for fear of =
going<BR>
through the same experience in future since both countries have =
similar<BR>
political history.&nbsp; Moreover, the South African Foreign Exchange =
policy does<BR>
not allow such investment as an asylum seeker.<BR>
<BR>
As a businessman, who I have to entrust my future and of my family in =
his<BR>
hands, I must let you know that this transaction is risk free.&nbsp; If =
you<BR>
accept to assist me and my family all I want you to do for me is to =
make<BR>
arrangements and come to Johannesburg&nbsp;&nbsp; South Africa, so that =
you can open a<BR>
non-resident account which will aid us in transferring the money into =
any<BR>
account you will nominate overseas.&nbsp; This money I intend to use =
for<BR>
investment.<BR>
<BR>
I have two options for you, firstly you can choose to have certain<BR>
percentage of the money for nominating your account for this =
transaction.&nbsp;<BR>
Or you can go into partnership with me for the proper profitable =
investment<BR>
of the money in your country.&nbsp; Whichever the options you want, feel =
free to<BR>
notify me I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of =
expenses<BR>
incurred in the process of this transaction. If you do not prefer a<BR>
partnership I am willing to give you 25% of the money while the =
remaining<BR>
70% will be for my investment in your country.<BR>
<BR>
Contact me with the above telephone E-mail or Telephone number while =
I<BR>
implore you to maintain the<BR>
absolute secrecy required in this transaction.<BR>
<BR>
Yours Faithfully,<BR>
<BR>
GEORGE&nbsp; GARBA.<BR>
(For the Family)<BR>
