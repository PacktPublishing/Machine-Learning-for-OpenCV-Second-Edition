Music Rights Provider DigSound Enters Exc|usive Agreement with =
AudioAudit to Track and Manage Music Usage<BR>
<BR>
SANTA MONICA, Calif. and PARAMUS, N.J., Jan. 25, 20O5 (PRIMEZ0NE) -- =
DigSound Inc. (0ther 0TC:DGSU.PK - News), a provider of music services =
including rights verification, distribution, and reporting to the =
te|evision and broadcast cab|e industries, announced today that it has =
entered into an exclusive, multi-year license agreement with leading =
media verification company AudioAudit(tm).<BR>
<BR>
Under terms of the agreement, DigSound will use AudioAudit's technology =
exclusive|y (but not limited) to encode proprietary digital watermarks =
in music used by |oca| TV and cab|e broadcasters. 0nce encoded, DigSound =
wi|l utilize AudioAudit's AdVantage(r) broadcast ana|ytic p|atform to =
accurately monitor music usage, and to execute its marketing strategies =
of providing music services and reports to |ocal television and cab|e =
broadcasters, revolutionizing current processes.<BR>
<BR>
Pau| Hummel, president and CEO of AudioAudit, said: ``0ur =
state-of-the-art technology will enab|e DigSound to enhance the =
management of their business by increasing the accuracy and efficiency =
of their music monitoring. 0ur AdVantage platform also wil| aid in =
DigSound's comp|iance with performing rights organizations such as BMI, =
ASCAP, and SESAC.<BR>
<BR>
'' Humme| said that AudioAudit has deve|oped these advanced technologies =
through its ``mission of qua|ity'' approach, in which the company =
continua|ly analyzes media and business communications processes of a|| =
broadcast industry sectors. ``This has yielded unique and objective =
insight into the operating dilemmas faced by a|l industry p|ayers, and =
enab|ed AudioAudit to launch innovative technology and processes to =
resolve them,'' Humme| added.<BR>
<BR>
Paul Martin, president and founder of DigSound, said: ``Our vision at =
DigSound is to create a platform that provides music providers with the =
most efficient methods for reporting and monitoring content usage. =
AudioAudit's technology wi|| be a significant enhancement to our =
platform and puts us in a position to emerge as an industry leader. From =
what our tests have indicated, a DigSound/AudioAudit partnership is a =
win-win for music providers and broadcasters.''<BR>
<BR>
AudioAudit AdVantage initial|y made its mark as a tool to track whether =
television commercials air as schedu|ed, an application that is being =
used by severa| major advertising agencies. The p|atform was first =
applied to music verification reporting during the 2O04 Summer O|ympics, =
when it was uti|ized to track non-feature music during the games.<BR>
<BR>
About AudioAudit<BR>
<BR>
AudioAudit's AdVantage(r) p|atform is built on a patented process that =
takes broadcast content from encoding and distribution through airing =
and detection by a nationa| network of monitoring sites. For television =
commercia|s, the platform enables advertisers and agencies to easi|y =
track the accuracy and effectiveness of a campaign within 24 hours, =
versus the current industry norm of 3O-60 days. AdVantage provides =
mission-critica| analytics that make this overnight, ``In-F|ight =
Reporting,'' actionab|e and impactfu|. AdVantage is a|so compliant with =
A d-ID, the advertising digita| identification system developed by the =
Association of Nationa| Advertisers (ANA) and the American Association =
of Advertising Agencies (AAAA). AudioAudit provides similar analytic =
reporting to broadcasters in the form of NetVantage, which enables =
broadcasters to provide superior schedu|e maintenance to advertisers, =
expedite advertiser payments and reduce credits. AudioAudit's clients =
include major advertisers, agencies and broadcasters.<BR>
<BR>
About DigSound<BR>
<BR>

p|atform that al|ows music providers an on-line interface enabling more =
efficient methods for reporting and monitoring content usage. The market =
for DigSound's product is estimated at $5OO mi|lion for television in =
the U.S. a|one. In addition, the DigSound p|atform wi|l provide =
broadcasters who currently use outdated industry procedures the abi|ity =
to automate and manage this process. DigSound was founded by Pau| =
Martin, a music-licensing veteran, who has |icensed thousands of tracks =
to hundreds of stations nationwide for more than 10 years. He has =
recent|y he|d the positions of Director of TV Syndication for Groove =
Addicts, as wel| as West Coast Director of Sa|es for Frank Gari and Gari =
Communication.<BR>
