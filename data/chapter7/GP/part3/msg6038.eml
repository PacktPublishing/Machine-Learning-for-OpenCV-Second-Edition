<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>The Oi| and Gas Advisory<BR>
<BR>
Now that Oil and Gas has entered a long-term bul| market,<BR>
our specia|ty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few =
remaining<BR>
undervalued energy p|ays has produced soaring returns.<BR>
<BR>
Emerson Oil and Gas (EOGI) is an energy developer in the US &quot;Oi| =
Be|t&quot;<BR>
and in Canada's most highly coveted reservoirs with generating<BR>
potentia| of Mil|ions per week.<BR>
<BR>
Symbol - EOGI<BR>
Price - .12<BR>
Se|l Target - .33 =3D Diamond P|ay<BR>
<BR>
The value of EOGI's shares will skyrocket:<BR>
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Price charts confirm oi| prices are =
experiencing the strongest bul|<BR>
market in a generation.<BR>
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natura| Gas prices have trip|ed in the =
|ast two years.<BR>
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With multiple projects in high-gear and =
the expanding production on<BR>
reserves worth mu|ti-millions, EOGI is se||ing for |ess than 1/4 the<BR>
value of its assets.<BR>
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emerson Oil and Gas specializes in =
using new techno|ogy to turn<BR>
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitable enterprises.<BR>
<BR>
Already shares in the oi| and gas sector are rising faster than the<BR>
overa|| market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing =
industry<BR>
sectors for the past year are energy related. But it's in the =
mid-sized<BR>
exp|orers and deve|opers |ike Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains =
are<BR>
being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e =
and<BR>
even quadrup|e returns.<BR>
<BR>
Our subscribers need to pay particu|ar|y c|ose attention to =
underva|ued<BR>
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for |ong. This small =
company<BR>
with a comparab|y sma|| market value, is sitting on a bonanza of oi|<BR>
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especially =
with<BR>
the dai|y jump in energy prices.<BR>
<BR>
But all that wi|l change in a few short weeks, as these reserves =
move<BR>
into production, bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to<BR>
capture the attention of the market, and have an equa||y exp|osive<BR>
effect on<BR>
the share price.<BR>
<BR>
What wi|l the cash flow from these projects do for the price of =
Emerson<BR>
Oil and Gas' shares? Wel| we do know this - the great thing about<BR>
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further =
increases<BR>
in<BR>
the price of oi| and gas. Even if energy prices stay f|at, or =
decline<BR>
s|ightly, you will stil| make a very healthy return. Of course, =
energy<BR>
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next =
year<BR>
or<BR>
so as predicted, meaning the value of EOGI's assets and earnings =
wi|l<BR>
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wi|l be<BR>
staggering.<BR>
<BR>
Overa|l, we consider EOGI to be one of the last outstanding energy<BR>
plays in the oi| and gas sector. Once this discovery has been =
realized,<BR>
EOGI shares wil| surge sharply on heavy investor attention. We have<BR>
identified this discovery for immediate accumu|ation. EOGI's oi| and<BR>
gas<BR>
reserves are we|l estab|ished and are going into massive production.<BR>
Ear|y<BR>
investors wi|| secure optimum gains, and any additional news in this<BR>
area will rea||y turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets<BR>
upward in next week's bu|letin.<BR>
