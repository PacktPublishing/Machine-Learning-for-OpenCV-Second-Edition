<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Hi!<BR>
<BR>
We have a new product that we offer to you, C_I_A_L_I_S soft tabs,<BR>
<BR>
Cialis Soft Tabs is the new impotence treatment drug that everyone<BR>
is talking about. Soft Tabs acts up to 36 hours, compare this to<BR>
only two or three hours of Viagra action! The active ingredient is<BR>
Tadalafil, same as in brand Cialis.<BR>
<BR>
Simply dissolve half a pill under your tongue, 10 min before sex,<BR>
for the best erections you've ever had!<BR>
<BR>
Soft Tabs also have less sidebacks (you can drive or mix alcohol<BR>
drinks with them).<BR>
<BR>
You can get it at: <A =
