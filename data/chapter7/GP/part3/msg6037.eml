Montana Oil and Gas, Inc.(MOGI) To Explore further opportunities in<BR>
Alberta Canada, is an energy deve|oper in Canada's most high|y =
coveted<BR>
reservoirs.<BR>
<BR>
Aggressive investors and traders may want to watch Montana Oi| and =
Gas<BR>
(MOGI.PK) again this morning! Montana Oil and Gas Inc. (MOGI - News)<BR>
announces that the Sy|van Lake oil and gas project is sti|| awaiting =
a<BR>
rig at this time. The surface lease has been constructed and we have<BR>
been waiting for a rig to become avai|ab|e for over two weeks, and<BR>
anticipate this to happen next week at the latest.<BR>
<BR>
The Company has a 25% working interest in the Sy|van Lake project.<BR>

<BR>
Reasons to consider MOGI:<BR>
<BR>
1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest =
bul|<BR>
market in a generation.<BR>
<BR>
2. Natura| Gas prices have tripled in the |ast two years.<BR>
<BR>
3. With multiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production =
on<BR>
reserves potential|y worth mu|ti-millions, MOGI is sel|ing for less<BR>
than 1/4 the va|ue of its assets.<BR>
<BR>
4. Montana Oi| and Gas specializes in using new technology to turn<BR>
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises. =
A|ready<BR>
shares in the oi| and gas sectorare rising faster than the overa||<BR>
market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry =
sectors<BR>
for the past year are energy related. But it's in the mid-sized<BR>
explorers and deve|opers like Montana Oi| (Mogi) that the biggest =
gains<BR>
are being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made =
trip|e<BR>
and even quadruple returns.<BR>

VANCOUVER, British Columbia, March 30, 2005 (PRIMEZONE) -- Montana =
Oil<BR>
and Gas, Inc., (Pink Sheets: MOGI) President Peter Sanders is please =
to<BR>
announce the following update on its Sylvan Lake project.<BR>
<BR>
After several delays due to unseasonable weather and road closures =
in<BR>
the Province of Alberta, the contracted drilling rig was moved onto<BR>
location over the weekend and Ensign Drilling has spudded the =
5-3-38-3<BR>
W5M well and are currently drilling at 1,250 feet. Surface casing will =
be run<BR>
to 930 feet. The drilling rig is known as a telescopic double and is =
rated<BR>
to drill to 10,000 feet in depth.&nbsp; Drilling operations are expected =
to<BR>
be suspended shortly for a few weeks as the County may impose a<BR>
restriction on heavy vehicles using secondary highways and roads =
during<BR>
spring breakup as heavy vehicles may cause severe road damage. This is =
an<BR>
annual event, which occurs in most of Central and Northern Canada when =
the<BR>
frost, which may be several feet thick comes out of the ground. =
Drilling<BR>
operations for a large rig such as the Sylvan Lake well requires service =
by heavy<BR>
vehicles such as mud, water, cement and vacuum trucks which will be<BR>
prohibited from using the roads during this period of time.&nbsp; Peter =
Sanders notes,<BR>
The road bans that have been taking place all over Alberta happen is<BR>
every year and in the spring is no surprise, all oil and gas =
companies<BR>
are effected by breakup, the good thing is, is that we have the rig =
on<BR>
site, which will remain there until we are finished drilling, surface =
casing has<BR>
been completed and we will be ready to finish drilling the minute the =
road<BR>
bans are lifted&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
The Sylvan Lake Prospect is a well defined 3-D seismic structural =
high<BR>
within a preserved Pekisko remnant !??island!?L that may have virgin<BR>
reservoirs with similar production potential as the adjacent N Pool<BR>
where 6 wells have produced 680,000 barrels oil since 1997. In overall, =
the<BR>
Sylvan Field has produced 40 million barrels of oil from the Pekisko =
formation and<BR>
50 billion cubic feet of gas from the Shunda formation.<BR>
<BR>
Ensign Drilling will test a total of 30 feet from several zones in =
the<BR>
Shunda formation at 7,155 feet and a 30-foot Pekisko oil formation =
at<BR>
7,320 feet. When drilling resumes, the hole is planned to reach a total =
depth<BR>
of 7,570 feet, which may take some 10 days to then complete drilling =
and<BR>
testing.<BR>
<BR>
Each development well has probable production of 150 barrels of oil =
per<BR>
day and 750?thousand cubic feet gas per day with reserves in excess =
of<BR>
1 billion cubic feet gas and 300,000 barrels of oil. There are four =
other<BR>
pay zones that are prospective for gas. The average well in the Sylvan =
Lake<BR>
Field has produced 500 barrels of oil per day and/or over one million =
cubic<BR>
feet of gas per day. If successful, the company intends to drill up to 4 =
more wells<BR>
on these land sections.&nbsp; This immediate area has been developed for =
both oil and<BR>
natural gas over the past forty-five years. Accordingly a multitude =
of<BR>
gas gathering and processing facilities and oil transportation =
facilities<BR>
have been<BR>
constructed.<BR>
