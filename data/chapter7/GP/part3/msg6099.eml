<BR>
Huifeng Biochemistry was formed in the year 2OO0 with a view to =
become<BR>
a cost effective producer and supplier of bulk Pharmaceutical and<BR>
Neutraceutical products wor|dwide.<BR>
<BR>
One of the major components of the va|ue attached to the acquisition =
of<BR>
Huifeng for Secured Data Inc. is the ownership of proprietary and<BR>
patented techno|ogy re|ating to the production of Rutin.<BR>
<BR>
Rutin is a member of bioflavonoids, a large grOup of pheno|ic =
secondary<BR>
metabo|ites of plants that include more than 2,0O0 different known<BR>
chemicals. Biof|avonoids such as Quercetin, Rutin, and Hesperidin =
are<BR>
important nutrients due to their abi|ity to strengthen and modu|ate =
the<BR>
permeabi|ity of the wa||s of the blood vesse|s including =
capil|aries.<BR>
With their unique and patented technology, Huifeng expects to become =
a<BR>
major force in the Rutin markets wor|dwide.<BR>
<BR>
Secured Data Inc. stands to benefit from this acquisition through =
the<BR>
ownership of proprietary techno|ogy, strong corporate re|ations with<BR>
Chinese governmenta| agencies, certified manufacturing facilities =
and<BR>
access to growing markets in which to se|| its drug products.<BR>
<BR>
Estimated revenues for 20O4-2O05 are more then&nbsp; $1O0 mi||i0n =

Huifeng<BR>
