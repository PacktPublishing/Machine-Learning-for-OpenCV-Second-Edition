Record Sales In 2004&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This week SMSNewsNetwork =
explores the SMS industry in China's business sector.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;According to In-Stat, China is currently the world's =
fastest-growing telecom market. In fact, &lt;strong&gt;China is the =
world's # 1 cellular market&lt;/strong&gt;, with 320 million users, =
already surpassing the U.S. subscriber base of less than 170 million, as =
reported by the Cellular Telecommunications &amp;amp; Internet =
Association. &lt;strong&gt;The Chinese SMS market alone accounts for =
1/3rd of the world's traffic &lt;/strong&gt;. SMS means sending and =
receiving brief text messages via mobile phones. SMS can be used for =
everything from promotional marketing to mobile banking. &lt;/p&gt;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;p =
align=3D&quot;justify&quot;&gt; One company SMSNewsNetwork believes has =
remarkable potential is the U.S. corporation, China Mobility Solutions, =
Inc., publicly traded on the OTC BB Exchange under the symbol =
&lt;strong&gt;CHMS.OB. &lt;/strong&gt;With a rapidly growing client base =
of over 15,000 Chinese companies, including profit-sharing contracts =
with China's largest telecom companies, we predict &lt;strong&gt;CHMS.OB =
&lt;/strong&gt; is positioned to become China's leading SMS provider for =
commercial customers. &lt;/p&gt;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;p =
align=3D&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHMS.OB &lt;/strong&gt; is =
currently trading below US$1.00, which we believe makes it an =
undiscovered investment gem. We give &lt;strong&gt;CHMS.OB =
&lt;/strong&gt; our highest rating of 10 out of 10.&lt;/p&gt;<BR>
