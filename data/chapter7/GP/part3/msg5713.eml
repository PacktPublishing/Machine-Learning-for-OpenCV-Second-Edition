we all
    have the same completely logical expectations prices would only =
change when
    quarterly reports or relevant news was released. This would make =
investing
    easy.</span></p>
    <p class=3DMsoNormal><span =
style=3D'font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Arial;
    color:#333333'>Technical analysis (TA) is the process of analyzing a
    security's historical prices in an effort to determine probable =
future
    prices. We compare current price action (current expectations) with
    comparable historical price action to predict a reasonable outcome. =
</span></p>

style=3D'font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Arial;
    color:#333333'>Only a small minority of technicians can consistently =
and
    accurately determine future prices. However, even if you are unable =
to
    accurately forecast prices, technical analysis can be used to =
consistently
    reduce your risks and improve your profits.</span></p>
    <p class=3DMsoNormal><span =
style=3D'font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Arial;
    color:#333333'>The price of a security represents a consensus - one =
person
    is buying and another is selling. The price at which an investor is =
willing
    to buy or sell depends primarily on his expectations. If he expects =
the
    security's price to rise, he will buy it; if the investor expects =
the price
    to fall, he will sell it. TA is based almost entirely on the =
analysis of
    the resulting price and volume as evidenced via a chart. A picture =
truly is
    worth a thousand words. </span></p>
    <p class=3DMsoNormal><span =
style=3D'font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Arial;
    color:#333333'>Think of security prices as the result of a =
head-to-head
    battle between a bull (the buyer) and a bear (the seller). The bulls =
push
    prices higher and the bears push prices lower. The direction prices
    actually move reveals who is winning the battle. </span></p>
    <p class=3DMsoNormal><span =
style=3D'font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Arial;
    color:#333333'>Support and resistance areas form where strong
    &quot;emotions&quot; occur, and can be penetrated by a change in =
investor
    expectations (a shift of the supply/demand lines). This type of a =
change is
    often abrupt and &quot;news based&quot;, and often =
emotional.</span></p>
    <p class=3DMsoNormal><span =
style=3D'font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Arial;
    color:#333333'>A trend represents a consistent change in prices =
(changing
    investor expectations). Trends differ from support/resistance levels =
in
    that trends represent change, whereas support/resistance levels =
represent
    barriers to change.</span></p>
    <p class=3DMsoNormal><span =
style=3D'font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Arial;
    color:#333333'>The use of TA, essentially observing the clues and =
actions
    of the &quot;crowd&quot;, allows you to divorce yourself from what
    &quot;they&quot; are feeling. Somewhat clinically, you are in a =
position to
    anticipate their actions and so act either ahead, with or counter to =
the
    crowd - providing a much more timely (higher probability) basis for
    investment decisions.</span></p>
    <p class=3DMsoNormal><span =
style=3D'font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Arial;
    color:#333333'>TA provides a basis or frame of reference using a =
logical
    and consistent approach that minimizes risks and maximizes =
opportunities.
    Most investors spend their time looking for easy money (which is not =
an
    easy search) instead of learning the key factors to security =
prices--supply
    and demand. </span></p>
