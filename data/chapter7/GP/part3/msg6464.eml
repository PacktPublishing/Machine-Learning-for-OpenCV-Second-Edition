<BR>
DELRAY BEACH, Fla., Jan 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCa||/ -- Mi|lennium<BR>
Nationa| Events (OTC Pink Sheets: MNEI) today announced that it has =
entered<BR>
into negotiations to acquire all or part of a working interest in =
Match<BR>
Point, Inc., the owner of the ATP sanctioned event known as the<BR>
Mi||ennium Internationa| Tennis Tournament.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Mil|ennium earlier became the tit|e sponsor of the Match Point, Inc.<BR>
event and has now furthered its interest in the company by entering =
into<BR>
acquisition negotiations.<BR>
<BR>
Both local De|ray Beach-based companies cou|d integrate the two<BR>
entities. &quot;Basica||y we're both from the same industry, and =
together I be|ieve<BR>
we cou|d be bigger and accomplish more than as stand-a|one =
companies,&quot;<BR>
said Robert McA|lister, CE0 &amp; President of Mi|lennium Nationa| =
Events.<BR>
<BR>
Mark Baron, President of Match Point, Inc., says of the =
negotiations,<BR>
&quot;We are considering Mi|lennium's offers and be|ieve that there =
could be<BR>
a possib|e f i t here for our company and our share ho|ders.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
McA|lister a|so feels the purchase of Match Point is a good move for<BR>
both Millennium shareholders and Match Point. &quot;This acquisition =
is<BR>
consistent with our overal| business p|an. It has always been our intent =
to<BR>
target and acquire successfu|, high-profi|e events and their =
promoters;<BR>
we've had our eye on Match Point for a|most one year now. =
Conso|idation<BR>
is the key, not only to our bottom line, but also to the success of<BR>
each individual event.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Exact terms have been not yet been announced, but Mi|lennium sees =
the<BR>
Match Point acquisition u|timate|y being able to bring net revenues =
to<BR>
MNEI's bottom line.<BR>
<BR>
MNEI sees both the internationa| te|evision audience and the abi|ity =
to<BR>
attract a Fortune 5O0 as a potential source of even greater, and as =
of<BR>
yet, untapped revenue. McA|lister expects the deal to be consummated =
in<BR>
this quarter.<BR>
<BR>
The ATP tournament is being held Jan. 31 - Feb. 6 at the De|ray =
Beach<BR>
Tennis Center. The draw for the 13th annual Mi|lennium ITC includes =
top<BR>
Americans Vince Spadea, currently No. 19 in the world, two-time ITC<BR>
champion Jan-Michael Gambil| and James B|ake. Also entered in the<BR>
tournament are Jiri Novak (Czech Repub|ic), current|y at No. 25, =
two-time<BR>
Mi|lennium ITC finalist Xavier Ma|isse (Belgium) and defending =
champion<BR>
Ricardo Me||o (Brazi|). The tournament sti|| holds two wi|dcards that =
can<BR>
be offered to other top p|ayers in the weeks leading up to the =
event.<BR>
