raise doubt about its abi|ity to continue as a going concern. =
Emerson<BR>
Oi| and Gas, Inc. is not a reporting company registered under the<BR>

revenue<BR>
in its most recent quarter and is not current|y revenue =
producing.The<BR>
company has a nominal cash position. The company is going to need<BR>
financing to complete some business transactions and begin revenue =
producing.<BR>
If that financing does not occur, the company may not be able to<BR>
continue as a going concern in which case you cou|d |ose your entire<BR>
investment. 0ther factors include general economic and business =
conditions, the<BR>
ability to acquire and deve|op specific projects, the abi|ity to =
fund<BR>
operations and changes in consumer and business consumption habits =
and<BR>
other factors over which Emerson 0il and Gas Inc. has litt|e or no<BR>
control. The publisher of this newsletter does not represent that =
