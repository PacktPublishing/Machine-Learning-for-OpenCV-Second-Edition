We need to run a little project over the next week or so.

I think it is time that you have someone inventory all the projects you have going in your group, sit down and go over them with me and then you and I make sure they still have support from a business unit or make sense at all.  Some of them involve IT resources and some don't.

I just want to take a breath for a moment and make sure every project you are doing (outside the daily operations that are so critical) is necessary and still has a sponsor at a business unit.  If not, we can stop several side projects and focus on the critical ones, save some money and make sure we get the 5 to 10 things that absolutely have to be done completed.

Your thoughts?
