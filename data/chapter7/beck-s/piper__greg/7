Let's meet in the next few days to discuss this issue of other groups selling 
your services as long as you are the desk, get to price and structure all the 
deals and make your quote with an appropriate margin in every deal.  Clearly 
we would have to initially put together a product menu for the EA group so 
they can understand what they are pitching as well as designate a person from 
your group to work with them so that the story gets told accurately to the 
potential customers.

Thanks.
