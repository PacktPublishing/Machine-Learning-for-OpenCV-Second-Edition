Carol, thanks.

Anne:  we need to send this list to AEP to ensure they agree that this is the extent of our "Books and Records" obligations at Close.

Thanks,
Brian

Sally and Brian,
Per my conversation with Brian regarding HPL books and records to be turned over to AEP, we will complete the identification and inventory report of records to be turned over by close of business Thursday, April 26, 2001.  We will continue to track and monitor the location of these records during the transition of personnel from Enron to AEP.  In order to ensure delivery of the HPL/AEP Records Transfer List, we have increased the resources from three to ten individuals.

Please call me if you need further clarification or have any comments or concerns.

Thank you,
Carolyn Gilley
