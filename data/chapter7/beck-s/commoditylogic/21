These guys are using the technology we saw last week from OnExchange.  Amerex 
called me today to ask us to participate or (if we deemed it necessary) to 
take the lead in this project.  As always, James has the competitor info 
database on this stuff.  Please copy him on all material like this.

All the best,

Tom

Sounds like this .com will be a direct competitor for FIX and maybe even 
FMM.   We need to watch for more details.
