Leslie Reeves is working on the Tom Gros project (let me know if you need 
details on this).  She has asked for top 25 counterparties on EnronOnline.   
In short, there is a new Texas law in the works that will allow for 
electronic confirming of deals, and they want to determine if any of the top 
25 are Texas companies so that we can pursue confirming deals 
electronically.  

Just wanted to get your approval before sending it on to her.

thanks

Attached is the top 25 deal count C/P for EnronOnline for US Gas & US Power.
This is what I will forward to Leslie Reeves once I get the OK from Louise or 
Sally through you.

Leslie Reeves will be working with Mary Solmonson to identify which of these 
counter-parties reside in the state of Texas.

Just let me know when I can forward this to Leslie.
Thanks.
