Sally,

First of all, allow me to express my congratulations for your promotion. I am 
following up on the conversation about structuring of the Commodity Logic 
initiatives you had with Greg Piper last week. How do you think we should go 
about looking into the projects? I remain at your disposal for any direction 
you might want to follow.
