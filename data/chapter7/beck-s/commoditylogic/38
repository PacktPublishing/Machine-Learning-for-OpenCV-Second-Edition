Sally,
FYI, attached is a memo from Valtech who helped us building EOL.  The 
architect worked on EOL project is available and he is one of the most 
technical and expensive person ($2,000/day which is approximately half of 
Diamond group's cost)  who we can use during the start up phase. Thank you. 
       Best wishes,
       Inja

Inja,

Per the conference call today I am confident that we can add value to the
Commodity Logic Project. I base this on the success of Enron Online and
Valtech's role of supporting that effort. Currently, We have the Architect
(David Jayakaran) that designed the presentation framework for EOL available
as part of the team. I mention this because of the obvious synergy between
the EOL framework and Commodity Logic. As discussed David will meet with you
on Wednesday. The action items I owe you are the Enron negotiated rate
structure and profiles for consultants that could start immediately. The
daily rates are senior consultants at $2,000 and consultants at $1,750.  The
profiles are attached for your review. Please contact me if you have any
questions.

Regards,

Martin
