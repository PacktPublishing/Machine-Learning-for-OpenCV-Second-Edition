So far, we have not done any further testing on ConfirmLogic since early last week when we encountered the problems with the volume and price displays.  Kathryn called me late on Friday and said that they would let us know when we can resume testing.  We have not heard from them this morning.

Their demo last Thursday for the Beta Clients went well.  The customers that participated in the demo were Reliant, Dynegy, Calpine, and Sempra (Sempra participated via Video Conference from Enron's New York Office.)  Dynegy immediately said that they were very interested and I heard that Reliant called back and expressed their interest as well.

I will keep you posted on any further developments.
