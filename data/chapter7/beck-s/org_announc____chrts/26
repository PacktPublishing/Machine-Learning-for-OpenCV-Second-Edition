This morning, we announced an offer to acquire London-based MG plc, one of=
=20
the world=01,s leading metals marketers, for $446 million.  We have been=20
monitoring the global metals market for several years, and we believe that=
=20
now is the right time to enter this $120 billion market.  We are confident=
