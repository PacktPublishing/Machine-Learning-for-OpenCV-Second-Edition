In an effort to streamline the corporate center and in recognition of the=
=20
growing capabilities of Enron=01,s regional Wholesale Business, Global Asse=
t=20
Operations will be reorganized effective 1 May 2000.  Our current Global=20
Asset Operations functions will be decentralized and become a business unit=
=20
responsibility.
Enron will continue to operate all of its facilities under standardized=20
guidelines and procedures and compliance will be monitored through a formal=
=20
audit program as in the past.  However, our Wholesale Business Units will=
=20
assume responsibility for operation and management of their specific power=
=20
plants and other assets.
Operational Energy Corporation (OEC) will become the Enron Corp =01&Center =
of=20
Excellence=018 for power plant operations.  The Gas Pipeline Group is the C=
enter=20

=20
America.  Jim Noles will be in charge of this activity.  Mark Dobler will=
=20
lead operations; and John Cates will lead the Development Support Activity.=
 =20
John Cates=01, organization will continue to provide O&M estimates and due=
=20
diligence assistance to business units.  John will specifically approve O&M=
=20
estimates for corporate risk assessment decisions.  Jim Noles and this new=
=20
group will report to the Office of the Chairman in Enron North America.
The Quality Management Group (Audit Function) will be assigned to the Gas=
=20
Pipeline Group (GPG).  Don Hawkins will continue to head Quality Management=
=20
and will report to Phil Lowry, Managing Director, Operations, GPG. In=20
addition to managing the global audit program, Don will continue his=20
responsibility for standardized policies and procedures, the Crisis=20
Management Program, ISO 9000 certification, the Positive Impact Program,=20
operational reporting, and the Asset Operations Website.
The Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) Group led by Henry Van will repor=
t=20
to Mike Terraso, Enron=01,s Chief Environmental Officer reporting to Steve=
=20
Kean.  As in the past, Henry=01,s Group will continue to provide environmen=
tal=20
and safety support to the regional business units.
Enron=01,s Wholesale Business Unit=01,s can now choose from a variety of se=
rvices=20
provided by OEC.  These include full turnkey O&M services, O&M estimates, d=
ue=20
diligence, and technical support for planned and forced outages.  Business=
=20
units are encouraged to take advantage of these services as they operate an=
