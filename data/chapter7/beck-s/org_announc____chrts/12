DealBench

Enron Net Works' newest initiative is now online!  

The Product
DealBenchTM is an online platform that enables licensing companies to arrange 
and execute transactions  efficiently and effectively.  Companies that 
license DealBenchTM are able to organize their transaction materials, upload 
documents and other materials to a secure website, invite deal participants 
to view deal materials, host various types of online auctions and manage, 
track and close a transaction online.  
DealBenchTM incorporates five specific business tools that streamline the 
transaction process for licensees:
Document Sharing:   deal-related materials in various formats (Word, 
Powerpoint, Excel, CAD drawings, digital pictures,      etc.) can be uploaded 
for deal participants to view and/or edit.

Auctioning/Bidding:   licensees can design and monitor (in real-time) forward 
or reverse auctions and collect sealed tender      bids.

Multi-media:    customers can present high quality virtual road shows and 
asset descriptions using streaming video.

Secure Communication:  DealLineTM messaging system facilitates one-to-one, 
one-to-many, and many-to-many        communication.

Deal Management:   DealNotesTM  enables customers to monitor the progress of 
their deals using statistics on user      downloads, bidding/auction results 
and user page views.


Applications
DealBenchTM has been used by Enron during bank product syndications, the sale 
of a large portfolio of leases, and the procurement of certain materials for 
the new headquarters building.   Soon, DealBenchTM will also meet the 
collaboration needs of Enron attorneys, facilitate online RFQs and provide 
for the hosting of online datarooms.
