For the May 8th expanded staff meeting, I would like to include Kevin Heal 
(Lead, Logistics) and Dianne Seib (Sr. Specialist, Documentation) as well as 
Kathy Reeves who is currently my only direct report at the manager level.  
Kevin and Dianne provide a lot of leadership to their respective groups, and 
I think it would be very useful for them to hear what Beth has to say.  Do 
you think this will cause a problem given that you are restricting the 
Houston attendance?  Let me know your thoughts.

For the PRC meeting, I am currently planning to be in Houston June 15th and 
16th for the Global conference.  The best dates for me would be Tuesday, June 
13th or  Wednesday, June 14th, and I'll just come to Houston earlier than 
planned.  Let me know once you've finalized the date.

For the training, there are only three people in Energy Operations doing 
reviews.  The three are Kevin Heal, Kathy Reeves and me.  I don't know 
Norma's last name so would you mind forwarding this list to her.  I will talk 
to Dawn Doucet about the best way to coordinate the training.

Let me know if you have questions.
