We are set up for the meeting on Operational Risk on February 6th at 3:00 
pm.  We have a room booked at the Sheraton with a set up similar to the 
Houston meeting.  I have invited three people from the accounting department 
to attend as well.  Laura Scott, Cheryl Dawes, and Dave Hanslip will be the 
attendees from accounting.  Everyone is looking forward to meeting with you 
to discuss this issue.  So far, the weather is still mild.  Talk to you soon.
