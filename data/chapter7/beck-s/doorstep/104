Mike - thanks I got it eventually.

The only thing I would add at this stage would be under "Daily Management P&L 
and position reporting..."

"Key positional and valuation data delivered to corporate risk aggregation 
system ("RisktRAC") by a pre - determined time"

The form and content of that data I outlined in my last tome.

 

This will allow us to (amongst other things) get the positions aggregated and 
perform some level of assessment, and allow you folks to kill the spreadsheet 
you currently use to calculate VAR, because RisktRAC has the VAR engine.
