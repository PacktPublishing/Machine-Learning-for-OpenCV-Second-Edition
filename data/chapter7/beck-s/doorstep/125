Bill

Attached is a response to the main observations of  Project Doorstep.
I would be interested in your feedback.  As a note the Settlements Residue 
Position has recovered significantly and we will  end the quarter with 
liquidations 
approximately $3k under the forward value or a 6% variation.  Importantly, we 
are in the black and heading the right way!

Thnx
paul
