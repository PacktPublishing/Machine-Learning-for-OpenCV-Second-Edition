Dear Ken,

I'm going to be in St. Louis and Chicago the next couple of days.  Could you 
let me know what your thoughts are re the message below today so I can plan 
the rest fo my week?  The report is now really late.

Regards

Dear Ken,

Just to ensure I understand, it seems you have taken yourself out of the 
report writing process.  I reviewed the Portland report you sent earlier 
today and didn't see any changes. I thought you were going to call Leslie 
about getting the info from her and taking a look at it. 

Please let me know what you understand your responsibilities are as far as 
Portland is concerned.

Thanks

Shona

Dear Shona,

Actually, I am waiting on the deal test samples from Leslie (if this is still 
the game plan) before giving Jennifer the total package, which Jennifer 
understands.  She followed up with a call requesting a summary of findings in 
lieu of the working papers, at least for now.  She is calling me everyday, 
and I think it would be good to bring closure to this.  I have not heard 
anything from Leslie.  If you and Leslie are happy with the remainder of the 
deal test, I will x-ref the working papers as such, and we can ship the 
papers on to Jennifer.

Thanks, Shona!
Ken

Dear Ken,

She is actually asking for the deal test samples etc.  You need to give her 
this (I don't have any of it).

Thanks

Hi Shona,

Jennifer Stevenson (AA) left a voice mail in which she indicated that she was 
looking for a summary/recap of the Portland review.  Once the Portland report 
is finalized, would you forward her the information she requires?

Thank you,
Ken
