Upon further consideration, the ongoing responsibility of Doorstep activities 
will fall to the Market Risk (Ted Murphy et al) group within RAC. My original 
intention here was to streamline a costly and time consuming process and for 
whatever reason it seems the exact opposite goal has been achieved.  Please 
discontinue any activities related to this project. Thanks, Rick
