Dear Ken, Leslie,

It looks like we have gotten to the bottom of the missing documentation (it 
was there, it was quickly available, Ken did talk to the right people but 
they did not see the urgency of getting the information to Ken).  As a 
result, I think we have to rewrite the information related to this issue in 
the Portland report.  Let's get together for 15 minutes today/tomorrow to 
draft a rewrite of these areas.  

Just as a side note, we need to wait until the report has been changed before 
we share the information with Portland.

Pam - could you organize Ken, Leslie and I getting together?

Thanks

Shona
