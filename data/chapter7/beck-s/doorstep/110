Doug

The Doorstep team will wish to visit any MG trading locations in order to do 
deal testing.  In order to weed out the origination offices from trading 
offices we have agreed the following approach with Brent.  You were 
unanimously voted as the man to co-ordinate the effort.

1.  As there are various suitable (i.e. ex-auditors/risk controls) Enron 
people visiting certain offices, they will use the standard questionnaire 
(Brent should send this to you) in order to establish if the activity is of a 
trading nature.  These people (so far identified) are myself (Liverpool on 
Tuesday), Andy (Germany & US offices from 19th June), Lloyd Fleming (same as 
Andy) & Tani Nath (Korea & Singapore next week I believe).

2.  AA are internal auditor of MG.  I have arranged with Sarah Williams to 
get the MG internal audit manager to organise a meeting with you in order for 
you to review the audit plans and understand what they have reviewed, whether 
their internal audit includes deal testing, how they have already reviewed 
(or not) the remote offices.....  You should plan to report back to Andy, 
Brent & I on Friday (please could you organise the meeting).  I have the 
audit report for MGL & MGMCC audit is due to start on tuesday.

3.  Once we have clarified the extent of AAs work we will assess what else 
needs to happen and who to get in to the various different offices to 
complete the reviews.

Many thanks

Naomi
