Good, valid points.  I think that I agree that we should not have a tour=20
strictly for "control" purposes.  Ted, how do you feel about the concept of=
 a=20
general business tour on an annual basis that would touch on, but not solel=
y=20
focus on controls?

Dear R2:?I would like you to consider the following in determining the appr=
opriate ?course of action in your mission to ensure that all our offices ha=
ve process, ?procedures and policies to adequately support the business act=
ivities:??  I believe that your going on a series of trips is precisely the=
 wrong ?approach and not only do I think it will be relatively unproductive=
 (as ?compared to your tremendous productivity at home base) but I honestly=
 believe ?it will be counterproductive. Here's why:??   1) While you guys a=
re on a plane or in a remote office, you will be less ?in touch and availab=
le to make decisions at home?   2) When you are preparing to go and de-comp=
ressing from having been, you ?will be distracted, tired and attempting to =
catch up to all your     other ?duties.?   3) There are only two of you and=
 many of them.?   4) Please don't take this the wrong way, but I question w=
hether you even ?are the best qualified from a skill perspective (Kevin Swe=
eney,     Vlady ?Gorny, John Vickers, et al might be the best to dig into t=
he details)?   5) When you guys are the face, it means the rest of us are n=
ot.  This ?means that our presence and authority, which will be required on=
 ?    an on-going basis in order for this to have lasting effect, will be ?=
completely undermined.   Senior people need to know that if a ?    Sweeney,=
 Murphy, Hardy,  etc walks into their office and finds something ?not right=
, that it will be communicated up the line with     reprecussions.  ?If you=
 were to investigate anonomously, I believe that a universal theme is ?that=
 stuff gets pointed out and nothing     ever gets changed.  It puts those ?=
in the position of knowing on the defensive and sounding shrill.??My sugges=
tions is that you stay home.  Sally, AA myself and others should ?develop a=
 template for consistent analysis of the offices and a plan to ?maintain an=
 on-going pressure and results.  Part of that plan would be a ?requirement =
to report to you guys the findings and recommendations in a ?concise way  w=
ith you following up to the heads of those offices about what, ?if anything=
, needs to change as quickly as possible after the review.    ??The most im=
portant things you can do will be to pave the way for our ?departure, be av=
ailable to assimilate the findings and be prepared to ?follow-up.  Everyone=
 already knows that they need to respect your wishes.  ?They need to know (=
as do we) that we have your support and you will respect ?and act on our re=
commendations.  ??Thank you for indulging me.  I am afraid that I am correc=
t.?Ted??
