THIS MESSAGE IS BEING SENT OUT ON BEHALF OF GREG NIKKEL AND KIM LESLEY


Below is a summary of our activities this past week

Accomplishments:
Delivered workshops at NEPCO
Gained agreement with NEPCO on status of showstopper reports
Scheduled India' s workshops for next week
Rolled out (to NEPCO) the user manuals developed


Upcoming:
Complete gathering of data points and begin to layout longer term strategy 
(Elaine and Kim)
Develop additional workshops (design and data flow, consolidations and 
intercompany)
Develop and deliver second evaluation
Roll out manuals to user group in Houston 


Where are we at?
We should be able to ask more specific questions in our follow up evaluation 
to get better data on what specifically they don't like about the reporting 
out of SAP but as a rule so far we have consistently heard the issue of 
management quality reports, ability to pull data from across modules (ie. HR 
and PS data) and I can't get the data the way I want to see it therefore I 
don't understand what the data is telling me. 

This last point will be helped by these workshops (ability to view the data 
in mulitple ways) but only to the extent where people use the tools available 
and spend a little time to work with the system.  The design sessions 
(upcoming) should help address some of these questions aswell - one big 
learning from this has been that the majority of users do not understand 
their business unit design or the overall design and therefore can't figure 
out what the system data is telling them.  This is being addressed in the 7/1 
training plan and will also be addressed in the long term reporting strategy.

Thanks, again if you have any questions please contact Melissa, Greg or 
myself.

Kim Lesley
