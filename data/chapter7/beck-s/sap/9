We have continued to refine our approach to these workshops, and the

participants:  "On a scale of 1 to 10, how effectively did the workshop......
 1.  Help you learn something new?
 2.  Increase your comfort level with extracting data ?
 3.  Make SAP standard reporting more useful?
 4.  Use activities and discussions to contribute to your learning?
 5.  Better prepared to do your job?"
