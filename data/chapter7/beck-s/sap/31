Cindy,

At this time, Energy Operations is not prepared to sign off that SAP 
development for Energy Operations has been completed and that based on what 
was seen at user reviews all requirements have been met.  Having been in your 
position on other projects, I understand your need for this sign-off.  In an 
effort to focus both our teams on resolving and remaining outstanding issues, 
we can provide the following list of known items which remain unclear to us.

Mapping profit centers/books
Inability to unit test the power interface due to lack of profit center 
definition for power
AR reporting by product/coordinator/counterparty
Reversal of prepay accruals for Financial Settlements
Netting control point for AP
Reporting Entities (Co 842)
Report Requirements
Cash forecasting tools
Netting intercompany offsetting 3rd party (FX)
Monetizations
Controls on writeoffs
Flex file upload

Call Melissa at X35704 for detailed explanations.  I'm available as always at 
X33179.
