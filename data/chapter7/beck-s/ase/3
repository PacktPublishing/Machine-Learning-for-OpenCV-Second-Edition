Sally - 

Attached is a revised set of slides for the Final Report Out of group Wrench 
- the group that worked on Products/Services - Basic Outsourcing.  The 
hypertiles with the matrix of Product/Service, Issue and Timeline were not 
readable when shot with a digital camera; so, they created the content from 
the hypertiles in a Microsoft Word table.  I did not have that table this 
morning when I sent the other slides.

I am very sorry for the inconvenience this has caused you.
