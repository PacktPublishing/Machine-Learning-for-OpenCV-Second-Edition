Here is my list.  I also touched base with Brent, Bob, and Leslie to see who 
they wanted to include from their staff as well.

We're a little over the suggested max of 25 people.  I've made a call to Lisa 
Petruska to see if 25 is a firm number or if we can go a little over.  Please 
review and make and additions/deletions you see fit and then return.  I will 
send out the notice to get this on everyone's calendar once I have your 
updates.

I suggest we let each department handle flight arrangements, but that we 
centrally coordinate lodging.
