GBN Steering Committee Meeting, 09 April 2000

May 17th Speaker - no sponsor.
We decided against having a cover charge and to use GBN funds. We felt a 
cover might reduce attendance and wanted to keep the speaker series free for 
attendees. A $10 cover wouldn't cover all of the expenses anyway and we felt 
it would create a bad impression. Deed Vest of Rockwell International has 
confirmed availability for the date. Carolyn is handling the set up.

September 20th Houston's Economy Panel
Paul Murphy, Southwest Bank of Texas: confirmed with sponsorship
Shirley Delibero, Metro: unconfirmed, should hear something this week
Robert Duncan, Transwestern Real Estate: confirmed
Harvey Bunce, UT Galveston Med Center: unconfirmed
Technology: need someone. Roger, any interest at Compaq?
Energy: need someone. Sally, any interest at Enron?

Moderator: UT Professor Michael Brandl, Ph.D.

I will be contacting the TBN and see if they would also like to attend. This 
will be a GBN event, but we will invite the TBN.


June 25th Astros night v. San Francisco
According to Chrissy, the plans include a ticket to the? game, dinner at 
Zydeco's and a trolley ride from Zydeco's to the new Enron field. All this 
for only $25/person! Chrissy, if you have the info, let's try to get it on 
the May 17th event mailing.


Summer 2000 Family Event
Several members have expressed interest in a family event. Chrissy and I are 
looking into Theater Under The Stars (Miller Outdoor Theater). GBN will buy 
soft drinks and attendees will bring their own picnic dinner.

Next Meeting - Sunday, May 7th @ 4:30 pm at Guadalajara - the weekend before 
the Deed Vest event.

As you find out information for the events on which you are working, please 
email Chris and I to keep us up to date. Thank you for your help. Your work 
is appreciated.

Glenn.
