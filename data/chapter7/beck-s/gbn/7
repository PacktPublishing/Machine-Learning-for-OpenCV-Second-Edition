This is a reminder that we have a Houston GBN steering committee meeting this
Sunday, March 12th, at 4:30 pm at Guadalajara Restaurant on 59 between
Buffalo Speedway and Kirby.  Please let myself of Glenn know if you can make
it.

Hopefully, you have received invites or e-mails about the Steve Patterson
event on March 15th and the Houston Aeros game with the Texas Exes on March
31st.
