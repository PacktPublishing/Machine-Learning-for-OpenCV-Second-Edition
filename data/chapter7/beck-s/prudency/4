Please see the attached draft prudency policy and prudency schedule.  Barry=

I need your comments ASAP.   I am in meetings until around 11:00 tomorrow. =

I don't think we can argue that we no longer need prudency without it being=
 a=20
change in accounting policy.  This years Annual Report FN-3 stills contains=
=20
the following statement:

  The values are adjusted to reflect the potential impact of liquidating=20
Enron=01,s position in=20
  an orderly manner over a reasonable period of time under present market=
=20
conditions. =20

I think the best we can argue is 1)that the liquidity in some commodities=
=20
(gas for U.S. and maybe power for U.K.) has increased to a level that=20
prudency is no longer required and 2)setting a minimum level of VAR before=

prudency is required are not a wholesale change in our accounting policy. =

I have not attempted to address establishing an operational reserve.  I thi=
nk=20
the two are separate, but no reason why we can't create one this quarter.

Wes, I need to get with you to determine what ENA would like to do.  The=20
earnings situation may be different than expected.  ENA has taken a large=
=20
amount out of prudency (see the attached schedule).  We can probably argue=
=20
for that release to be reduced, pending complete research on power liquidit=
y=20
and implementation of the new RAC calculation.  I obviously will not hold a=
ny=20
discussions with AA. =20

Let me know what the next steps are.  I will be waiting to hear from you bo=
