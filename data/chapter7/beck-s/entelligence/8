I have Louise locked in for June 15th in the am.  Now I need your help in 
securing Rick Causey and Joe Sutton or Jeff Skilling.

Here is some information you will need when 'wooing' them.

The first annual Global Conference will be held at the Rice Hotel in downtown 
Houston on June 15th and June 16th.  The theme of the conference is 
'Foundations of "One Enron".'  A review of Global Data 
Management's(Counterparty, Contracts, Facilities, Rates, Entelligence) role 
in the development and support of central information regarding Enron's 
customers and relationships and plans for expanding that role will be 
discussed.  Many topics will re-inforce worldwide initiatives, communication 
between business units, and learning to leverage knowledge and expertise from 
multiple sources. There will also be a special workshop session on 
multi-cultural awareness to prepare our teams for working in a global 
environment.  

And then you say.....
"Mary and I would like to feature you as a distinguished speaker, so you may 
relate to Mary's team and conference attendees why consistent global 
information is so important to Enron.  What value does constancy of 
information bring to Enron....how will this information serve Enron ?  We 
would like you to inspire us and influence us to meet Enron's diverse set of 
challenges.    Take the freedom to express things you have learned and think 
are valuable lessons to share with others.  
We have guest speaker spots available on the following days and times

June 15  - 1:30 - 1:50                or 2:10 - 2:30                        
or 2:30 - 2:50

June 16 - 11:00 - 11:20 (before lunch)                       or 12:30 - 12:50 
(after lunch)

I would like to have you be the final keynote speaker on Friday, 6/16 from 
3:15 to 3:45 or so (time for questions).  After that there will be some door 
prizes, the video presentation, and a brief conference summary.  Then it's 
off to Enron Field !  We would be delighted to have you attend all of the 
conference, but if your schedule will not permit, we would love if you could 
remain with us throughout Friday afternoon and accompany us to Enron Field 
for a social event in the Diamond Club.

I appreciate your efforts to secure meaningful and well-respected speakers 
for this year's conference.  If you need assistance from me, just let me know.
