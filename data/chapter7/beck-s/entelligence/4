fyi - here are details on the approach Joel is taking to draft a strategic 
systems plan.  What he doesn't mention is that after the initial information 
gathering, we hope to synthesize and make recommendations for where more 
focus should occur, what projects should potentially be slowed or halted, 
what projects can be leveraged across multiple business units, and what new 
initiatives / technology should be initiated and explored.  In addition to 
Sally's direct reports, Joel also plans to make contact with other business 
units as well including Richard Sage in London.

Let me know if you have any comments or suggestions.

Greetings Sally!  During the next week and a half, we will begin the process 
of collecting information which will be used to write the Strategic Systems 
Plan.  Basically, the Strategic Systems Plan will be used to identify several 
areas of opportunity within each business unit such as:

Each business units overview and the role technology plays in their area
Current trends in each business area
Using technology to help you achieve corporate goals/objectives
Current departmental/business unit goals
Using technology help you achieve departmental goals/objectives
Projected business growth in twelve (12) to eighteen (18) months?
Current technology being used
Mission critical applications
IT resources which are available
Business Continuity Plans (BCPs) 
Do you have any technology projects underway?
Current projects
Top 3 priorities
How are IT projects and/or computer requests tracked 
Desired/Future Projects
Issues/Concerns

The following process will be used to accomplish this:

A cover letter with a questionnaire explaining what we wish to accomplish and 
the process will be emailed to each of your direct reports
An interview will be set up with each direct report.  Each meeting will be 
scheduled for approximately 45 minutes.
Results of the questionnaire and interview will be used to create a draft 
report
The draft report will be distributed for comments
A final report with recommendations will be written and distributed.

I hope this process meets with your approval.  I can be reached at 58841.

Thank You!
