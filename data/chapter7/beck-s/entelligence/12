Hi Mary,

Here are the 2 posting forms with your name as dept. manager approver, 
Sally's name as VP approver and myself as requester to be forwarded to Linda 
Vargo for posting.  Linda suggested posting the positions internally for 5 
days and then posting them externally.  Although it would be great to get 
people on board from within the company, I think we should just get the 
postings out everywhere asap.

Also, Linda required the following questions to be answered:
Internal or external posting?  To be posted both internally and externally

Are these positions already budgeted? No, they will have to come from out of 
budget

Relocations costs to be provided? Relocation costs will be provided for 
Specialist and above positions but not for Clerk, Senior Clerk positions.  
The same also applies for agency fees, (yes to Specialist and above, and no 
to clerk/senior clerk).

Here are the postings to be approved by Sally.

Thanks,
Avril
