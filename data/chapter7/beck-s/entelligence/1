giving some additional 1-on-1's this week and next.

haven't been able to get a hold of her since.  Will call Ed McMichael in the 
group Wednesday when he gets back in town.

training.

completed.  We'll also have a prototype of Activity Details ready by then.	Nov
11. Training for Mexico	Left a message for Marc Sabine in the Mexico office	
12. Global Products	Left a message for Spenser Vosko	
13. Global Industrial Markets	Left a message for Andrew Conner	
14. eTV	We can run the eTV commercial again after Phase 2 is rolled out.

Any other suggestions?
