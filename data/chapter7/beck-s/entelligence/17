In response to some questions you had regarding cost to pursue the Global 
Intelligence project, the project team has put together a ball park costing.  
To let you know where we are and how things are proceeding, I have also put 
together a high level status summary.  Please review and let me know if you 
have any questions.  As mentioned in the document, we are proceeding with 
project development until directed otherwise.
