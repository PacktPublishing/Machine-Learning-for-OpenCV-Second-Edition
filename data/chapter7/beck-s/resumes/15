It appears that the implied vol on this one is quite high.  Perhaps we can=
=20
lower our VAR using historical vols.
I would be happy to interview him.  His resume does not appear to be=20
Research-worthy by any stretch so I guess RAC or OPs might be a fit
Should I forward his resume to Tony Vasut and bring him in to see a couple =
of=20
RACs and a couple of OPS as sort of a first exploratory interview??
Sally -pls advise your thoughts.
Vince - is this the price of being a Risk Management Rock Star?
