Jennifer was referred to me by my cousin.  I met her today and she seems like 
a very sharp person.  She is interested in EBS, but is open to other 
opportunities.  I told her about your group, and she was definitely 
interested.  I told her about Strategic Initiatives, but if you explained 
some of the other areas in your group, she might also be interested.

I will be sending her resume to several people, but I think you should talk 
to her based on the needs you continue to describe for your group.  Feel free 
to call her or EMail her at the addresses below.  Also, if there are any 
other people in North America I should send this to, please tell me.  With 
some experience, I  think she could do trading or origination, too.

Call me if you have any questions!

Dear Melissa,

I am a friend Mark and Lynn Richards through a family connection in the
Carolinas.  Mark suggested that I contact you.  Through my own research and
recommendations from peers, I am truly interested in exploring employment
opportunities at Enron.  I am scheduled to meet with David Chang this
Wednesday in order to discuss possibilities in the Broadband area.  If you
are available in the near-term, I would very much appreciate a few minutes
of your time in order to discuss other logical opportunities for someone
with my work experience and educational background.

I am attaching my resume; however, in summary, I am currently working in
Corporate Planning and Development at Reliant Energy.  My responsibilities
include the analysis of potential mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures.
In addition, I work with each business unit within Reliant Energy in order
to create a strategic, long-term forecast for the Company, incorporating
such uncertainties as deregulation in the Texas electricity markets.  Prior
to Reliant Energy, I worked as a Financial Analyst for Esso Caribbean and
Central America in Miami, Florida.  My direct responsibilities included
financial reporting and profitability analyses for Esso affiliates operating
in the Caribbean and Latin America.  I am also a 1997 graduate of
Thunderbird with a concentration in finance and a regional focus on Latin
America.

Please e-mail or call me at your convenience.  My numbers are 713-207-3609
(W) and 713-666-7287 (H).  Thank you very much and I look forward to hearing
from you.  Jennifer Bagwell
