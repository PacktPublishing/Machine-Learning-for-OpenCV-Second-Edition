Hello, 

Thank you in advance for taking the time to review Zach's resume for 
potential opportunities at Enron.? I appreciate your offer to identify if 
there are areas within Enron that could utilize his technical, business and 
project implementation skills.

Zach has worked the past 4 years as a technical consultant in our Customer 
Relationship Management practice of Deloitte Consulting.? His experience 
demonstrates a broad range of technical and business expertise working for 
clients such as the State of California, Puget Sound Energy and Kaiser 
Permanente.? Zach also played an integral role in the international 
e-commerce project based in Switzerland.

Zach is interested in finding a position which will enable him to leverage 
his technical skills in a business role for a company.? His contact 
information is listed on his resume if you feel as though his skills would 
meet the needs of a division within Enron.

Thank you again for your time, 

Andrea Crump
