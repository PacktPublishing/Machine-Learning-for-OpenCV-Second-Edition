Sally,

Per your request, here is a copy of my resume.  The information is updated 
through my role in investor relations which accounts for the review period.  
I also provided your assistant with a summarized list of my projects for the 
period and have attached that as well for you.  

Thanks and I look forward to visiting with you soon.

Regards,
Shelly
