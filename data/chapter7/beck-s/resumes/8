I really don't have a need for this guy.   I could send it over to Sally Beck 
to see if she has something on her plate that I don't know about.

Mr. Bland:

I just wanted to touch base with you again to see if any employment
opportunities with Enron have matched my background or experience. If there
is any other process that I need to complete, or another person I need to
contact please let me know. I have attached a copy of my cover letter and
resume.

I am very interested in employment with Enron, and would greatly like the
chance to interview.

Thank you,
