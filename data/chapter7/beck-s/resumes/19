Sally,

Thank you again for passing my resume to Ted Murphy. His recruiter is trying
to work the scheduling between myself and the six people that Ted wants me
to meet with. It is all very positive and I appreciate all your help.

I am also very interested in Enron Broadband Services on the commercial
side. With my options and structuring background, I believe that it would be
a great fit. What would be the best way to get my resume in front of Ken
Rice or the right person in his group? I am attaching an electronic copy for
easy forwarding.

Thank you

Rob
