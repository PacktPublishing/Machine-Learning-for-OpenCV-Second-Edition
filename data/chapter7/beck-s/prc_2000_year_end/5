Sally,

Attached is the final results from the meeting today.  These results DO NOT 
include the Analyst and Associates.  The spreadsheet contains an overall 
picture of the meeting today and a breakdown by organization (EOPS, EGM, 
EIM).  There are also four charts which display the overall meeting and the 
breakdowns as well.  I have sent a copy to Bob Hall which DOES NOT include 
the VP rankings.  Please let me know if you need any other data.  Great 
meeting today!  Have a wonderful weekend.

Anne Marie
