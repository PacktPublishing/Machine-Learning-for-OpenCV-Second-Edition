Sally,

I hope that things went well in Calgary.  I am rapping things up here and I 
cannot wait to return home.  

My tentative meeting with Joe Gold for this afternoon has been rescheduled 
for 9:00 this morning.  Attached is my assessment of the Continental Power 
operations which I intend to discuss with him.  The first page is for Joe in 
case he would like to keep notes from our discussion and the second page is 
more detailed for myself.  Joe asked that he and I meet privately to discuss 
the operations.  I've tried to be candid, but yet politically correct.

Today I am having lunch with Fernly and meeting with the Weather Commercial 
team at 4:00.

I'll phone to give you an update,
Todd
