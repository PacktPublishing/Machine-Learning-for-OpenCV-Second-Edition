If Todd was unaccompanied, we would have paid o2167 p/m.  The flat he is 
occupying is o2817 p/m, difference of o650 p/m. Not sure if this is going to 
be relevant enough to the RC. We definitely could have rented the place so it 
would not have been left empty.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Before I speak with Sally, exactly what piece of the housing are we charging 
to her RC since he took existing housing?

Sally would like to speak to you regarding the differential.  She knows that 
Todd had taken residence in accommodations left vacant by Beth Perlman.  She 
want ed more clarification on how that would be managed since it was 
utilizing an existing space. The RC she provided was Todd Hall's RC#2182. 
Please call me at your earliest convenience as I will explain the remaining 
details.

Matt

Please can you arrange for Todd Hall, who is coming from Houston to work for 
Barry Pearce, to stay at Dolphin Square apartments? Please liaise with him 
directly on this.

We have a bit of a complicated costing situation. Barry Pearce will be taking 
the cost of the normal one bedrooms at Dolphin Square and Sally is taking the 
rest of the cost.

Jane - please provide the costs for Sally's RC.

Thanks
Tara
