Sally,

I wanted you to know that I responded to this e-mail and I will also talk 
with Jeff Sorenson today.  While I am here, I will meet the Weather team and 
introduce myself.

Today and tomorrow are critical days as far as the Book-Split Project is 
concerned.  I will give you an update this afternoon or when you arrive on 
Thursday.  There is quite a lot of discussion surrounding the MTM of 
Transmission.  We have now agreed that we should MTM all of Transmission and 
not "cherry pick," and now it's how to handle the mechanics.

Talk with you soon,
Todd

I did speak with Mark and had Tim meet with him also.  Tim and Michael sat 
together and further discussed the P&L and associated processes.  On Monday, 
Tim accepted the position and I informed Sally, but obviously did not give 
you the update.

When I return, tentatively May 15, I would like to get a copy of the resumes 
which you have and will post the position again.  Thank you for holding 
things together and after Tim has 2-3 weeks with Michael, he should be able 
to move to Structuring.

Pencil in lunch for that Tuesday or Wednesday that I return,
Todd

I haven't heard from you lately.  Understand you spoke directly to Mark 
Tawney.  I assume Tim Norton is a go for replacing Michael Nguyen as Risk 
Book administrator for Weather on a full time basis.  I plan to withdraw the 
job posting from the board.
