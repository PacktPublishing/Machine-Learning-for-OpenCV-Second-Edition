Dear Sally, 
Thank you very much for making the trip up to Austin and taking the time to listen to my "stories".  I enjoyed the interview, and I hope you had some fun, too.  I appreciate you sharing one of your "examples", and I especially appreciate your interest in my teaching experiences.
I you ever want to swap parenting stories (or - better yet - send advice to a new parent entering the business world), I'm all ears.  Thank you again.
Sincerely, 
David Silldorff
