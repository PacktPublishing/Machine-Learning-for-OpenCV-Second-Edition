I agree.  I will coordinate with Kristin (for the Associates) and make it h=
appen.
Once I have a date in mind I will let you know.  The latest start date for =
interns is June 4, so I will try to schedule it for the last week in June o=
r very early in July.

Thank you!

Last summer we hosted a lunch for summer interns right at the end of their =
assignments with us.  We had other UT alums attend the lunch.  Feedback fro=
m the summer interns was favorable.  Their key comment, though, was that it=
 would have been great to have had that get together earlier in the summer =
so that the interns could have networked with other Enron UT alums througho=
ut the summer.  Can we plan something for the UT interns earlier this summe=
r?  It would probably work well to include the summer associates as well.  =
I will be glad to help in any way.  Just let me know.=20
