George, Sally and Shelly,

The attachment is a list of the students who will be coming to Houston and
be going to both dinner and lunch.

We are looking forward to both dinner and our lunch/office tour of Enron.
Again, thank you for the effort and support Enron puts forth for our
program.

George, unless I hear otherwise, we will plan on meeting you and Shelly
tomorrow night at 8:00 at The Sierra Grill on Montrose. If we are running a
little late, we will be there shortly.
