Thank you for forwarding this information to me.  I instructed the candidates 
on campus that we would be in touch with them within 2 weeks.  Actually, for 
OU students, I will be calling them personally tomorrow to let them know 
their status.  Their invitation letters will be sent shortly thereafter.

Thanks!

As of Friday, October 13, it seems that this student had not heard back from 
Enron.  What is the timeline for getting back to students regarding Super 
Saturday?

Dear Ms. Beck,

I want to thank you for interviewing me for the analyst position last week.  
I enjoyed meeting you and learning about your work.  My enthusiasm for the 
position and my interest in working for Enron were strengthened as a result 
of the interview.

I believe that my background and experience fit nicely with the job 
requirements, and I am sure that I could make a significant contribution to 
the firm.  I have not heard back yet and would appreciate any information you 
can give.

Thank You,

Irfan Iqbal
