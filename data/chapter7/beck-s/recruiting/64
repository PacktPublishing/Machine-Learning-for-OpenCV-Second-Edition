Dear Ms. Beck:

I am writing to thank you for taking your time to talk with me on the
phone this morning. I am very excited about this opprtunity to speak with
you again.

I understand that you must very busy now and I attach my resume to gain
more time to discuss how my background fits Enron's requirements and
business objectives.

I will call you at 4.30 pm today.

Thank you,


Sona
