I told the scholarship winners that within the next few weeks, we would like to meet with them for lunch or dinner  before the semester is over.  So since we are on the subject, do you have plans to be in Austin any time soon?  I will coordinate the students around your schedule.  Also, if you think there are others that should join the smaller luncheon/dinner, let me know.  I thought about asking Traci Warner and Billy Lemmons since they are new to the AA program.

Are we going to do anything for the students before fall semester?  The dinner with Dean May and others from the University is great in the fall.  But last year, we had thought about just a small lunch with the students and a few from Enron.  This can be simple and we don't have to coordinate around the schedule of any UT faculty or staff.  But it does allow Enron to have a more immediate follow up with the scholarship recepients to celebrate their being chosen.  --Sally
