Sally,

Thanks for the e-mail regarding summer interns.  I apologize that Lexi and=
=20
Shelly were unable to provide you with the answers you were seeking.  I wis=
h=20
that you had contacted either Celeste or me to indicate that you were havin=
g=20
difficulty.  I have personally assured you on several occasions that I was=
=20
available to either speak with you or meet with you if for some reason any=
=20
member of my staff was not responsive.  That being said please allow me to=
=20
explain the recruiting strategy since I was instrumental in helping to set =
it.

You are absolutely correct.  It is great to do market research if time=20
permits or it is regarding an issue of which we have little knowledge.  As=
=20
you are aware, over the past year we have engaged a professional recruiting=
=20
firm (Brecker & Merryman) who has assisted us in a number of different mark=
et=20
research projects.  However, in my opinion, this issue is not one that=20
required much research.  I have been involved in recruiting in some way,=20
shape or form at both the graduate and undergraduate level for the past 10=
=20
years.  Most major organizations, with the exception of the Accounting firm=
s,=20
begin the summer intern recruiting process in early spring.  There are=20
actually some universities that do not allow recruitment of summer interns=
=20
until after a certain date, particularly in the MBA programs.  For example,=
=20
Harvard does not allow an organization to come on campus and speak to first=
=20
year students until January.  As indicated, the firms that generally recrui=
t=20
in the fall are the Accounting firms and they are primarily recruiting for=
=20
"spring" internships.

The recruiting strategy at Enron is no different this year than it was last=
=20
year with respect to summer interns.   Presentations were made in January &=
=20
February and offers were made in February and March.  The only school that=
=20
did not follow the normal process was OU under the direction of George Hope=
. =20
We did, of course, recruit summer interns in the fall for the tax group=20
because they are competing directly with the Accounting Firms.

Utilizing this strategy did not impair Enron=01,s ability to hire quality s=
ummer=20
interns.  This past summer Enron had 76 summer Analysts (undergraduate) and=
=20
40 summer Associates (graduate).  We intentionally limited the number of=20
summer hires to ensure that the individuals hired received meaningful=20
assignments.  Approximately 85% of these individuals received permanent=20
offers to join Enron.  =20

The reason Enron has not had a problem recruiting quality undergraduate=20
summer interns is primarily because many organizations do not hire=20
undergraduates for summer positions.  They generally focus on MBAs,=20
particularly the investment banks and consulting firms which are the firms=
=20
that Jeff Skilling identifies as Enron's competitors.  Because the=20
undergraduates are not actively recruited by our competition we have=20
continued to have a special focus on these individuals (i.e. the reason the=
re=20
were 76 undergraduates and only 40 MBAs).

With respect to OU and UT specifically since those were the schools about=
=20
which you raised a concern, let me address your concerns.  In your e-mail y=
ou=20
indicated that you had research conducted at UT and OU.  You did not howeve=
r,=20
provide the results of the research or the person to whom they had spoken=
=20
therefore I had Lexi Elliott contact both UT and OU.

While OU has not gotten back to her, following is the information obtained=
=20
from UT.

o The contact at UT Career Services is Cindy Henson. =20
o According to Cindy, approximately 5% of companies actively recruiting on=
=20
campus conduct interviews in the fall for "summer" internships.  Cindy=20
attributes  this to the fact that these companies cannot come in the spring=
,=20
or, in the case of Andersen Consulting, have a tremendous need and conduct=
=20
all interviews  at one time. =20
o In conclusion, Cindy estimated that 95% of companies actively recruiting =
on=20
campus recruit in the spring for summer internships.

We have not received information from OU therefore I am unable to provide t=
he=20
statistics at this time.  I will provide as soon as I am in receipt of such=
=20
information. =20

It appears that the information your source obtained is considerably=20
different than what we were told.  If you would provide the name of the=20
individual to whom they spoke I will follow up to determine the reason for=
=20
the discrepancies.

While I understand your concern with respect to OU, they appear to be=20
different than most of the other schools at which we recruit.  If you belie=
ve=20
that it is critical to recruit summer interns at OU in the fall we are=20
supportive; however, because Lexi has other school interviews that are=20
already scheduled she will not be in a position to facilitate the interview=
=20
process during the trip you have scheduled currently.  As you are aware, in=
=20
most instances, the dates for presentations and interviews are dictated by=
=20
the respective universities and were secured in early August. If you would=
=20
like for her to try and secure an interview schedule for a later date this=
=20
fall she can certainly work with your schedule and her current schedule to=
=20
support your efforts.

I hope this has been helpful.  I can understand and appreciate your=20
frustration if you are not getting answers from the recruiter or her=20
manager.  Again, I offer that I am available and willing to work with you i=
f=20
you are having difficulty with members of the Program staff. =20

Please let me know what you decide about recruiting this fall for summer=20
interns and whether I can be of any additional assistance.

Charlene
