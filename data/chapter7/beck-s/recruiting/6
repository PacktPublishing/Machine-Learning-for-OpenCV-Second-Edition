I thought this was a nice thank you from David.  Even though he did not win the scholarship, he enjoyed the experience and he is offering to help us in the future!

Dear Karen, 

Thank you again for including me in your group of finalists for the Enron Scholarship.  Enron's commitment to community service and education is most admirable, I and felt honored to be selected (particularly considering the other people chosen).  I even enjoyed the interview experience, mostly because of the neat interviewers.

I also appreciate the prompt replies to all correspondence, as well as the follow-up call this evening (even if the news was not quite what I wanted to hear).  It's great to see people "doing it right".  If you need any assistance with future events at UT, please don't hesitate to call.

Sincerely, 

David Silldorff
