Sally - A new idea popped into my head - I don't know if it makes things
easier - or if everyone would like the idea, but here goes:

What if we gathered, as a whole family, for a couple of days, somewhere easy
- in Texas - like the Hill Country Hyatt, or somehwere in Galveston, or the
YO Ranch or somewhere.   We might spend one night or two - plan something
fun for the kids, get a big suite where the adults could toast mom and dad
with champagne and appetizers - spend time playing games, whatever - just go
somewhere easy - and just spend a day or two.

Then, at that event, we could give Mom and Dad a gift certificate for a more
special (and far-away) trip for them - like a four-day weekend in San
Francisco - or somewhere they'd really like to go.

This would eliminate travel hassles for all of the families involved - but
provide us all an opporunity (albeit condensed) to get together - and Mom
and Dad would still get to go someplace fun.    Maybe we could "chip in"
varying amounts to Mom and Dad's trip so that cindy and richard could afford
it.

Thoughts?   -Cara
