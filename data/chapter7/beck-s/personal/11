Hi, sistas-

Here's the scoop on the Josephine House:

We can reserve with just a credit card; no deposit required.

Parties under 20:  $200 room fee.  $50 valet parking fee.

I confirmed "17" with mom.

Heidi sent some sample menus.   A 3-course menu (appetizer or salad, entree,
dessert) is $45.
A 4-course (same as 3-course plus hors d'oeuvres) sample menu is $52.
Each menu could include a choice of three or four options per course.  The
food sounds really good.

So, here's a guess at cost:
17 people at $45 =  $765
Beverages =        $200
Gratuity =   $193
Valet =    $  50
Room rental =   $200
TOTAL   $1408, or $469 per family if we divide it into
thirds

What do you guys think?   Should we explore other options - or just go with
this?   I think Chris and I would be fine with this sort of cost - but
probably couldn't go crazy with gift and decorations too.  So, if we really
want to do the photo(s) - do we have a cost for these yet?, we may want to
consider other options.    Thoughts?   -cara
