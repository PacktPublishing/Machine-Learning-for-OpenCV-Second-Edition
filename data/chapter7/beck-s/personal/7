Hi, Sal.   Just talked with Cindy and she said you're still trying to work
out weekend plans.   I want to reiterate that, although it would be great to
have you here, please don't make it too hard on yourself.  Don't pressure
yourself to come; I will totally understand if you do not.   If you don't
come this weekend, I bet you will be here soon anyway - because this tummy
is sure to erupt in the near future!    Either way is great.

Just had to go get some more clothes (at Motherhood)  . . . since I am
carrying all of my weight in my belly, it has expanded to epic proportions
and I cannot fit into my pants!

Set up the baby bedding this weekend - it looks really cute!    But I
couldn't figure out what do with the mattress pads (what do the cords fit
around?)   Instead I put that cottony thing with the netting on as a
mattress pad.   Is that what it is for?    I know you explained all of this
to us in December, but we could not take it all in at that time!    love, c.
