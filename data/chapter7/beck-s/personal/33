This is Cara's assistant, Cara White.   Cara asked me to send you her
itinerary:

Cara will be in New York for a week.

Thursday through Saturday, she will stay at the Edison Hotel (212) 840-5000

Sunday through Wednesday, she will stay at the Grand Hyatt (she doesn't know
the telephone no. - and I am such a busy personal assistant, I don't have
time to look it up.)

Also, until Sunday, you may try her husband's cell phone (512) 657-1555

You can always try Cara's cell phone (512) 970-0608 - but she hasn't really
figured out how to retrieve messages yet - so you'll probably have better
luck leaving a message at the hotel.

Cara will return on Thursday evening on American Flight #1669, arriving at
4:25 P.M.
