Dear Sally and Cindy,

Just received an invitation to Dot's birthday party which the Baptist Church
in Hallettsville is giving for her.  The party will be on September 9th at
10:30 AM at church, and Dot's children are inviting us to the house
afterwards.  I will forward a copy of the invitation to  you.  Just wanted to
get the date to you now.

Mom
