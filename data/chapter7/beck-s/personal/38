Sally, 
I'm sorry I left you off my original note but I wanted you to know......

...the third time is a charm.  After 2 failed adoptions, God has blessed me 
with a beautiful daughter!  Emily Lyn was born on Saturday, July 8 at 11:18 
am in San Antonio.  She weighed 7 lbs. and measured 19 inches.  She is so 
tiny and has a head full of dark hair!  I brought her home last night at 8:30 
pm.  Our first 
night went well even if I didn't get any sleep.  It's going to take some time 
for me to get used to the noises she makes.  I must admit, there were
days when I never thought this would happen.  I appreciate all the kind words 
of encouragement many of you have shared over the last few years
as I have gone through this process, especially during the really low 
points.  I am truly blessed.
I will be out of the office for a while but feel free to stay in touch as I'm 
sure I'll be logging in often.  Also, if I left someone off the list here, 
please have them forgive me.  Remember, I'm working on 0 sleep.  Please feel 
free to pass this along to anyone I may have fogotten.  Thanks.
Dianne
