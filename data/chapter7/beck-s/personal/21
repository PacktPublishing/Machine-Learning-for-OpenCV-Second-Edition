Sally,

Thought this was good....

Hey, here is another wonderful group of facts about women.  I don't
normally like to pass these on but it has too much importance.  Even if
your a skeptic read to the bottom.



Did you know that it's Beautiful Women Month? Well, it is and that means
you.


There are 3 billion women who don't look like supermodels . . .and only
eight who do. Marilyn Monroe wore a size 14. If Barbie was a real woman,
she'd have to walk on all fours due to her proportions. The average woman
weighs 144 lbs and wears between a 9-14. One out of every four college aged
women has an eating disorder. The models in the magazines are airbrushed --
not perfect!

A psychological study in 1995 found that three minutes spent looking at a
fashion magazine caused 70% of women to feel depressed, guilty, and
shameful.  Models twenty years ago weighed 8% less than the average woman.
Today they  weigh 23% less.

Beauty of a Woman -

The beauty of a woman
Is not in the clothes she wears,
The figure she carries
Or the way she combs her hair.

The beauty of a woman
Must be seen from her eyes,
Because that is the doorway to her heart,
The place where love resides.

The beauty of a woman
Is not in a facial mole,
But true beauty in a woman
Is reflected in her soul.

It is the caring that she lovingly gives
The passion that she shows,
The beauty of a woman
With passing years - only grows.

An English professor wrote the words, "Woman without her man is nothing," on
the blackboard and directed the students to punctuate it correctly.  The men
wrote: "Woman, without her man, is nothing."   The women wrote: "Woman!
Without her, man is nothing."

The Images of Mother -
4 YEARS OF AGE  ~ My Mommy can do anything!
8 YEARS OF AGE  ~ My Mom knows a lot!  A whole lot!
12 YEARS OF AGE  ~ My Mother doesn't really know quite everything.
14 YEARS OF AGE  ~ Naturally, Mother doesn't know that, either.
16 YEARS OF AGE  ~ Mother? She's hopelessly old-fashioned.
18 YEARS OF AGE  ~ That old woman? She's way out of date!
25 YEARS OF AGE  ~ Well, she might know a little bit about it.
35 YEARS OF AGE  ~ Before we decide, let's get Mom's opinion.
45 YEARS OF AGE  ~ Wonder what Mom would have thought about it?
65 YEARS OF AGE  ~ Wish I could talk it over with Mom.

Please send this to five phenomenal women today in celebration of Women's
