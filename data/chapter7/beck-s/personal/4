A TOAST TO TEXAS!
As early as 1900, March 2 became a day for Texas Exes to observe as a 
holiday. A
great deal of tradition and sentiment surrounds the celebration
on the local level. In that year, The Ex-Students' Association adopted a 
resolution that:
"Whenever two Texas Exes shall meet on March 2, they shall sit and break 
bread and
pay tribute to the institution that made their education possible." UT alumni 
all over the
world have followed this tradition. Wherever you are on March 2, 2001, we 
hope you'll
join us in a Texas "toast":  To our State, whose founders made our education 
possible;
To Texas Exes who have provided generations of leadership; And to the proud 
tradition
of continued excellence of The University of Texas.Hook'em Horns! For more
