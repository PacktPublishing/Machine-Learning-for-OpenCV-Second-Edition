I've just looked at some beautiful photos--hand colored done by our project
manager's wife--she is a professional photographer.  How would you all feel
about having a really good, artistic picture done of the three of us for a
gift to Mom and Dad?  Let me know--we could do it while Sally is here for
the shower....
