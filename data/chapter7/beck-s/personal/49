Hi Sally,

I need to be working on my newest project, for which we went to Hallettsville
this week, and tomorrow is Garden club, and I am almost through as president.
 I will not preside in April, as I have a conflict-new secretary in Colonial
Dames and then all we have left in Garden Club will be our May luncheon.
Being presdent has not been too bad, as all of the ladies are very helpful.
My project is the completion of our papers for the recognition of our
cemetery by the State Historic Commissson .    That is why we were in
Hallettville.  Hope to get that done by Tuesday-there are many attachments
necessary.  We stayed in a Bed and Breakfast, which was fair but not
oustanding breakfast. I ran by to see Dot for a few minutes before we headed
home.  Mary had spent Sunday night with us to go with us and we met our
cousin from Missouri City also.

Enough of that, this will be a great quick way to communicate.  I am glad
Cindy gave me your address.  Hope you have had a great week-end.  I will
write more another time.

Love,

Mom (almost signed it Sue)
