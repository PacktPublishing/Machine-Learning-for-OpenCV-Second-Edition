Sally,
Hope all is well with you guys.   I am excited about our father-daughter
outing to ENRON FIELD later this month.  I understand that there is a person
at Enron who coordinates these events for us.  If you would not mind, would
you give me the person's name.
Eric is in the Boy Scouts and this sounds like an outing that would be
interesting for them also.
Thanks,
Andy
