> >>      For my fiftieth birthday this year, my husband (the dear)

> Although I

> >> I'll call Bruce, who identified himself as a 26-year-old aerobics
> >> instructor and model for clothing and swimwear.   My husband seemed
> >> pleased
> >> with my enthusiasm to get started.  The club encouraged me to keep a

> >> to chart my progress.
> >>       Monday:
> >>    Started my day at 6:00am. Tough to get out of bed, but found it
> was
> >> well
> >> worth it when I arrived at the health club to find Bruce waiting for
> me.
> >> He is something of a Greek God - with blond hair, dancing eyes and a
> >> dazzling white smile.  Woo Hoo!
> >>      Bruce gave me a tour and showed me the machines.  He took my

> >> after five minutes on the treadmill.  He was alarmed that my pulse

> >>        I enjoyed watching the skillful way in which he conducted his

> >> holding it in the whole time he was around.
> >>      This is going to be a FANTASTIC week!!
> >>
> >>    Tuesday:
> >>    I drank a whole pot of coffee, but I finally made it out the

> >> Bruce
> >> made me lie on my back and push a heavy iron bar into the air - then

> >> put

> >>    Wednesday:

> >> a

> >>      Driving was okay as long as I didn't' try to steer or stop.  I
> parked
> >> on top of a GEO in the club parking lot.  Bruce was impatient with

> >> insisting that my screams bothered other club members.   His voice

> >> nasally whine that is VERY annoying.  My chest hurt when I got on

> >> rendered obsolete by elevators?  Bruce told me it would help me get
