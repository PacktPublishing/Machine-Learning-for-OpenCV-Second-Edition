NIGHTTIME CAMPUS TOUR: THE MOONLIGHT PROWL:
http://www.utexas.edu/tours/prowl
The Moonlight Prowl is a nighttime tour of the campus filled with
anecdotes of student life, University history, and all sorts of "UT lore."
Stories have been collected from professors' memoirs, old newspaper
accounts, and from the countless boxes in the UT archives. The Prowl is
intended to help "personalize" the University, explore a little of its 
history,
and have some fun.
The tour is free! For a schedule, some Prowl Stories, and even a UT
Trivia Quiz, check out the Moonlight Prowl web site.

INTRODUCING THE UT MEMORY BANK:
http://www.utexas.edu/tours/prowl
YOUR COLLEGE MEMORIES ARE PRICELESS! SAVE THEM IN THE
UT MEMORY BANK!
Here's your chance to make history! The UT Memory Bank is a serious
effort to collect the personal anecdotes, recollections and other memories
of students, ex-students, faculty and staff, and others associated with the
University. Over time, contributions to the Bank will form a "collective
memory" of the University's history.
All submissions will be printed and donated to a special collection in the
University Archives for posterity, and will also be posted on the Moonlight
Prowl web site for others to enjoy, sorted by decade. See for yourself, and
contribute to the collection!
