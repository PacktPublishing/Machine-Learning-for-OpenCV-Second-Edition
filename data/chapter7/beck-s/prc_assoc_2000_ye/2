Sally--

I'm pretty sure that I saw your name on my calendar sometime this week to 
talk about Glenn Surowiec, but then it disappeared.  I would be happy to let 
you know how he's done (he was pre-ranked in Superior at EBS, so I imagine 
you're going to need some ammunition.)  Since I will be in the meeting as 
well, I can speak up when details need to get hashed out.  If I mistakenly 
missed our appointment, I apologize.  Let me know if I can help.

See you Wednesday...
Brad Richter
