This is the preliminary results of "round 2" of testing the management 
report.  I will give you the highlights tomorrow in our meeting.  (Stephen's 
comments pretty much cover it).

Louise,

I have attached a draft of the newly revised report on our test results of 
the EOL Management Report for your review.  Please keep in mind this is a 
tentative draft.  Mark and Andrew still want to perform some QA on the 
results and Torrey is still looking into some of the observations.  

To summarize, we observed a significant improvement from the last test we 
performed a few months ago.  The systemic problems that created a large 
volume of the discrepancies in our previous testing have been greatly 
reduced.  The majority of the discrepancies identified in the most recent 
testing are primarily a result of random data entry errors and some deal 
booking changes made in the back office without the Product Control Group's 
knowledge.  Torrey has already corrected the most significant discrepancies 
and is continuing to investigate the smaller items.  

Andrew and I will both be on vacation for the week of August 28.  When we 
return, we will set up a meeting with you and Dave to discuss the final 
results once Torrey has had time to conclude his research.



Steve
