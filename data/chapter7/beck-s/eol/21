I have not received a call back from Jeff Bartlett, but based on the brochure 
I received from Louise, here is what I understand:

DealBench is a way to streamline processes to efficiently execute 
transactions and distribute deal-related information.  There are 5 platform 
tools - document sharing, multi-media, auctioning, secure communication, and 
deal management.   There are five primary products offered which utilize the 
tools provided...  Bank Products, Structured Products, Commercial Paper, 
Procurement, and Legal Space. 

1) Bank Products - deal management for issuance of debt offerings (credit 
revolvers/secured term-notes) 
2) Structured Products - deal management for initial issuance or re-sale of 
bonds, leveraged leases and other financial transactions
3)  Commercial Paper - deal mgmt for issuance of CP
4)  Procurement - management of wholesale purchasing and selling of various 
products
5)  Legal Space - designed to meet the needs of attorneys at law firms (doc 
sharing, aggregation and organization in a secure environment)

I have a lot of questions for Jeff, so I will send you a quick note when I 
speak to him.
