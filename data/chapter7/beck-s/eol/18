1. Introduction

We are planning to launch version 2.0 of EnronOnline to customers within th=
e=20
next few days.  In preparation for this launch, the new web site will be=20
released to internal users in North America on Wednesday, September 13th. =
=20
European internal users will be launched shortly after North America. =20
External customers will follow a few days later.=20

One of the purposes of the internal launch is to simulate the system load=
=20
which will be caused by the full customer launch.  Accordingly, we apprecia=
te=20
your cooperation in helping us to simulate this load by logging into=20
http://prod.enrononline.com (no www.)  This is a live web site and all trad=
es=20
are real.

New features (as per recent presentations and training sessions) include:

? Price limit orders
? Enhanced customization
? Floating windows
? Market news and quotes
? Weather maps and tables
? Industry-specific publications
? Market-specific homepages

2. Version 2.0 Launch Date
EnronOnline Version 2.0 will be launched to the public a few days after our=
=20
internal launch. We  will be using the new version internally from Wednesda=
y,=20
Sept. 13. This will provide an opportunity for you to become familiar with=
=20
using the new application in the production environment before our customer=
s=20
start to use it.

3. New Website Feature Details

Price limit orders: Customers have the ability to set up orders that=20
automatically execute as soon as the price and volume requested become=20
available. The limit orders remain open in the system until they are=20
executed, cancelled by the user, or when they expire. All pending orders wi=
ll=20
expire no later than 12 hours after being placed.

Pending Price Limit Orders will appear in a new window below the Quotes=20
screen in the website.

Product tabs: EnronOnline users can use enhanced filtering capabilities to=
=20
create separate page tabs for the products that interest them.  Users can=
=20
instantly access each page tab with a click of their mouse. Sort Ordering c=
an=20
be changed by clicking on a column heading, with multiple sorts possible by=
=20
holding down the shift key while clicking.

Floating windows: Users have the ability to create multiple windows with=20
different products by right-clicking on the products in the main quotes=20
screen.

Market news: Website users can now access the latest headlines, sports and=
=20
industry news from Reuters. Furthermore, the information categories can be=
=20
customized according to personal interests. To customize a particular=20
category, users need to click the Edit button in the category heading.

All information categories can be collapsed to save space. To expand or=20
collapse a category, users need to click the arrow to the left of the=20
category heading.

Stock quotes: EnronOnline now offers stock quotes (20 min. delay) from majo=
r=20
exchanges around the world.

Weather insights: Customers can now access weather maps and temperature dat=
a=20
for specific cities and regions.  Weather forecasts, up to six days ahead,=
=20
and temperature differentials from periodic averages are now available.

Industry publications: Website users can read a wide range of=20
industry-specific publications including Argus European Natural Gas, Argus=
=20
European Electricity, the news from NGI=01,s Daily Gas Price Index, Bandwid=
th=20
Desk, Coal Daily and more.

4. New Stack Manager Features

The Stack Manager has been updated to facilitate Price Limit Orders. You wi=
ll=20
notice that there is a new button at the top of the Stack Manager, which wi=
ll=20
open a window showing a summary of the best Price Limit Order bids and offe=
rs=20
against your managed products. You can click the "+" sign to the left of a=
=20
summary to show a list of all the Price Limit Orders which have been placed=
=20
against that product.

Under normal circumstances, the price shown on the website will be the same=
=20
as the price on your Stack Manager. However, the system will not allow you =
to=20
show a price which is better than an existing Price Limit Order. Instead, t=
he=20
system will show a price on the website equivalent to the prevailing Price=
=20
Limit Order while it is being filled. Once the appropriate Price Limit Orde=
rs=20
are filled, then the website will again show your Stack Manager prices.

It is important that you complete the =01&Maximum Volume=018 field in the P=
roduct=20
Properties window and that you select "Allow Price Limit Orders". Also, mak=
e=20
sure that the price tick window in the Stack Manager=01,s =01&Product Prope=
rties=018=20
field is appropriate for the product. If you do not do this, your customers=
=20
will not be able to use Price Limit Orders for your products.


5. Your Participation
Please log in to http://prod.enrononline.com (no www.) on Wednesday. To=20
ensure EnronOnline Version 2.0 is a success, it is important that you have =
a=20
full understanding of the new features and help promote the system to your=
=20
customers.
