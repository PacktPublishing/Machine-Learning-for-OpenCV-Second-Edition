This is probably way more information than you want, but just in case you 
want to see where we are on the audit comments, attached is a worksheet I am 
updating every few weeks to ensure we address all their issues asap.  They 
will (at the request of Louise) be conducting a follow up audit in October, 
and "re-audit" the management report in mid-July.
