Please contact me to determine the salary adjustment that you want to give to 
your newly promoted employee.    If the employee has been promoted out of 
your department but is still within ENA please pass this e-mail to their 
current department head. 
I am still missing salary adjustments for 9 employees and I am not able to 
present the aggregate amounts to the Head of the Business Unit for final 
review.
You can reach me at ext. 36703 at your convenience. 
Thanks for your help in this matter, hgm
