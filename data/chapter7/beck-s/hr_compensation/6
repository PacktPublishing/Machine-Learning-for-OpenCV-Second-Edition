There are a few key people which I believe are essential to achieve our goals 
in gas risk management.  They are :

Will Kelly
Kam Keiser
David Baumbach
Darron Giron
Kyle Etter

Also,  Darron Giron will be taking over my role as West controller.  I am 
still considering who should take over my role over the Benchmark and Natural 
Gas P&L.

Lastly,  I am scheduled to take a vacation Thursday and Friday.  I have made 
sure that everyone of the controllers will be here,  and I can be reached by 
pager and phone.  I can cancel this trip if need be.

Thanks,

JG
