The below email is in regards to the cost charts Sheri asked that I provide to Greg Piper.  The comment, "The goal for us is to put the information into a form that I can share with potential external counterparties on Tuesday" is why I am forwarding the email to you.  I will dig deeper to understand the purpose.  Also, Sally the gas chart is for both Financial and Physical and the increase in cost for February is due to social security and unemployment taxes.  These cost were incorrectly recorded to our cost centers and will be reversed during March.

Hi Sheri --

I hope your Mom's surgery went fine.

Thanks for pulling the info together.  I have meetings on Monday until 3pm, but I believe that David can get together with you on Monday morning.  Perhaps David can pull in someone else from our team also.  The goal for us is to put the information into a form that I can share with potential external counterparties on Tuesday.  Thanks again for your help.

-- Rex

Dave/Rex - we have put together some information for you all.  Unfortunately, I need to leave for the day (my mom is in surgery this afternoon).  Can we get together first thing Monday?  Please leave me a voice mail as I will be checking in today and will have my assistant set something up.

Thanks
Sheri
