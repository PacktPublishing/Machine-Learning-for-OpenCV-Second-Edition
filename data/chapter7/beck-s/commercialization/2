Sally,

This includes most of the suggestions Andy made (all the word/format related ones, at least).  The only one I have not made relates to our discussion about adding a slide that outlines the history behind the Operations Pricing Desk and the various factors considered in building it.  Please let me know if you're busy and want me to glean the information from the slides you have archived.

Lets talk about it in more detail tomorrow.  If you need me at anytime, please feel free to contact me on my cell phone at 281.704.1060

Regards,
Rahil
