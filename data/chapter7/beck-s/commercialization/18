Jafry,

Here is the actual presentation requirements as per the RFP.  We can deviate
from the form, but must address their stated requirements.  I think we
should structure the Enron portion as follows:

I.    ENW Overview
II.   Products and Services
III.  Engagement Approach

Let me know what you think.  We need to pull this together today.

I've also attached the material Steve sent me previously.

Thanks,

Greg
