Gentleman,

I've attached a copy of the RFP response for CMS.  It has been delivered via
email and a hardcopy will be delivered tomorrow.

Please review the proposal and let's determine if there are any channels
Enron can work to ensure we make the short list.  Also, in anticipation of
making the list I would like to discuss our presentation strategy.  Are you
available Wednesday to meet.  I'm not available mid-afternoon.

Please advise.

Thanks,

Greg
