I just want to summarize/clarify our discussions so far on the Commercial=
=20
Support model for Enron Japan.=20

My background:
In Europe the Commercial Support function was divided into a Middle Office=
=20
(MO) and a Back Office (BO) part, with a European controller (Fearnley Dyso=
n)=20
responsible for both functions. For Scandinavia, the only trading office in=
=20
Europe outside of London, I was responsible for both functions, as Local=20
Office controller, reporting into Barry Pearce, who reported to Fearnley. I=
n=20
Japan I also have this Local Office Controller function, as being responsib=
le=20
for MO/BO activities in this region. The MO would consist of the trading=20
related functions: Documentation (Capture & Confirmation), Risk Management,=
=20
Settlement and Trade Accounting. The BO would consist of G&A's, Salaries &=
=20
Wages, Tax, Management reporting, Statutory reporting and VAT.=20

Back Office:
I report directly to Cassandra Scultz (VP & CAO of Enron APACHI). As much a=
s=20
possible are to be outsourced to our Sydney office (Heidi Mason, who also=
=20
reports to Cassandra), but some work has to be done in Tokyo. The reasons f=
or=20
this outsourcing decision is enclosed in the Power Point presentation=20
enclosed below. For payments we use Houston Treasury, as they are the only=
=20
ones that can exercise a payment in the banking systems.



Middle Office:

Mandate
What I have in writing is a section from Joe Hirl's Memo (Request for Japan=
=20
Power Trading Positions (DRAFT)) to Rick Buy and Greg Whalley dated April 1=
9=20
this year (please find enclosed)

Back Office Operations:  Jan Erland Bekeng in cooperation with Sally Beck=
=20
will look to establish the local risk books in Tokyo and define any=20
system     modifications necessary given the characteristics of the Japanes=
e=20
electricity market.  Enron Japan will handle trade capture      and risk=20
management while confirmations and settlements will occur in Houston under=
=20
Sally Beck=01,s supervision.  IT support and     system modification will b=
e=20
overseen by Anthony Dayao and performed in Houston.



Discussion -  Current & Future Situation
I see more commodities than Power. Metals will arrive September 25, Weather=
=20
is on the way from Sydney, and Garry Hickerson will from September 1 have a=
=20
guy here doing IRFX, Agri and maybe Equity.  We are also looking into Oil=
=20
deals, and have plans for Gas, Coal, Pulp & Paper, Credit and Emissions. Al=
so=20
EBS is on the way. I only see Metals, IRFX and Weather as active desks this=
=20
year, maybe Oil. Power will take some more time to get active, due to the=
=20
very closed market situation here right now. On the Origination side we mig=
ht=20
see some structures/cross commidity/finance deals go through. Thus we have =
a=20
mix of activites from Enron APACHI, Enron Global Markets, EBS and Enron=20
Metals. Basically everyone wants to do some business in Japan.

To coordinate all these activities we need to build the most cost efficient=
,=20
independent, segregated, automised and service minded Japanese Commercial=
=20
Support function possible. To accomplish these objectives, outsourcing to=
=20
Sydney is an alternative that has been discussed extensive lately, and is=
=20
highly recommended from our side. Labour costs in Sydney is 25% of the cost=
s=20
in Tokyo. Due to Sydney's experience and size they are ready to expand and=
=20
take on this project. They already have the segregation and independence in=
=20
place, and would give us an extra layer of segregation in the sense of bein=
g=20
an intermideary between Tokyo and Houston. Bilingual staff would be hired t=
o=20
perform Japanese services, which is widely available in Sydney. And there i=
s=20
only one hour in difference between us. Outsourcing these activities from=
=20
Japan to Australia is a growing trend, and many large corporations have don=
e=20
it this way.

There will be some time from the first trades until functions and commoditi=
es=20
are moved to Sydney. Tokyo want and needs to learn, understand all details,=
=20
automise, make routines and calibrate systems first. On the confirmation si=
de=20
our Legal department would be heavily involved in th start, compared to lat=
er=20
stages.

Proposed MO structure for Enron Japan

A) Responsibility for all Commercial Support activities in Japan to be=20
sourced to Enron Japan, under Enron Japan's CFO.

B) Outsource programmable tasks to Sydney:
 - Documentation (Capture & Confirmation)
 - Settlement
 - Trade Accounting

C) Risk Management in Tokyo.


I look forward to hear from you.
