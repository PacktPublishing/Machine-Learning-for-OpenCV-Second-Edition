Thanks for taking the time.  I appreciate it.  Hope all is going well (we 
haven't had much to talk about lately).

Best regards

Shona - 

I just wanted to make sure you knew what a great job Chris does as a liason 
between your group and Market Risk Management on all the DPR and limit 
issues.  He is extremely responsive to our (MRM) inquiries and requests for 
information, and has been instrumental in helping me gather information and 
understand the DPR reporting process so that I can prepare better and more 
meaninful analyses for the BOD and for Rick Buy.  And he's been a pleasure to 
work with throughout all the changes to the notification process, and appears 
willing to embrace suggestions on how to improve risk reporting processes 
further.

Your entire group's teamwork and work ethic has enabled me to add value in my 
new position here, and while I got the opportunity to express this via PEP 
for you and Eugenio, I didn't do a review on Chris, so I wanted to make sure 
you knew.

Regards,
Cassandra.
