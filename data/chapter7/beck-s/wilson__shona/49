I agree with the exception of point 3 below.  I plan for them to be one of 
several authorisers of bills (in no case however, the only authorisers).  
Also, I spoke to Sally about the "agency" office and she agrees that in the 
short term, the agency plan is what we need to implement.  However, a 
mentioned by both Ted and Sally, we need to discuss what the ultimate goal is 
for these offices (will they continue to exist?).  Let's call what we plan to 
implement now "Phase I".

Best regards

Subject: Re: Trading v Origination Offices  

Thanks - I think this is a good start as far as roles go, but as I outlined 
to Shona last week, we should apply some basic rules to the process, (forgive 
me if obvious) for example:

Rule 1: No confirmations issued, chased or matched by remote offices

This should be done centrally and further all the customers of the remote 
office should be given contact numbers (e.g. fax) at the operations hub. That 
way any incoming confirmations etc go to the independent ops group.

Rule 2: No cash payments or receipts in respect of transactions approved or 
reconciled by remote offices

Operations hubs should reconcile cash movements to changes in position.

Rule 3: No physical settlements or receipts in respect of transactions 
approved or reconciled by remote offices

This splits the logistics process somewhat, but is essentially as with cash 
in that every movement of physical product should be approved (where 
necessary) and reconciled to movements in the position at operations hubs. 
The "initiation/optimisation" aspect of logistics could remain remote, since 
arguably it involves pseudo - trading.

Not exhaustive but helpful I hope.

Subject: Trading v Origination Offices

Sally, Brent,
There are three MG offices in North America outside New York which, previous 
to the acquisition by Enron, acted much as trading offices.
Shona and Naomi have worked with the people in New York to put in place extra 
controls so that they are not trading offices, for example having a trader in 
New York or London own each book and sign off on profit daily.
This process has highlighted the fact that our non-trading offices are not 
all the same, and cannot reasonably all be the same.
Some offices organise logistics things to happen on the ground, some 
originate, and some execute for Trading Offices.

is a suggestion for how we can make this division explicit.
All the cc above are bought in to this approach.
What do you require to be comfortable so that we can put it up to Causey and 
Buy?

It is worth noting that this approach would have caught Helsinki, except for 
the Contract-in-a-bottom-drawer, but no system of control can reliably catch 
that, as was evidenced by EOTT.

Thanks,
Richard
