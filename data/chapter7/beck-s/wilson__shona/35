Dear Paul,

Thanks for the update.  Can you liase with Al Pennisi and Marcelo Parra to 
look at the R&N information?  We are trying to get a handle on how 
comfortable we are outsourcing the majority of the middle office for the US 
brokerage business.  Not just settlements, but nearly all functions.  Al is 
putting together some information regarding R&N.  Together with Al, Kevin 
Rhodes and Marcelo we should be able to come to a recommendation (either the 
middle office operations is something we should start to do ourselves, or 
that we think it is best to continue to use R&N as an outsourcer for the 
brokerage business).

If you want to discuss call me at 713 853 9123.

Regards

Shona

Hi Shona,

Ideally I think Will Morley (recent hire to London Documentation team) should 
be looking after the Documentation area as he is managing the London
side (I will confirm this)

On the Settlements side I am happy to look at the Rolfe & Nowlan side as I 
have around 10 years experience using and developing R&N in my
previous employments

thanks
