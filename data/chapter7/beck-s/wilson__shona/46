Dear Sally,

Attached is the latest version of the summary.  It is complete, but I'm still 
waiting for Scott E to let me know if anything has been done in Panama.

You mentioned yesterday that you wanted the offices rated.  I have put a 
rating in, based on the number comments, size of the office, and severity of 
the comments, and what I understand the general attitude of the office to be, 
but you should probably take a look at it since you attended some of these 
reviews.

Best regards

Shona
