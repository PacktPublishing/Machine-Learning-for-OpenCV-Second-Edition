Dear Kathy & Darren,
     I've spoken with Marcelo Parra here in New York regarding phone 
recording for the Enron Metals offices.  The RAC group insists that recording 
is done ASAP and I need to report back to Marcelo the install dates of the 
equipment in Montreal and St. Louis.  If you have such info or know who is 
responsible, please let me know.  
     I understand that we are several months away from the installation of a 
new switch with central recording capability here at the 520 Madison office 
in New York.   As an alternative, I can install a refurbished digital 
recording system for 24 telephones on the Concentrates and Metals trading 
desks for approximately $45,000.   The recording device will be located in 
our telephone room and is not accessible to the traders.  All equipment is in 
stock and we can have the desks recorded by December 1.   I need a quick 
approval since the vendor will only hold refurbished equipment until Friday 
afternoon for us.  Barry, can you give the OK?
    Also, recording for the Chicago office should not be an issue since the 
Enron Metals people are moving to the existing Enron Chicago facilities 
before the end of the year.

Best  regards,
Mike
