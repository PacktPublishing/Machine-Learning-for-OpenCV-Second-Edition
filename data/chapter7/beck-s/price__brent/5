I was going to write that the buying and selling of physical commodity 
locally was OK, but that hedging had to be done with Regional Hub. The 
problem with this model is that it describes Helsinki before the bust!

Another possiblity is the agency model, where the local trader acts under the 
direction of the hub trader. This is where Helsinki currently is (although we 
also have an independent manager on site). However, I am not so happy with 
this, and Rick Causey certainly does not like it. Perhaps we should recommend 
independent Risk Managers in every office, but all correspondence and 
settlement with regional hub?
