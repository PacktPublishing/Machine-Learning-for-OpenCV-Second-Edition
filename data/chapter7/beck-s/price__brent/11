Fernley - attached as discussed, initial gas & power operating standards for 
Houston.  We will use these as a basis for comparison with other offices and 
ultimately the development of global standards across the company.

Sally - you may have seen these already but I wanted to make sure you had a 
copy.

Call me with any questions or comments.
