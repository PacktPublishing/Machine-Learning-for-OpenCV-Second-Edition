I know we've made good progress with respect to morning reports for EGM.  
However, I continue to receive most reports after 9:00 a.m., which is too 
late into the trading day.  Please let me know if there are resources you 
need, so this aspect of EGM can run as smoothly as ENA gas.  

Thanks.

Jeff
