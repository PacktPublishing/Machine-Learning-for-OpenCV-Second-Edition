fyi - see Joel's status report below and my comments.  What I would like to 
do is start hosting a monthly meeting to give a status update on our 
projects.  What do you think ?

Good.  It is nice to get a recap of what's going on.

A few comments....

1) Can I see the OPM vision document?

2) MKM Phase I - what's included?  what's the business benefit?

3) MKM - Decommisioning of Phoenix.  I think you might be getting a little 
ahead of yourself here.  First you will need to integrate MKM with EnPower, 
Unify, and Sitara.  What are the plans for that?  I also think the delay in 
the Calculation component could be a problem.  For instance, we currently use 
spreadsheets to calculate the average prices and then key them into Unify 
(maybe Phoenix).  We do this because we don't have the ability to key 
anything into either Phoenix or MKM.  How will we do this if Phoenix goes 
away?  I want to make sure the process is thoroughly thought through here.

4) MKM - Support of both Phoenix and LIM is a duplication of efforts and 
costly.....   The plans here need to go back to the vision.  Where is the 
step by step plan of getting to the vision?

5) GRS Support - The most important interim priority is not reflected here 
which concerns me.  Because Reuters accuracy is so poor, the most critical 
thing we need is the ability to select an alternate source for pricing, such 
as CQG, for the downloads!

6) GRS Support - OPIS validation.  This is a business issue and I'm not sure 
this should be reflected in your status report, but you do need to make sure 
Steve gets on this.


Clearly from this, I think good coordination and project management is still 
lacking in the Rates/MKM world.  Is Stuart calling the shots (Phoenix 
decommisioning) or are we?
