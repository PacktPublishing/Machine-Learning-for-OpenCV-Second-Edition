Hi Nicki,
Thanks for setting up the meeting next Wednesday (9/20) at 2:30 with M.=20
Frevert, D. Delainey, J. Shankman, and J. Lavorato.  Here is a brief overvi=
ew=20
of the meeting objective:

Purpose
To gain support and approval for a data warehouse vision containing=20
consolidated trade information with centralized access.

Background
The definition of a data warehouse is a place to consolidate information=20
originating from multiple transaction processing systems and platforms into=
 a=20
common database repository.  The idea of an Enron =01&Trade Warehouse=018=
=20
originated from members of the London office and has been expanded to inclu=
de=20
the Houston systems.  The need for a Trade Warehouse stems from the=20
requirement of multiple departments needing to access consolidated deal=20
information for analytical reporting and down-stream processing.   Currentl=
y,=20
deal information is held in separate trading systems both within product=20
process flows from mid to back office, and across product lines. The=20
information is also stored across multiple system platforms and is not easi=
ly=20
accessible or consistently presented across the various trading products=20
within Enron. Given this current architecture, it is very difficult and=20
costly to access timely, quality-assured, and consolidated cross-product de=
al=20
information for analytical reporting and down-stream processing.

Proposal
Houston will use the warehouse as the data source for EnTelligence and=20
numerous analytical reporting application systems.  These analytical=20
reporting application systems can include, but are not limited to,=20
Operational Pricing Module (OPM), EnronOnline, and Daily Position Report=20
(DPR).  Once the warehouse is in place, it may be used as the source for=20
additional downstream systems as well as Investor Relations reporting.
