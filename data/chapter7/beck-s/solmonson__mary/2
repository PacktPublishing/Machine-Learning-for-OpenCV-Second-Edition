I enjoyed speaking with you last week.  As promised, below are proposed
times for a meeting in Houston to explore the opportunity we have to
offer in more detail.  I have also spoken with representatives in Enron
Online regarding your desire to receive a feed of deal data from EOL and
should have someone available to discuss potential solutions with you.

Here are some proposed dates/times to pick from.  Let me know what suits
your schedule best.  We're thinking we'll spend the first bit of time
giving you an overview of what we're working on and proposing and then
go from there.  We'll probably spend at most 2 hours in this first
meeting.

Wednesday 3/7    anytime between 10-5
Thursday     3/8  anytime between 8-12
Friday         3/9  anytime between 11-5

We would also enjoy the opportunity to treat you to lunch if scheduling
permits.  Let me know which day/time works best for you and I will
proceed with finalizing the schedule.
