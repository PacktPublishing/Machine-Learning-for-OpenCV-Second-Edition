First of all....I hope you are feeling well...with all of the emails going 
back and forth I haven't taken the time to say so...

I just spoke with Lou Santorie with Sempra.  He said that they are very 
interested in Confirm Corp and would be looking for a company to partner 
with.  He said that basically "if Enron would decide to use this application" 
that the industry would have to get on board...basically sounds like he feels 
that we would set the stage for what is used in the industry as far a 
clearing applications.

We had a brainstorming meeting with the Commodity Logic team at 
lunch....their concepts are good for Phase I but we would get the biggest 
bang from their later Phase concept where they intend to do the automatching 
of deal info. between us and the Counterparty......
