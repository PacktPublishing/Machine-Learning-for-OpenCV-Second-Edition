You might want to attend this meeting if you can.  We did some brainstorming 
today on what / how a Commodity Logic payment module should be and came up 
with some options that are quite revolutionary.  It entails some risk, but 
also has revenue potential as well.  We want to run it by both you and Tom to 
see if this is a direction you want to head.

If you're not available, then I can spend time with you to give you the 
overview.
