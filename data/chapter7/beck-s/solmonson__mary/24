Mary,

Thanks for your interest, I will add you.

The meeting arose out of a need to identify where clearing needs to be in the 
future.  Legal will address
the legal implications of confirming web based deals.  It was rumored at one 
time that the web based receipt  was sufficient for confirmation of the 
deal.  

This issue as well as many others will be discussed.

Clearing users from London, Calgary, and Houston will have a chance to 
present their requirements. These requirements will  include
a need for web based clearing,  the nature of which  Commodity Logic is 
developing.  We are currently working closely with the Commodity Logic 
project  in
order to assure that the entire process of clearing deals as it exists today  
can be made as efficient as possible.

Web based clearing will be one of many requirements we hope to flush out 
during these meetings,  Based on the requirements we will
work with London to develop a plan that get us where we need to be.

Thanks for the invite, I will try and make it.

Ron

Ron, please add me to the list for attendance.  I have just a few questions, 
if you could answer them for me.

Who is requesting/spearheading this meeting?  How does this meeting relate to 
the requirements gathering already done / being done by Commodity Logic?
Isn't this a somewhat redundant effort, albeit a more organized approach?  In 
other words, why would we start a second effort without coordinating it with 
the Commodity Logic effort ?  Are you in competition or something?

Additionally, I should inform you that a company called ConfirmCorp offers a 
service for confirm clearing.  They are coming in Tuesday afternoon to make a 
presentation.  It's probably a good idea if you attend.  The meeting is in 
49c4.  I will call you with additional information.

Tommy,

The  purpose of these meetings is to flush out a consensus of what clearing 
needs to be in the future.  

We have invited interested parties from London, Calgary and Houston.  Folks 
from Clearing, Legal, Credit, Commodity Logic, and LiveLink have been
invited.

We are asking Legal to clearly define the legal implications of web trading.  
We expect Web based clearing to be a hot topic; CommodityLogic can
represent a piece to the clearing puzzle.

Attached is a tentative agenda.  Let me know if you have any ideas for making 
this as productive as possible.

Thanks, Ron
