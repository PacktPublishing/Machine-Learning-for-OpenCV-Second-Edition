These are the preliminary results of the Global Systems audit.  Not too bad.

fyi, my comments are:

SAP interface - we discussed an improved solution for implementation in 4th 
Quarter earlier this week

Inactive Employees, etc - In the absence of a corporate process for keeping 
this updated, the Global Managers do periodically review who has access and 
request changes to access based upon their knowledge of current employee 
assignments.  At best, this is a quarterly process.

Passwords -  they are right.  We probably need something.

Stuart,

We have completed our work on the Global Systems (Counterparty, Contracts, 
Facilities, and Common Codes) in accordance with the Enron North America 2000 
Audit Plan.  We met with Sundar Chitradurga and Ravi Arumbakkam on the IT 
side and Mary Solmonson on the business side in order to gain an 
understanding of the application and its environment.  We were provided the 
documentation we requested and are pleased with the cooperation we received.  
We appreciate them making time to work with us in completing this audit.

We have closed our preliminary issues with Sundar and Ravi and we agree on 
the items in the report.  I am attaching a copy of the preliminary report for 
your review.  At Enron's request, the reporting date for the currently open 
business audits has been moved to this Friday, the 20th of October.  They 
were originally scheduled to report on the 27th.

We would like to give you an opportunity to read through this report and meet 
with us to discuss any areas of concern prior to Friday's reporting.  We are 
available today, the 18th, throughout the afternoon and all day tomorrow, 
Thursday the 19th.  I will also call you this afternoon to discuss meeting to 
go over each of these issues.  If you are comfortable with this report and do 
not feel it is necessary for us to meet and discuss it, please let me know.  
After we have agreed on the accuracy of all issues, they will be placed in 
the final reporting format.  We will provide you a copy of the final report 
when it is completed.

We appreciate your cooperation and efforts in this regard.

Thanks,

Russ Bouwhuis
