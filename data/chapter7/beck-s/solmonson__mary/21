See the comment below on Williams' confirmation site.  Sounds similar to what 
we are proposing on CL.  One question I'm exploring right now is whether we 
could save more money from an Enron perspective and achieve greater 
marketability with the model that ConfirmCorp proposes with automated 
matching vs. the Commodity Logic/Williams approach that depends on users 
reviewing/approving confirms (we've simply put the current process online so 
to speak).  We need to push for a more radical change/improvement on a faster 
timeline.   I still believe confirms is the correct area to be focusing on, 
as I mentioned in our meeting with Louise, but we need to seriously review 
what we propose to deliver and how.  Is ConfirmCorp a viable company to bring 
under the Enron umbrella?

I think we should be concerned that late entry with less functionality will 
erode our ability to sign up customers.  I don't think each large marketer 
will want to log in to several sites to clear their confirmations with each 
of their large counterparties.

Can we find out if Williams has further plans for their service that would 
compete with Commodity Logic?

Dear Ron:

I recently sent you information relating to ConfirmCorp via FedEx.  I trust 
you have received it by now.  If you have any questions, please do not 
hesitant to call.  I will follow up with you in one week.

Regards,

PS Williams Energy just came out with "Williams CustomerFirst", a website 
that contains all their confirmations.  While eliminating faxes, this puts 
the onus of verification on the counterparty and assumes there is a 
confirmation staff on the other end to do the checkout.  ConfirmCorp will 
make even this advanced approach obsolete.
