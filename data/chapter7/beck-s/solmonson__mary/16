I am putting together an analysis of these guys right now since they just 
came on the scene.  I want to talk to Tom more about this company before I 
finish the document because he has a great contact there. The JV with Prebon 
Yamane is not that strong but having Amerex and The Bank of New York is 
huge.  Please keep me informed of any other information you hear about Energy 
Clear or any other potential competition.  Thanks.

James
