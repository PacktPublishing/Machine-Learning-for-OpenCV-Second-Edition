Ryan, thank you for your timely response.   It is a concern of mine that our 
current test sytems does not represent the current production system.  I feel 
we run a large risk by not adequately testing a product and all associated 
processes prior to moving it into production.  My concerns are based on the 
following: 

The volume of data that ENA puts into the Livelink system daily, and 
ultimately into iRIMS, exceeds any load testing that OpenText has done. 
 Due to our volume, without testing it is unknown if the performance will be 
adequate.  
There is an inherent risk to putting such a heavy volume application into 
production without proper load testing.
Being the test database server is not the same as the production database 
server, how will we ever know if the application will work?  More so, how 
will we be able to test the restore procedures?
iRIMS testing will include custom modules for iRIMS/Livelink migration.  This 
will require testing of "adding classifications" to  massive amounts of 
LiveLink folders.  The current volume is somewhere around 500,000 folders.  
It is my understanding the current test system can not handle this volume.  
The implementation of iRIMS effects the Livelink repository which needs to be 
tested as well.  There is some concern as to; can the current test system 
accommodate this.  

The question of having another Unix 4500 which will give us an identical test 
database or something smaller that might accomplish the same end result is 
one I can not answer.  However,  I would look to you and your technical team 
for recommendations in this matter and would agree to serving on the 
evaluation team.

If you have any questions please feel free to call me at 58841 and as usual, 
thank you for your help and support on this project.

Regards,


Joel

Hi Joel,
 The project plan at this point is very preliminary.  There will be a revised 
(more accurate) plan by the end of next week when OTPS and EDMS have time to 
meet with Carolyn and Barbara.  This is scheduled for next Wed.

This is complete;
Server for iRIMS Beta 9.0 is at Ardmore
iRIMS Test has been created (Oracle)
Test Data from EDMS Test is being copied at this time


Do you want me to purchase another Unix 4500 for Livelink (300K) that will 
give us an identical test database or should I look at getting a smaller less 
expensive Unix box?  Please inform and I will move ahead.

Thanks in advance,

rlo

Ryan, being there was not a meeting this past Monday, can I please have a 
status on where we are on the project.  I am particularly interested in where 
we stand against the plan


Thanks


Joel
