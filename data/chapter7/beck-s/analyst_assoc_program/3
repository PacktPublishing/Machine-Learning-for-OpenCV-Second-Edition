Sally,
I received your voicemail this morning and I believe the following will 
answer all your questions:

1.  We are actually fine on Friday night dinners and really only need 
interviewers at this time.

2.  For the first weekend - Oct. 28th - To date, I don't see that anyone from 
your area has signed up to interview.  This may be because this is an 
Associate weekend.

3.  For the second weekend - Nov. 4th - The only person signed up is Pat 
Clynes from Logistics.  The second weekend is really large and we still need 
about 67 interviewers.  We are looking for Managers and above to interview.


4.  Attending schools  October 28th - approx. 55 students (Associate) 
    Georgetown
    Rice - Grad
    Michigan
    Thunderbird
    UT- Grad

    November 4th - approx. 100 students (Analyst)
    UT- Undergrad
    A&M
    Baylor
    Rice - Undergrad
    Oklahoma
    Florida

5.  Interviewers must check in at 8:00am for interview discussion and 
breakfast - 50M.  They will pick up their schedule and candidate resumes at 
this time.

6.  Interviewers will see 5 candidates and will be assigned to a interview 
team.  Interviews will be conducted between 8:45 - 12:15.

7.  Interviewer/Candidate lunch will be from 12:30-1:30 - The Energizer

8.  The decision making meeting will begin at 1:30pm in 5C2.  All 
interviewers must attend the decision making meeting.

If you have any additional questions, please let me know.  We would greatly 
appreciate your continued support in getting additional interview 
participants.  Thanks so much.
