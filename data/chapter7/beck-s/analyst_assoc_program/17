It has been a long time and I hope all is well with you and your family.  

Brenda Herod advised me that we are pending a speaker from the Energy 
Operations group.  Please note that we are in deadline phrase of the project 
and with the holiday weekend approaching, wrap up this pending item.   I 
understand that your group is especially busy with SAP and PRC activities and 
look forward to receiving the speaker's name and bio.  I can assist with 
writing the bio if that individual does not have a bio.    If you have not 
located a candidate, how about a complete presentation to entice the speaker 
?   Attached please find the Energy Operations presentation.  



Your commitment to the orientation is appreciated and please call me at 
x33597 if you have any questions.  Thank you.
