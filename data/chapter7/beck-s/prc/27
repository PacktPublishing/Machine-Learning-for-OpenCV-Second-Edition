You asked yesterday if any of us had any comments on the Analyst PRC 
process...  I thought I would share a few things with you.  The primary 
concern was that an individual was representing "our" people, and they 1) did 
not know them 2) did not know what they did 3) probably could not adequately 
answer questions about that person and his/her performance and job 
responsibilities.  Although I think the manager's in my group did an 
excellent job of providing feedback and accomplishments (the two analysts 
rankings in our group did not change from excellent), they were really uneasy 
about someone independent of our group representing them.  

Also, in general, it seems like the analysts are getting conflicting messages 
about the "third" rotation and the option of going back to school, staying 
with the company, etc.  I think a good idea would be to provide some clear, 
written message to the analysts and us about the program and how it is going 
to work going forward.  It surer seems like it changes every 6 months...  

Hope this helps!  Let me know if you have any questions.
