Thanks for the update on the timing of my review.  For your information, I am 
already signed up for the November 13-14th session of the Executive Influence 
& Impact course.

Subject: Update on PRC Process for VP's

Today's ENA PRC was a pre-ranking session for VP's.  All VP's will be 
reviewed at an Enron-wide PRC scheduled for early August.  Representatives at 
that Enron PRC from ENA will be Janet Dietriech, Dave Delainey, John Lavorato 
and Greg Piper.  They will use information from today's ENA PRC meeting in 
representing you at the Enron-wide VP PRC.  I have provided copies of your 
accomplishments and consolidated supervisor feedback forms to Dave Delainey 
for reference during that process.  

Your reviews will be given after the Enron-wide VP PRC, and will not be 
completed before the end of July.  I will schedule an August date with you 
for your review as soon as I know the exact date of the final PRC meeting.  

Separately, you both should sign up for the Executive Influence and Impact 
course that is required of VP's.  I thought that the course was very good.  
All VP's are strongly encouraged to complete this course.  It is a 2 or 3 day 
course that is offered every month or two here in Houston.  I would contact 
Dick Amiable to inquire on how to sign up for this.
