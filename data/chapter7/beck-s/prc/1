After all of the chaos and discontent over the AEP / HPL situation, I thought I would convey some first hand comment in regard to Bob Hall.  Every person that has spoken to me about the AEP / HPL situation, has had nothing but praise for the fair and compassionate way that Bob has dealt with some very difficult situations.  Through my personal observations, I know that he has also done a great job of keeping the ultimate goal of a June closing on track, in the face of  huge obstacles.

Since this is PRC time, I thought I would share this with you.

If you have any questions or would like some more particulars, please feel to give me a call at x36674 or shoot me an email.
