Sally, 
I think that Shona is taking the right approach with Eugenio.    I'm 
attending the follow up meetings with Shona and Eugenio.   We are hopeful 
that this will work out.   We have not turned the corner yet on communication 
issues.

I spoke with Tom about finding the correct training for you.  He also feels 
that attending all of the classes you are currently signed up for in Ernie is 
not the right approach.  He wants to meet with you to discuss this.  
Currently, we believe the best approach to be:

Attending successful working relationships - he will ensure you get into this 
class
Attending communicating effectively for leaders - you are already signed up
Do 1 on 1 coaching - he is currently looking for someone who would fit 
Attending a 360 class - these are few and far between.  He is looking for one.

Tom and Hector are trying to figure what classes present soft skills in a 
format that you will be familiar with - essentially a class that puts a 
quantitative spin on soft skills (these are obviously a bit harder to find).

Thanks

Shona
