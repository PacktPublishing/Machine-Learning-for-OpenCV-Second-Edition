Subject: Backtesting Graphs for SemiVariance VaR


Per your request, please review the graphs below for comparision of 
backtesting results between the current VaR model and the same model
using semivariance.  In conclusion, the proposed VaR tuning (RLPM)
backtests as well as the current method given the data sample used.
Gary has requested that this method be approved and adopted 
as the current method is not reflecting only the directional risk associated
with his positions.  Upon approval, method can be implemented immediately.
