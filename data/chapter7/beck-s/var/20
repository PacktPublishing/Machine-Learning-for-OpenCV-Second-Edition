Sally,
Angela Sprock forwarded your VM to me regarding the VAR training that you 
were looking to set up for your group.

I've taken the liberty of getting in touch with the suppliers to talk to them 
about the request and their availability. As well as discussing putting on 
the 2 day course solely for you group, I also discussed with them the 
possibility of breaking it up and delivering it in shorter  modules. Although 
they considered this, they are insistent that the course structure, the 
activities and the content lend themselves better to the 2 day format. 
They are a very busy company, in much demand both within Enron and other 
companies. Their earliest available dates are: September 14-15, and September 
21-22.

Alternatively, they have more flexibility on dates later in the year (October 
onwards - but that may be less of a fit).

How does this fit with your group?
Let me know if you want to discuss this further
