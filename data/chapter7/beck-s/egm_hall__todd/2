Brent and Sally,

After speaking with Richard Burchfield and Brian Hudson, I thought that it 
would be appropriate to update both of you and Beth as to IT's commitment.  
Richard asked that he send out the message and I agreed.  One reason for 
doing this was to show that the Operations and IT groups are working together 
towards a common goal.  The other reason was to ensure that I had IT's buy-in 
to completing this database in a timely fashion.

Our main goal will be to deliver the basic tools that any trading business 
would need and then to continue to develop the more advanced analytics in Q1 
2001.  The actual roll out will happen in phases prior to January so that we 
begin the new year with a complete database which includes deal capture, 
valuation, and the necessary reporting and accounting tools.  By using Brian 
Hudson's IT team I can be assured that the global needs are met.

I will be in the office next week if you want to discuss this further,

Todd

Todd,
 Per our discussion on moving forward with the development of a Weather 
Trading and Valuation engine.  I have discussed the high level requirements 
with Joseph Koothrappaly and have identified an IT lead to manage the 
project. As discussed, the project will have the same project formula as the 
"Thunderball" project with 3-6 month deliverables. Also, the need to have 
co-operative development between Houston and London will be established for 
Global roll out of the Weather system. The main focus will be a intranet 
trade capture and position with a callable valuation engine. The plan calls 
for Phase I roll out for January 1, 2001.   Next steps will need to be 
discuss as soon as possible.  Topics that need to be addressed are definition 
of Phase I, joint development between Houston and London, and duel 
development between Steve Stock's valuation team and my trading team. Keep in 
mind that though multiple teams will have development assignments, one person 
will manage the effort across teams.


Richard
