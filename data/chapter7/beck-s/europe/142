Barry,
please make sure that someone in the DPR - Houston team gets these memos as 
well.
I would recommend copying Mike Moscoso on any notices that you send me.
I am sure that it is confusing, but eventually we will get it right.
Thanks
Ted

BP - You were going to send the limit violation memo previously forwarded to 
T Murphy on APX as well (ie. P&L)?  It will be easier to get this from you as 
Murphy is out on business.  When do you expect to complete the memo for the 
incremental (10MM) loss on the APX positions to be run through today's DPR?  
Going forward, make sure to copy both Port and I on this and similar items.  
Thanks.
