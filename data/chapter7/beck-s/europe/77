Sally,
Jeff Skilling mentioned today that gas volume growth in ENA was still about 
97% year on year.
I don't know how much of this is increased number of trades and how much is 
increased volume per trade.

We are currently preparing a zero-base estimate of future support costs to 
assess the benefits v costs of all projects.
Assuming that the business in Europe will develop in a similar way to 
America, but a few years behind, it would be most useful to have some more 
statistics for several years back.
Who in your team has some more statistics on numbers of trades which could 
help us?

Many thanks,
Richard
