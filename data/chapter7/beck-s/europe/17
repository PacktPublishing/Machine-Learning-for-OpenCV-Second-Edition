Sally - Thanks. I will bring some pictures with me when I come to Houston !

I have arranged to come over from the 14th to the 20th of March inclusive to 
cover a number of things including some doorstep work. Will you have an hour 
to see me sometime over this period ?

Patti - Could you please arrange for me to have the use of a desk for this 
period ? I will bring my laptop so I will only need somewhere where I can get 
hooked up.

Thanks James

Subject: Congratulations

I asked Mike this week if your baby was here, and he said that you had just 
returned to the office.  Congratulations on the birth of your little girl.  I 
hope that all three of you are surviving those first few weeks of adjustment 
and that sleep is not too short a commodity in your house!   I will look 
forward to seeing pictures of Lauren when I am next in London.  You do know 
that now that you are a dad that it is a requirement to be armed with 
adorable pictures at all times?!
