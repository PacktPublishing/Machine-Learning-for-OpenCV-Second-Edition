Subject:	EnVision Meeting Structures and Way Forwards


At the last EnVision Project meeting the following presentation was given and agreed in principal as the way we will take things forwards.  Whilst the names within each area have to be confirmed and agreed I thought that it would be useful to circulate this as many of you will be impacted.  I will be communicating this further over the next few days, but if you have any immediate questions please feel free to contact me.

Regards
