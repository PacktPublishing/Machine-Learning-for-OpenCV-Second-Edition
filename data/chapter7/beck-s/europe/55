At the meeting I was told 2 weeks to a month out.  I think they would like to 
start earlier and probably came over here with that intention, but they still 
have some legal, tax and obviously back office things to sort out (so 
basically as soon as commercially possible!).

They flew back to Houston today, so I expect to hear more details in a couple 
of days (after they chase down some legal and tax issues).  In the meantime, 
we need to get with Brenda and her group to sort out the back office details 
as soon as possible.  As you know, Global Products is currently only 
supporting 10-15 financial trades per month (confirms and settlements through 
ECTRIC).

Regards,
Shelly

Thanks for the call.  Brenda Herod is the operations controller for EIM. 
(Brenda and Brent in their roles over EIM and EGM, respectively, are both 
direct reports of mine.)  Brenda is out of the country through the end of 
this week on vacation, touring Europe with her mom.  If there is a need to 
address this issue this week, let me know and I can start down that road 
until Brenda returns.  Let me know. 

I did hear an unsubstantiated rumor this week that Clickpaper.com is set to 
go live in London within 5 days.  I am trying to find out if that is true.   
If it is, it would be a repeat of a commercial decision in Houston to do so 
this past July without letting anyone in the mid and back office know.  We 
had to scramble to set up an infrastructure to support that in a big hurry.  
Not ideal.  I hope that history has not repeated itself.  Let me know if you 
have heard anything on this.
