Hi Sally

Sorry for not getting back to you yesterday!

Would 8.30am this morning suit you to connect with John over the phone?

I have blocked from 2.30pm to 3.00pm in his diary for you - please let me 
know if this suits you.

Thank you.

Lauren

Subject: London Resources


It is too late in the day in London for me to catch you by phone today.  I 
will call you tomorrow and would like to throw out an idea regarding an 
on-going resource for operations in London.  If you are comfortable with my 
idea, then I can discuss it in person with Fernley while he is here this 
week.  We have time on the calendar plus dinner this week.
