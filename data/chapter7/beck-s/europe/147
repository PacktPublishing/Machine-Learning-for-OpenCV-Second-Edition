Jan Erland has just called me from Oslo, he told me Brent & Bjorn are due 
over there next week.

I guess I'm a touch surprised no one told me, as Jan Erland reports to me. He 
is Local Office Controller.  I'm assuming it will be a 'post-Helsinki' type 
review, right? Is there any particular things they/you would like to look at 
or discuss?

As you know we operate some of the IBS functions from Oslo and some from 
London. I'm happy to discuss this further. Do your people need an 
introduction to the operation etc...?

Hope your well, Barry.
