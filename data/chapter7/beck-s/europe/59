Dear Sally,

Just to keep you in the loop, Naomi's group is responsible for all of the 
Enron Europe remote offices and is a great resource to keep us updated on 
what each office is really doing.  We are hoping her group can help us 
determine which offices have origination/trading or are near doing these 
types of activities, as well as what offices have other activities.

We are putting together a short checklist that her team will fill out for 
each office.  Based on that, we can determine whether to scope the office 
into our doorstep review.

Thanks

Shona

Dear Naomi,

As always - good talking to you yesterday.  Based on the discussions you and 
I have had recently, Cassandra and I are in the process of drafting a process 
whereby we receive information from you and your group to help update our 
understanding of the Enron Europe remote offices.  This will allow us to 
better determine which offices to scope into the doorstep review and 
hopefully lessen the doorstep work required from Mike's resources.

I'll send something to you early next week.

Have a good weekend,

Shona
