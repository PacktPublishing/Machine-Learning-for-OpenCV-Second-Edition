fyi...

Ted,

As discussed, please see below an outline of the changes that we are making 
to the Logistics set-up in London. I also attach the Roles & Responsibilities 
document we discussed - I highlight in red the sections that have been agreed 
with the functional groups... 

Sally,

Sorry to have missed you this week. I hope to have the opportunity to explain 
to you in greater detail the changes we are making to the logistics function 
in Europe. We hope to replicate this model to Singapore and possibly Houston 
once we have proven the model in London.

I will also forward you a plan that we have kicked off to migrate trading 
support for the Helsinki operation back to London...

Regards,
Tim

Subject: Project "Q"

Hi,

I'd like to summarise the various discussions that have taken place over the 
last few days in relation to our forthcoming Logistics project, which I've 
tentatively named "Project Q". At some point a prize will be awarded to 
whoever can guess what the "Q" stands for...

Objective

Project "Q" has a twofold objective:

1) Implement the Co-ordination function for the London and Helsinki Global 
Trading Support group - see attached for a definition of this function 

2) Roll out the Products Inventory Management System ("PIMS") for the London 
and Helsinki Global Trading Support groups.

Target Timescale

Completion of both objectives is currently planned for the end of May. David 
and I have hastily put together a timeline which we will refine as a group at 
a Kick-Off meeting scheduled for next Friday, by which time the project team 
will be assembled in London - see attached .

To meet this tight timeframe, the scope of the project needs to be clearly 
understood especially in relation to rolling out PIMS. Though over time 1) 
functionality may be added to PIMS, 2) there will (hopefully) be a further 
deployment in Houston and Singapore, 3) an interface to RightAngle may be 
developed, 4) invoicing may be added etc... - for the purpose of this project 
the scope of the PIMS application is limited to replacing MANIPS for the 
Helsinki and London Operators (Petchems may or may not be included in this 
phase). The actual PIMS specification will be finalised next week by Graham 
and David (IT are currently mid-way through a full elaboration for the 
system).

Project Team

Steering group will comprise me (also Sponsor), Graham and Becky.

Project Manager is Cindy (arriving from Houston on Tuesday).

IT lead for PIMS is David Rae (full time for duration of project), managed by 
Iain Greig.

A Task Force comprising three contract accountants is being assembled and 
will be in place by the middle of next week.

Other stakeholders/key participants in this project are Logistics in London 
and Helsinki. The result of this project should be to leverage our existing 
operators and improve controls by introducing a second tier support around 
the Logistics function. However, for this to happen a significant 
contribution will be required from all our Operators to ensure a successful 
implementation within our timeframe.

Regards,
Tim
