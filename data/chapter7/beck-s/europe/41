I would welcome the opportunity to walk you through these presentations if 
you have time. It has been 6 weeks - 2 months since we did an integration 
update for Rick and hopefully this will demonstrate that we are out of 
integration and managing more in the line as if it was any other business - 
with it's usual set of problems.

I am also using this report to update Joe Gold who has been moved by the 
office of the chair to President of the EnronMetals Group 

Hope all is well 

Mike

Please find attached two presentations on current position/challenges with 
the Metals group and inventory balances in particular. 

The former outlines the 'Control' view of integration efforts - past, current 
and urgent future
The latter is a summarised response to your earlier concerns over inventory 

I look forward to discussing these with you at 9.30am / 15.30 pm ( London ).

Mike
