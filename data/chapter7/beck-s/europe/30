Gary

This follows on from discussions with RAC regarding what the softs broker 
traders are authorised for i.e. broking. If we are going to have them trading 
positions then this needs to be transparent.

I'm in Germany tommorrow but can be reached on my mobile +44 7973 740 478 if 
you wish to discuss.

Regards
Andy

I have given Nigel Majurey and James Willis discretion to trade 3,000 mt of 
our 6,000 mt outright position limit. Andy tells me I should have asked your 
authority to delegate. Can you confirm your approval or disapproval please
