Subject: Houston visit and doorsteps

Mike the following 2 doorstep dates have been agreed

5/3 EES for 10 days Paul
19/3 Interest rates, FX Coralie

David Wall are intending on going out on Tuesday the 13th. David will leave 
on Friday the 16th and I will leave on Tuesday the 20th. I will therefore be 
able to help the guys (if necessary) of fully pursue my own agenda which is 
enough in itself.

Is this OK with you ?
