Would be glad to discuss opportunities - can you help me by sending a brief 
background of your academic and work experience ( it would help me in putting 
you in touch with the most relevent of my directors/direct reports.

Regards

Mike

Mike-

I am currently looking for a new position in Commercial Support.  Sally Beck 
suggested I get in touch with you to determine if there are any needs in 
Enron Europe, especially any that might be here in Houston.  I'm available to 
speak throughout the day at 713-345-6976.  I can also contact you at your 
convenience.

Thanks,

Joe Short
