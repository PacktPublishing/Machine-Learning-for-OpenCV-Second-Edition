I am asking my assistant, Lauren to set up a video conference to discuss the 
support services that Enron Europe is providing and how we
should move forward to make these more responsive to your needs, as well as 
more efficient.   We will have a number of classic "centralized versus 
decentralized" matters to resolve and I doubt if one size will fit all.  Keep 
in mind that we have no desire to expand our empire.  In fact, from our 
perspective if our non-commerical headcount got smaller it would be a great 
outcome.  But the way it is has been going lately, we have been adding 
non-commerical headcount at a record pace at the same time that each of us is 
trying to massively expand our commercial business.  

We put a freeze on non-commerical hires earlier this week while we try and 
assess our space limitations and plan for the 2001 budge, so this is 
important that we get your perspective soon on what will work for you.

Global Markets has already moved some of these services under Brent Price in 
Houston but there are many other services which we need to consider as well 
such as:
IT development
IT infrastructure
RAC
Credit
Risk Management
Legal
Accounts Payable
Tax
Building Services
Analyst & Associate recruiting
Senior recruiting
Expat services
Other HR
PR
Governmental Relations
SFA relations
Finance

I hate to think that we will need to form a committee to work this issue, but 
that is a possibility.  If you have any suggestions for a process for working
these issues through, please send them out to this group or bring them to our 
upcoming meeting.

John
