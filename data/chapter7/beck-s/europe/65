All

Sally Beck, and I discussed sometime ago the need for a meeting of the key=
=20
business unit controllers across all commodities and locations, to promote=
=20
a global contact network ( surprisingly, this is absent with only a few=20
business unit controllers known outside of their location )
common standards and best practices
a defined role of business controller - to raise the bar for these key peop=
le
common infrastructure  - where possible, given the timing/importance of=20
individual business priorities
a focus on assessing operational risk within businesses - that should lend=
=20
itself to cross prioritisation of 'Corporate' resources / attention

Given my definition of the role of a business controller .....=20
provide the overall operational risk assessment facing the business unit
assess the capacity constraints within the full business process - front to=
=20
back - and design mitigation strategies to ensure continued growth despite=
=20
barriers
provide the single point of contact for support the business unit heads=20
Own the validitation process of the business balance sheet
Own the implementation plans for the business risk systems ( the total=20
rewrite of the documentation, settlement and trade accounting systems are=
=20
owned by me )
identify, recruit and manage the talent pool within the risk function of th=
e=20
business unit
identify opportunities to make the support infrastructure a commercial=20
competetive advantage

I have planned to take the following staff to the conference in Houston
Mike Jordan  European Middle Office
James New  Gas, Power and Credit Controller=20
Mike Wellings   UK Power Controller
Coralie Evans  Continental Power Controller
Robert Yeo  UK and Continental Gas Controller
Paul D=01,Arcy  Structured Transactions Controller
David Wall  Credit Controller
Andrew Cornfield Metals' Risk Manager ( representing Kevin Rhodes & Howard=
=20
Carter )

This is an investment in our key risk staff and I believe the upside from=
=20
their participation is significant. However, I have been keen to minimise=
=20
costs and time out of the office ( by flying on Sunday ) and have obtained=
=20
'discounts' where possible. The cost per person for the trip equates to=20

Economy Flights for all   o401 + tax of o56
Hotel     $250 for 2 nights
Share of meals / entertainment cost $300 for 2 nights ( estimated )

Total EEL budget for offsite   $10,000=20

Additionally  - taking all the lead risk managers / controllers out of the=
=20
office for 2 working days represents a risk - however this is mitigated by=
=20
the cover now in place below this team ( who are actually 'doing' the proce=
ss=20
) and the fact that the offsite is in Houston which would allow us to log o=
n=20
from the houston office within a few hours of being contacted by mobile pho=
ne.
