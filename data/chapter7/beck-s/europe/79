Proposed list - of all potential candidates

Myself
James New - and his lead risk managers
Mike Wellings - UK Power
Coralie Evans - Continental Power
Robert Yeo - UK and Continental Gas
Paul D'Arcy - Structured Products
David Wall - Credit
Tim Poullain-Patterson - Metals Integration
Andrew Cornfield - Metals Risk Manager
Kevin Rhodes - Metals Controller ( there are in fact two controllers at 
present Kevin for Financial Trading and Howard Carter for Merchanting )

I would leave Ralph Jaeger of Frankfurt out of the offsite if places are 
restricted  - He is covered by the mainstream Accounting conferences, but I 
would have Jan Erland, and Heidi and Tiong Hock from Singapore.

I am not sure Fernley would want to be there - but I can ask.

On others  - Simon Thurbin of liquids in london should be in Houston and 
would be a good choice for inclusion. Brent may want his two London 
controllers of Cindy Horn and Kenny Nicoll to also come

Would you invite Kristen to come with( in place of Barry? ).

A long list ( and we may want to cut back ) but all these individuals carry 
the burden of operational risk assessment and management - standardising that 
process would be an achievement indeed.

Mike

PS  - Shall we revisit Agenda and discuss who should start preparing 
presentations - we had thought about engaging RAC, IT etc
