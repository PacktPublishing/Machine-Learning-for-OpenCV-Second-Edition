Dear Sally,

I'm looking forward to start working on the 22nd.  I've arranged to have the
first day orientation as well as PC training on this date, which will last
until about 4:30.

I'm putting together some thoughts on how to best "kick off" my roles and
responsibilities and was wondering if you would be able to meet at 4:30 on
the 22nd to go over this.

I'm available through tomorrow at 713 356 4086 and the rest of the week at
713 628 7570.

Best regards,

Shona
