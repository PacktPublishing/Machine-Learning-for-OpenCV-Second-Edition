Subject: Oct. 17 RRC letter re continuing audit violations

 I just received a letter from Ed Abrahamson at the Railroad Commission, 
asserting that we have still not fully corrected or explained all of the 
audit violations they previously alleged.  I will have delivered to each of 
you this afternoon a copy of the letter, to which we must respond by October 
27.  The tone of the letter indicates some frustration on the audit staff's 
part, and it will behoove us to try to get the remaining matters resolved 
promptly.
 I will be out of town Monday, but I will have my assistant, Monica Jackson, 
set up a meeting for Tuesday afternoon to discuss how we are going to satisfy 
the Commission regarding the remaining exceptions.  In the meantime, please 
carefully review each item and commence doing whatever needs to be done to be 
in a position to finalize our response by October 26, Thursday of next week.  
I think some of the fixes will be fairly easy, but others will be more 
problematic.  Please provide this memo and a copy of the letter to anyone who 
should be aware or involved.
