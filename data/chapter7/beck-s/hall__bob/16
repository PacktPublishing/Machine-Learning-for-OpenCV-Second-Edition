Subject: Items Requiring Attention

Tommy-

Here are some items that we need some help from you to achieve:

   It has always been my understanding that there would be a complete
   separate instance of all required tables to run HPL's business and as a
   result we would be able to run all required Enron software to maintain
   our business independent of Enron.  We have just been told that we will
   not have access to the customer tables to add new customers and that
   this must be accomplished through Enron.  If this is true, it is not
   acceptable.  Could we please discuss?
[Yanowski, Tommy J.]  In our original proposal, when we offered up a long 
term service deal the fee structure covered us setting up a totally seperate 
environment for HPL/AEP.  It would take somewhere between $3 - $5 MM in 
hardware to duplicate our environment for HPL.  You guys came back and said 
you just wanted something for an interim time period at a lower cost.  It was 
then that we offered letting you use our applications running on our boxes 
and on the same database.  Most of our applications have enough application 
and database level security that we can keep Enron's data seperate from 
HPL/AEP's.  There are two applications, ERMS & CPR where we felt it necessary 
to create a duplicate environment due to security concerns.  Remember 
security cuts both ways and we don't want you looking at Enron's data just as 
much as you don't want Enron looking at yours.  Never the less the hardware 
to run these two applications plus setting up the terminal server environment 
plus the resource time is costing us about $500 K.  Hence the charge for set 
up costs.  There are three areas where Enron and AEP will be sharing data.  
They are in the global reference data area:

Global Common Codes:  Your codes for MMBtu and US Dollars will be the same as 
ours.

Global Facilities:  Your access to Pipeline, meter numbers and DRN Numbers 
will be the same as ours.  All of this information is public knowledge and is 
provided to us via IHS Energy who is the GISB certified provider of this 
information to the industry.  You will have the ability to update you own 
meter information.

Global Counterparties:  You will be sharing customer names and addresses such 
as those for settlements or statements with Enron.  We can identify within 
the Counterparty system who uses which address.  In that way we can filter 
the view to the business units so that they only see those customers that 
they deal with.  The process for HPL/AEP is the same that is used across 
Enron.  Our retail business units only see their customers and ENA only see 
theirs.  The reason we only have one group updating this information is 
because if EES starts doing business with someone who is already a customer 
of ENA then we wouldn't want to duplicate that customer information.  It 
helps us roll up total credit exposure across Enron for a customer.  The 
people who update this information are seperate from the rest of the business 
units and are instructed not to share any customer information even though 
most of it is public knowledge if you look up that customer on the internet.  
Let me know in detail what your concern is.  The ENA trading community will 
not know who your customers are and vice versa.  They will not know what 
addresses you use and vice versa.  There are only a few people across Enron 
who can find out this information and they are Enron Net Works employees who 
provide this service to all of Enron as well as the 3rd Party customers we 
are providing IT services for.  You will have a web interface to view your 
own customer information and to request updates or additions.

   It looks like we will need access to DCAF in order to send out
   confirmations for physical contracts executed on behalf of HPL.  Do you
   foresee any problems with this?
[Yanowski, Tommy J.]  We can provide confirms for those spot and 30 day deals 
that hit Sitara and DCAF II.  All this is set up and is ready to go.  Long 
Term and financial deals for Enron also flow into TAGG and into ERMS.  It is 
from TAGG that Long Term and Financial confirmations are generated via DCAF 
I.  I had been told that you will not be using ERMS for Forward Risk and 
would be confirming deals out of ZAINET so we did not set up a seperate TAGG 
and DCAF I environment to go with the seperate ERMS and CPR environment 
needed for Intramonth valuation.  We need to talk about this ASAP.  I need to 
understand what if anything you will be confirming out of ZAINet.  If you 
want to change your mind this late in the game and let Enron Confirm  
everyting except for financial deals then I need to know ASAP so that we can 
begin scrambling to see if we can set this up in time.  We actually have put 
in code to block generating HPL/AEP confirms that now needs to be removed.    

Also-

I extended offers to Ken Ellerman and Greg Lind yesterday with a start date
to be mutually determined and worked out between you and me.
[Yanowski, Tommy J.]  Thanks for letting me know.  Have you communicated 
anything to Dave Stadnick.  I probably need to talk to him and let him know 
how much we need him but it would be nice for me to know what he is aware of 
before I meet with him.


Kindest Regards,
Don
