Per our conversation -  on this past Tuesday, a group met from VM, Gas Acct=
g. and East Risk to discuss the recording of the 12 east desks and 7 centra=
l desks to SAP. Effective with March flow, each desks for Central and East =
will record to its own profit center in SAP (the wellhead desks and Texas w=
ere done in Feb.'s g/l).  According to Gas Acct., they will calculate UA fo=
r each of the profit centers (19 in total).  As we discussed, VM does not h=
ave the appropriate Unify reports or manpower to  support this level of acc=
ounting at this time and for this month will continue to tie UA4 out as we =
have in the past using our same reports - Gas Acct. will have to sum their =
side of the UA4 calc. to match us.  With the foresight of eventually going =
to profit center level accouting and reporting, there will need to be signi=
ficant changes to our current back end systems and processes to handle this=
 lower level of reporting.  I believe the flash is already being done at th=
e different profit centers, but all the downstream groups are still perform=
ing their analysis at a more consolidated level.  There were discussions in=
 the meeting that OA would not go to this lower level, but I am of the opin=
ion that we all need to be consistent in our analysis and reporting across =
the organization - so if this is the path we take, then everyone's process =
will need to be able to handle this level of detail.  Of course, no decisio=
ns were made in our meeting, and as I stated, for now, VM's process will re=
main unchanged for this month.  Please let me know if you want to discuss f=
urther.  Thanks!
