Sally, 

This is my stab at a consolidated list from the last 2 weeks.  We may have to 
change the format to capture all the issues and explanations, but I wanted 
you to have this for your meeting today. Rebooks are on the second sheet in 
the workbook, but cover only the last week.






Let me know if you have questions or need additional info. I'll be working 
with the business analyst to take over this reporting later this week, so 
please comment at your convenience.


Debbie
