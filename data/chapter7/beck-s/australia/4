Recap of my discussion with Heidi:

 All Confirms done and signed by Sydney
 Reconciliation and Cash Management of Futures account done by Sydney

 By the end of the month, Enpower data will be mechanically extracted to 
produce invoices
  (as opposed to manual keying of data in spreadsheets and verification by 
Sydney and Houston)
 A Settlements Clerk has been hired (starts 07/24) and will report to Heidi.  
Settlements clerk will prepare invoices.
  Invoices will be approved by Risk Book Admin. (Paul/Allan) and Heidi

 Paul and Allan will have a direct line to Heidi and a dotted line to 
myself.  Apparently there is some concern voiced by both
 of these guys regarding additional risk related opportunities elsewhere in 
the company.  I think that Paul is trying to get involved
 in the Japan activities.  Heidi indicated that neither seem happy with the 
current situation and reporting to Sue.

 Heidi and I will continue dialogs.

Sue is not a prerequisite for anything above.  Sydney has it covered!
