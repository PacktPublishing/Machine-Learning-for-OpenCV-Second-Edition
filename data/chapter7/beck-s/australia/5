Sally,

As seen from the chain of e-mails below, Sydney is looking to me for some 
process changes.   Can you offer guidance, or tell me who to go to for advice?

 Sue

After a quick discussion with my group I think Sally B. owns operations. I 
guess if Sally is OK with it - I couldn't see why we woulden't be.

Thanks, Bjorn.

A few weeks back, Sydney started executing their own Confirms, where in the 
past, it had been done in Houston by myself.   Since I have not heard of this 
from Houston, I would not be doing my job if I let this go unquestioned.  I 
assume this is a policy change?

They are also making advances towards becoming an Asian hub.   As such, there 
are a few responsibilities that I currently handle, which Sydney is looking 
to take over:
 - Houston independently reconciles the broker statements daily;   the 
Settlements Clerk could handle;
 - All settlements are approved by me in Houston;  the new Settlements Clerk 
could handle this as well, or someone 
   in Houston could signoff on payment before Treasury takes action.

I guess I'm looking for assurances that Sydney is supposed to become a hub, 
and some information on exactly how autonomous they should become.   Are they 
to be completely independent, or are there to be a minimum level of controls 
between offices?

 Sue

I guess I am as good a starting point as any. What can I do for you?

Bjorn,

Are you the person to go to for advice on changing Sydney process and 
controls?   We're trying to address the need for some changes, and I'm not 
sure who in Houston to go to for sign-off.

 Sue
