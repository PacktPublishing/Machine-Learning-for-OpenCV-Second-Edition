Subject: Update - ENA Confirmation Delivery System

We may finally have some good news for a change.  Mark Taylor with ENA Legal 
said yesterday 
that the law signed by President Clinton in June regarding electronic 
signatures should allow us to
eliminate confirmations for Enron OnLine transactions.  The law, in short, 
gives electronic signatures
the legal weight of paper signatures and goes into effect October 1, 2000.

Until we receive final approval, we will have to simply hope and pray that 
this becomes reality.  However, 
even if this becomes reality, we will continue to have Counterparties that 
will require confirmations such 
as the public utilities.

I will keep you updated.
