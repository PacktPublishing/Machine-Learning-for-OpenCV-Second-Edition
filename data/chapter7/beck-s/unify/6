Subject: UNIFY TO SAP INTERFACE---DAY 2

As on Day 1 we ran the UNIFY to SAP interface at 8:00 AM, Noon, and 3:00 PM. 
Set out below are the results of these runs.

The interfaces for Enron North America (financial for gas, weather, and pulp 
and paper) were error free.
The interfaces for ENA Global Products--Financial resulted in two invoices 
not being accepted by SAP. This was due to a SAP error that has occurred 
about three times in test. However, the SAP team cannot duplicate the error 
in order to correct. They are still trying to find the root of this problem. 
The two transactions which were not picked up by SAP were resent successfully.
The interfaces for ENA FX Financial uncovered a breakdown in the process. The 
payment program for this entity is to be processed manually by the Accounts 
Payable Dept. For July 5 and today, the AP Dept. forgot to process the 
payment program resulting in nine payments (7 US $, 1 Canadian, and 1 GBP) 
not  being paid. We were able to get all payments out today through SAP 
except the GBP payment. The GBP non-payment was discovered by a counterparty 
calling and stating that they did not received their funds. The US$ and 
Canadian non-payments were discovered when we reviewed our bank statements 
and found that the funds were not disbursed. For future interfaces, Bernard 
is to call Treasury after each interface is processed to ensure that the 
payments for this entity were received by them.
