Please read the meeting notice below.  Janet Dietrich's assistant set up this 
meeting at my request.  We want to present to the originators what IT 
Services are being provided to Bridgeline, discuss the value this can bring 
to ENA and talk about other potential deals in the works.  The thought is to 
spur additional value creation for Enron by offering services to our 
customers.  This would impact not only IT but Commercial Operations as well.  
Having them understand what value the two groups can bring to the table and 
how important it is for our groups to be in on the front end of these deals 
is important so that these potential deals are negotiated & structured 
correctly.  Please plan on attending if your schedules permit.  -  Tommy

Peggy:  Please make sure this gets on Philippe's schedule.
