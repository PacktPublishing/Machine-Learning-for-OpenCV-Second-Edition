Sally
Here are the notes from each of the four breakout teams and a draft letter 
for you to expand to send to the organization in follow-up to the offsite.  
Please have patti proof the notes before sending.  I hope your visit to 
London went well.  I will be around most of this coming week.  I received 
your call Mary and I will talk at length today.

Regards to all

Tom
