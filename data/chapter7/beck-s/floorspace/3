Tammy, 

Attached is the spreadsheet I promised with those employees who are left to be placed on the 5th floor.
I have excluded those Texas groups going to AEP and included the New Wellhead Logistics Group. 

 
If for any reason this changes after Sally Beck has the opportunity to review it, I will advise you asap.  

Also, I believe Sally may be interested in finding an office for Beth Apollo, VP close to her on the 5th floor. 

Please call if you have any questions.  

Thanks!
