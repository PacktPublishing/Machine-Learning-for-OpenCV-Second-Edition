Barry forwarded your note to me regarding the Forum and suggested that I 
should attend as I am Controller of EBS Europe in London - if you could 
include me on the mailing list regarding this event I would be most grateful

Save the date!  October 22-24  has been reserved for the Enron-wide 
Operations Controller Forum to be held in Houston at the Warwick Hotel.  To 
accommodate the desired travel schedule of our attendees outside the Houston 
office, the forum will kick-off the evening of Sunday, October 22.  We will 
have a full day and evening on Monday, October 23, and the forum will 
conclude mid-afternoon on Tuesday, October 24.

Many key Enron players will join us for portions of the forum.  Speakers 
confirmed to date are Jeff Skilling, Rick Causey, Ted Murphy and Bill 
Bradford.

Details will follow in the next few days.  All hotel accommodations will be 
arranged by Patti and charges for these will be absorbed by my cost center.  
Please make your own airline reservations.

I look forward to seeing you at the forum.  This will be a unique opportunity 
to get know your counterparts from the wholesale, retail, and broadband 
segments of Enron, with contingents from the U.S., Canada, England, 
Australia, and Japan.

Sally
