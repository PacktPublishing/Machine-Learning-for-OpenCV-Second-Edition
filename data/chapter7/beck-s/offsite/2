Sally,

I wanted to thank you for the opportunity to organize your Global Operations 
Forum.  I enjoyed working with you and Patti and meeting the other 
individuals that keep this organization innovated.  I hope you will keep me 
in mind should you need assistance with a similar function in the future.  
Best of luck with your continued success.

Sincerely,

Julissa Marron
