David,

The business model you outline is actually the one we are implementing with 
one big difference - the Head Trader in London (Sam Hainsworth) calls the 
sales person each day to tell him what to do before they speak to any 
customers. As you point out, these conversations are recorded so if the sales 
person does anything other than what is agreed at the outset of each day, 
then they will be red carded.

I refer you back to the memo supplementing the updated list of authorised 
traders that I sent out and which Marcelo and Sam have discussed with 
Commercial staff in both these offices (Shona and Bjorn have this memo), as 
well as Marcelo's operational plan.

Clarification point - when Andy says "internally" he means that Commercial 
(Rob Soeldner) is taking a lead in resolving Joe Robertson's concerns.

Regards,
Tim

How about this for a business model for an origination and trading outfit.

salesperson talks to customer
customer agrees to trade
salesperson phones trading desk and gets price (trading desk is London or NY 
- NB: all lines are taped) 
salesperson tell customer
customers says ok
salesperson says "done" to customer and trading desk
trading desk books deal, middle and back office processes kicks in, sends out 
and chases up confirm etc
accounting process identifies value added by salesperson and gives them a 
piece of the price as a credit
no bank accounts or signing authority in sales office 
no accountants, middle office people or other similar humans in the sales 
office, just sales people
all hedging and risk taking resident in trading books in NY or London

Can we not make this work ?
DP

Bjorn

As discussed, given Joe's comments below, a note to confirm that this being 
dealt with internally. 

Rob Soeldner has made it clear to Joe that:

Enron places great importance on trading controls. These are non-negotiatable.
The suggested course of action is not an option 
We aren't seeking to close any of the Agency offices given implemetation of 
these controls.

Joe is not in yet - Rob will be discussing with him further when the US gets 
in.

Of note - Joe is on the commercial side,  Marcelo Parra who is responsible 
for the operational side is fully onboard for the operational changes made.

Regards
Andy

As a practical matter the procedures outlined are not workable. We need to 
find a way to go forward that works and can satisfy all concerned. 

Either the people in these offices can be entrusted to transact and execute 
business or we should consider closing these offices and relocating some of 
the people which I do not believe makes any sense at all.
