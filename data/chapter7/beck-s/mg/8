As discussed, given Joe's comments below, a note to confirm that this being 
dealt with internally. 

Rob Soeldner has made it clear to Joe that:

Enron places great importance on trading controls. These are non-negotiatable.
The suggested course of action is not an option 
We aren't seeking to close any of the Agency offices given implemetation of 
these controls.

Joe is not in yet - Rob will be discussing with him further when the US gets 
in.

Of note - Joe is on the commercial side,  Marcelo Parra who is responsible 
for the operational side is fully onboard for the operational changes made.

Regards
Andy

As a practical matter the procedures outlined are not workable. We need to 
find a way to go forward that works and can satisfy all concerned. 

Either the people in these offices can be entrusted to transact and execute 
business or we should consider closing these offices and relocating some of 
the people which I do not believe makes any sense at all.
