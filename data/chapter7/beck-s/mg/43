Subject: Merlin - AA Due Diligence - Final Draft Report

Please find attached a final draft copy of the due diligence report for MG.  
During the work performed AA did not identify any material issues that Enron 
would need to be concerned about prior to the voting that is to take place 
this Friday.  The final report will be presented to me by early next week.  I 
will forward to you a copy at that time.  AA has assured me that no 
additional items of a significant nature will be added to the final report 
that are not already included in the final draft document.

If you have any questions/comments on the report please do not hesitate to 
give me a call.

Thanks

Andrea
