We are uploading the contents of S:\MG to the folder labelled S MG Dump at 
the end of each day.
So to have your information included in this Livelink database simply put the 
file into S:\MG
If you have any images which you would like to put through Optical Character 
Recognition (so that one can search on the text in diagrams) please contact 
Camilla Bydal.

Enjoy!
Richard
