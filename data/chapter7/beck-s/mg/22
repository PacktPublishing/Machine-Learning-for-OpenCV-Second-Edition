I know that Tim Jones is from MG, so he will be found in the ECT Europe 
External Address Book. In order to address him, I create a reply or new 
message and then click on the Address button. Change the address book from 
ECT or Enron to the ECT External Address Book:



At this point I need to skip down to the Jones' in the list, so I just type 
jones and a Quick Search dialogue box appears. Click OK and I go to the first 
of the Jones' llisted in this address book (Allan I think). It's a reasonably 
long list, but only one exists.



He's Tim R Jones, so I click on the 'To:' button to add him to the recipient 
list for the message.



This is a good procedure to pass on to others.
