Great to see you this week and I hope you had a safe flight home.

I'd like to talk about the RIsk person 'appointment' for Tokyo.

I guess you told me about H...Perez (sorry I forget!). How do you rate him? 
What level/grade is he? Can you let know/send me his last PRC? Joe wants to 
talk about staffing next week. I'll get a feel of the level we need/want we 
can spend etc....

I guess my 'must have' criteria would be 1) Detailed EnPower experience - in 
both ops, dev'p and daily admin 2) Excellent/Superior ranking 3) Someone you 
see as a future 'star' - as this will be (in my opinion) a great opportunity 
for someone.

I certainly can think of a few names right off the bat (depending on the 
'level' Joe will allow us) - both here and Houston - Edith (Director? - maybe 
too senior), Paul D.Arcy/Rob Yeo (2 Sen Spec in London) etc....

What do you think? Let's talk.

B.
