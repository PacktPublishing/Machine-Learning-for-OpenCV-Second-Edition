In order to provide the appropriate degree of coordination and feedback, we 
will begin to have weekly conference calls regarding progress towards putting 
in place Enron Japan.  These will commence this week and run each week until 
further notice.  If you are unable to attend please send a representative.  
The call will be conducted as below:

Houston Thursday 4pm
London  Thursday 10pm
Tokyo  Friday  7am
Sydney  Friday  9am

A call in number will be provided later this week as well as a meeting room 
for those in Houston.  I have also added a summary sheet that I would ask all 
to fill out and send in the day before the meeting.  By sticking to this 
general summary form (1 page), we will be handle to keep the calls brief and 
to the point.  I would not expect the calls to last more than 1 hour.

regards,

Joe
