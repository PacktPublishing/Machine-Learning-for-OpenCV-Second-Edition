We have zeroed out the mark to market value in the spreadsheets.  Now there  
still is "new counterparty" in the spreadsheet, but there is $0 in credit 
risk for those.  John Powell in Debbie's group is working on a longer term 
solution,  but everyone is comfortable with this for now.

Thanks for looking into this and getting back to me.  Let me know the final 
resolution on this one.

We have figured out why the credit group is getting so many "New 
Counterparty" names in gas.  The spreadsheets that they are getting that 
information from are for position purposes only on pipe-optons.  The value is 
captured in TAGG and therefore if both had the correct counterparty it would 
be doublecounting credit risk.  The spreadsheet download has a specific 
download that it has to follow which includes counterparty name  (which in 
this case had to be put in as new counterparty.)  I am working with Debbie to 
figure out how we can download those positions without showing a counterparty 
at all from the spreadsheet.  It will be done as quickly as possible.

Thanks
