All -

O:ERMS is virtually out of diskspace. If you have any large files that can be 
zipped or deleted please do so.  We had to delete files last night just so we 
could save our p&l's.  We have a program which will show all files over a 
certain meg.  and which haven't been used prior to any date of your 
choosing.  If you need this please let me know.

Thanks
