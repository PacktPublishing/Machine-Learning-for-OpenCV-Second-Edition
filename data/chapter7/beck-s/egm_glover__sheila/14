Sally, Brent, Shona,
This morning we had two problems:
One related to EIs numbers and the other relates to Portland.  Clara talked 
to Susan regarging International's problem.  Susan said they should have 
caught the incorrect commodity curve load but did not.  Clara is forwarding 
an e-mail regarding Portland.

Infinity showed a $19 MM notional curve shift change in the EI-GNS-GAS-PRC 
commodity book for 9/1/00.  This change caused a (10,200) PV01 affect on the 
trader's sensitivity report.  After talking with Susan in EI, it was brought 
to our attention that the Bolivian curve was loaded incorrectly on Friday, 
due to a change in EI's curve upload process.   This change resulted in the 
Bolivian curve loading throughout 2012, when it actually goes out to 2019.  
The incomplete curve caused  infinity to get bad cash flows.  

As a result, we had to re-do PDH reports this morning.  Final reports were 
given to traders at 9:00 am.
