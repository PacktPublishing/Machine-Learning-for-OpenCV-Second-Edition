Are you aware or should you be aware of this.....

There are several issues with this,  the main one being that we get the 
biggest bang for our "gives" to IBM..  

It seems the way this is set up,  IBM will piecemeal us and get a lot of work 
without a significant "get" for Enron (ie an outsourcing or a bandwidth or 
other deal)

Are there IT and Process issues?  Is Sally involved.  Maybe they are 
self-contained and none of this is anyone's business. 

 I would like your thoughts.....

Guys, 

we need to get our arms around this one.  John, IBM India is calling on 
Sanjay's team in India re outsourcing design and operation of data centers in 
India.  I want to make sure that we add this to  IBM's "get"  list.  
Coordination with India has not been easy.  Joe and Ken are asking us to get 
a handle on this.  Rich Thomas is helping to coordinate communication with 
India. Rich is managing the overall IBM relationship.  Rich,  could you 
please get John up to speed on this opportunity.  John will be helping Brad 
and I in the IBM negotiation.  He will be managing Enron's "gives" to IBM.

Jim

Rich,

I just wanted to get synched up on IBM.
Sanjay Bhatnagar said that Joe Hirko
said that we should coordinate.  Is there
anyone else there that should be involved
in an update?  Should Jim Crowder be
updated?

Sorry I missed your conference call.

by ENE for each contract
IBM brings existing customers to D.C. in India
ENE has ability to resell IBM services and IBM to resell ENE services
ENE has ability to resell, buy co-location space in IBM data centers outside 
of India

enter into an agreement by which IBM resells, channels ENE streaming products.

IBM is to produce a rough set of figures on operations and build out by May 
18.  Three weeks later they are to produce a set of refined costs.
Master agreement is to be signed by May 22nd.

On the subject of network and fiber build, we are moving forward with the

Atul -

Rich Thomas is going to contact you early this morning to discuss progress 
with IBM.  If you have time before he calls to pull together an e-mail with a 
quick brain dump on the progress that includes any data center, network, 
fiber build, etc. discussions it would be appreciated.  Thanks.
