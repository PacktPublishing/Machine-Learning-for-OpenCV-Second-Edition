Bill,

Upon Rick's request, I have compiled a brief summary of our conversation 
yesterday. Please take a look and provide you comments - I may not have 
presented all the facts and company names accurately. Also, please see 
attached the latest Enron Corp. Risk Management Policy and the Transaction 
Approval Guidelines.



Thanks, Vlady. (x36954)
