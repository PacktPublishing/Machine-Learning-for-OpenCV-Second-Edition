Hi there -

Hope you are well, and enjoyed the weekend.  It was much too short for us!!  

I was wondering what the next steps are in terms of formalizing the role that 
you and I discussed in San Antonio.

As Fernley gets closer and closer to nailing my replacement, I am feeling 
more and more exposed.

As much as Rick and others have told me not to worry, it would be nice to 
nail it down.

I really do think that I would benefit greatly from more of a middle office 
focus, and have the management skills to supervise a large team of people.  I 
know I would bring a new perspective to the role, coming from more of a back 
office focus, and after my European experience know how to focus on key 
controls.



Do I need to do anything?    I have discussed February departure timing with 
Fernley and he is fine with it.  Depending upon my replacement, it could be 
sooner.

I would need a few weeks to get things wrapped up in London like moving and 
packing etc.  and re-established in Houston  -- need to buy cars etc.

but otherwise there shouldn't be too much downtime between places.

Glad to discuss at any time  x830 6639

Keep me posted

Beth
