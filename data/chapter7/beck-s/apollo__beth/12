Here's a summary of our meeting this morning.  As we begin to lay the=20
groundwork for this project, I think it's important to summarize our though=
ts=20
and activities in writing.  If any of you have comments or corrections,=20
please feel free.

Objective
Enron is sizing up the opportunity to offer internal back office processing=
=20
services to external clients. Objective of this meeting was to understand t=
he=20
spreadsheet meant to estimate the potential P&L for this offering.
Overview
Looked at spreadsheet for validation:
? Need to better determine the actual market for this service.
? Need to better understand the current revenue and expense projections and=
=20
assumptions, expanding on them to include customers not currently with Enro=
n.
Ongoing:
Defining the size of the market:
? There may be three =01+levels=01, of markets for these services - one for=
 energy=20
risk mgt. ops (attack first), a larger market if we include global market=
=20
offerings, and yet a larger market if we think of our offering as transacti=
on=20
processing, ala ADP.
? There are a number of ways to derive the potential market size.  The=20
current spreadsheet identifies existing customers.  Some may be seeking our=
=20
services based on their current and projected deal volumes. =20
? Fred will continue to analyze the market size(s), adding customers outsid=
e=20
of current EOL spectrum.
? Fred will analyze the offerings and pricing structures used by competitor=
s.=20
? Sheri will get with internal data owners to (in)validate current=20
spreadsheet numbers and identify customers with high year-over-year increas=
es=20
in EOL transaction volume.

Expenses
? James will take a harder look at the expenses.  We wonder if number of=20
transactions is the best method to use.  What is the real cost driver?  Whe=
re=20
are the =01+breaking points=01,, or transaction levels where we must invest=
 further=20
to offer services to additional customers?

Strategy
? Beth Apollo will schedule a meeting with Beth Perlman, Jenny Rub, Rahil, =
et=20
al to discuss ongoing big picture.
? Beth will also schedule a meeting with Mark Taylor, to include Rahil and=
=20
Dale.  They will discuss points on the service level agreement that we will=
=20
use with our external customers.
