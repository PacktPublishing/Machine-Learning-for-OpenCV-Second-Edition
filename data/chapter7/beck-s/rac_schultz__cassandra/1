Please excuse the long e-mail below - I knew we'd never get a chance to all=
 get together, and this is somewhat urgent as I have to complete the Financ=
e Committee presentation for the upcoming BOD meeting by the end of next we=
ek, and it will include trading results for the 1st quarter, reported in ac=
cordance with the risk management policy.  Due to issues noted below, this =
may require immediate attention by your staff as we have a few short days t=
o come up with the best quality numbers we can.  I talked to Beth already, =
and MRM met with Chris Abel's group to see if there was a short cut, but ou=
r joint conclusion was that the business unit controllers need to be involv=
ed in this process as you are the experts on your businesses and can apply =
the best judgment to decide on the trading results to be reported to the BO=
D.  We'll probably need to go with our best estimate of 3/30 #s as of end o=
f the day next Tuesday or Wednesday at the latest.

As you recall, the February 12th BOD meeting resulted in a clarification th=
at the BOD approved trading limits were limits on the generic commodity gro=
ups defined, and accordingly the trading results must be reported consisten=
t with that limit structure (management reporting can be different of cours=
e).  Chris Abel's global energy operations group has prepared a "RAC" DPR t=
hat attempts to aggregate the commodity groups in accordance with the risk =
management policy, so that top management and the BOD can see Enron's expos=
ure to individual commodities on a consolidated basis.    (A)  This DPR wil=
l not impact actual sharing of P/L from a management reporting/business uni=
t perspective - this is purely for market risk management purposes and repo=
rting to the BOD.  But commercial management will need to review and sign o=
ff on the RAC DPR and monitor limits accordingly, as these limits are at an=
 Enron level.

The specific trading results we need for the BOD presentation are the first=
 quarter P/L and average daily VaR, by commodity group.  The first RAC DPR =
available is as of 3/30 - so while it has cumulative P/L, VaR is only as of=
  3/30.  (Note - we're also comparing to 1Q 2000, but we're not going to at=
tempt to resolve cross-commodity reporting for that period except at a high=
 level).

Your participation is needed in resolving: 1) cross-commodity reporting per=
 the new RAC DPR - both retroactively for the 1st quarter, and going forwar=
d, and 2) ROVAR (return on average daily VaR by commodity group) for the 1s=
t quarter.  This aggregation of cross-commodity activity has been completed=
 by Chris as of 3/30, so he has what he believes to be P/L aggregated for t=
he quarter in accordance with the policy. What we don't have is VaR on a da=
ily basis as the first time it was calculated on an aggregated basis was on=
 3/30.  Obviously we're not going to be able to go back and calculate daily=
 VaR for the entire quarter by commodity group aggregated in this new manne=
r - especially within a week.  So it appears we'll need to "swag" average d=
aily VaR - by reviewing the cross commodity positions aggregated at 3/30, b=
y considering cross-commodity activity you're aware of that took place thro=
ughout the quarter, and using our best estimate of the impact on VaR for th=
is cross commodity activity. =20

Due to this adjustment in historical reporting practices, we feel a certain=
 level of due diligence is required for us to  feel confident we're reporti=
ng to the BOD in accordance with the policy. And since we only have a few d=
ays, I thought a team approach to tackling the review would facilitate a pr=
ompt resolution of material issues, and then you and Chris' group can work =
out your processes and procedures on how to handle going forward as you see=
 fit.  When you consider materiality, please involve your Market Risk conta=
ct - while a transaction/position/book may not be material to gas or power,=
 it may be material to Global Products,  Weather, etc..

Would you please help us with the following:
?=09Confirm your review of Chris' aggregation on the RAC DPR at 3/30 (Chris=
' staff can walk you through)
?=09are all the cross-commodity positions you're aware of being reported co=
rrectly?
?=09is there other cross-commodity activity not present at 3/30 and consequ=
ently not aggregated for the quarter's results, but actually present during=
 the first quarter and material? If so, estimate impact on P/L and average =
daily VaR.
?=09we're not expecting an exhaustive search or analysis - perhaps you can =
simply discuss this issue with the traders who handle this type of activity=
 to get a feel, and if they point on specific material transactions, we can=
 address those; you can determine best approach
?=09are there certain books in RisktRAC that have cross-commodity positions=
 imbedded/combined - either held currently or those that generated signific=
ant VaR or P/L during the quarter?  Going forward these will need to be rep=
orted separately to facilitate risk reporting, but in the next week what we=
 need is an estimate of the impact on the corresponding commodities, or a c=
onclusion that the impact is immaterial.
?=09Once you've reviewed the summary of cross commodity activity per the RA=
C DPR and per your own knowledge, help us estimate the impact on the respec=
tive commodities' average daily VaR for the quarter - you can discuss with =
your market risk contact your recommendation on a reasonable "swag" approac=
h.


After considering the information above, please provide your assessment on =
whether you are in fact able to capture and report all the cross-commodity =
activity, and if not, identify the issues involved and whether it is someth=
ing that market risk needs to address, or if it will simply take more time =
to resolve the reporting details.

If you have other recommendations on how to get comfortable with the tradin=
g results for the quarter, please feel free to pursue those.  I do not mean=
 to imply I know how to do your jobs, or that you're not doing them - I sim=
ply want to coordinate with you to ensure the #s we report to the BOD are t=
he numbers you agree with, and that if they're not completely accurate give=
n recent implementation, that we are able to articulate and estimate the po=
tential misstatement, if any.  As you are the experts on your businesses' r=
esults, I simply wanted to make sure I closed the loop with what we in MRM =
understand regarding your reporting of the cross-commodity activity and tra=
ding results and the application of the policy.

On a separate note, we need you to identify P/L related to special transact=
ions that flowed through the DPR, but do not really represent trading activ=
ity - examples in the past are SFAS 125 transactions and other unique gain/=
loss events - we're reporting 1Q 2001 and 1Q 2000, so whatever we can recal=
l about last year will also be considered. We will be sending you a reconci=
liation from the DPR to the BOD package that we use to document any special=
 adjustments, and will discuss this with you to come to an agreement on adj=
ustments to the DPR reporting to derive true trading activity. These adjust=
ments should be minimal, but we'd like your input to conclude. =20


Thank you for your cooperation,

(A)  For example, North American Electricity limits represent Enron's conso=
lidated NA Electricity trading activity, without regard to which business u=
nit or commodity group actually executes the trades or holds positions. So =
if Power has some gas positions for hedges or other reasons, these gas trad=
es need to be removed from Power VaR and P/L and combined with Gas' VaR and=
 P/L, etc..  Heating oil positions held outside Global Products should be a=
ggregated with Global Products; Global Products' positions in gas and power=
 should be aggregated with gas and power, with corresponding adjustment to =
Global Products' results.
