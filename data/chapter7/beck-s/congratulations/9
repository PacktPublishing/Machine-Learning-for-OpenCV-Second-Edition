First of all congratulations on your promotion, it is well deserved.  You are 
really in some rarefied air, since there seem to be very few Managing 
Directors.

I also would like to compliment you on putting together one of the best  2 
1/2  hour seminars / workshops that I have ever attended ( I know that is 
saying a mouthful).  The Operational Risk Meeting / Workshop was not only 
informative, but the constantly changing formats kept everyone's attention.   
I believe the meeting also caused a renewed enthusiasm among your supervisory 
personnel.  This is not only my observation, but the feeling of all of the 
people that I have talked to over the past few weeks. 

Once again, congrats.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
