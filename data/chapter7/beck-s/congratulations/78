Rick, thanks for doing this. We have been working on this for two years and 
needed some impetus from Corp. Zahid Dohadwala is our Internal Audit Manager 
by title and most of his activities over the past two years, outside of 
coordinating endless JV partner queries, has been documenting business 
processes and implementing, through team discussions, better practices and 
controls. 
We look forward to working with Sally.
Rick Phillips
