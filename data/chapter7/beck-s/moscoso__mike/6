Mike,

The Global Products team met yesterday to discussing current staffing 
issues.  We are going to be short London risk people with some of the current 
changes that are taking place within the Global Products groups and really 
wouldn't be able to consider someone until later this year maybe late Q4.

Please let me know if I can be of further assistance.

Mike,

Scott Earnest, Tani Nath, Tim Poullain-Patterson, and myself are having a 
discussion around staffing tomorrow, and will discuss your proposal as a part 
of that.

I will let you know our thoughts post that meeting.

Kevin
