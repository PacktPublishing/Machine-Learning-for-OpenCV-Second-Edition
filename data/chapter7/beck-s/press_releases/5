HOUSTON - Enron Corp. hosted its annual equity analyst conference today in=
=20
Houston.  Ken Lay, Enron chairman and chief executive officer, opened the=
=20
conference by highlighting Enron=01,s tremendous growth across all business=
es=20
and the outstanding 700 percent return to shareholders over the past decade=
.
Enron presented key objectives for 2000:
? Continued strong growth in the core Wholesale Energy businesses.
? Break-out performance from Retail Energy Services.
? Rapid development of Enron Broadband Services.

Enron=01,s ability to extend core skills and competencies to new markets wa=
s a=20
recurring theme throughout the day.

Wholesale Energy Business
Growth prospects remain strong for Wholesale Energy Operations and Services=
,=20
Enron=01,s largest business.  Wholesale energy growth in North America is=
=20
expected to be driven by the continuing deregulation of power markets in th=
e=20
United States and large-scale energy outsourcing by utilities and large=20
energy consumers.  Enron expects to continue to broaden its early lead acro=
ss=20
the European continent as markets quickly open to competition.  Finally,=20
Enron is rapidly expanding its wholesale presence in other markets such as=
=20
Japan, where large customers will be permitted to choose their electricity=
=20
provider in March 2000.
EnronOnline will provide additional wholesale growth as incremental sales a=
re=20
generated through this innovative, Internet-based transaction system.  Over=
=20
450 customers around the world have used EnronOnline and over 10,000=20
transactions have been completed since its introduction in late November=20
1999.  Yesterday, EnronOnline transaction levels reached a new record with=
=20
over 700 transactions, representing a notional value of $250 million. =20
Transaction processing costs with EnronOnline are significantly lower than=
=20
costs associated with traditional transaction methods.
Enron=01,s Gas Pipeline Group is also well positioned to continue growing, =
with=20
expansions planned or underway on several of its systems.

Retail Energy Services
With over 16,500 facilities under management, the infrastructure is in plac=
e=20
to service customers worldwide.  As the strong contracting momentum=20
continues, Enron Energy Services is poised to rapidly increase earnings in=
=20
2000.  Enron Energy Services=01, goal for 2000 is to sign new contracts=20
representing $16 billion in future expenditures by customers for energy and=
=20
energy services, nearly double the level in 1999.

Enron Broadband Services
The new name of Enron=01,s communications business, Enron Broadband Service=
s,=20
reflects its role in the very fast growing market for premium broadband=20
services.  Enron is deploying an open, flexible global broadband network=20
controlled by software intelligence, which precludes the need to invest in =
a=20
traditional point-to-point fiber network.  This Enron Intelligent Network i=
s=20
widely interconnected to both other wholesale bandwidth carriers and to=20
Internet service providers, thus providing the platform for two new Enron=
=20
business centers, bandwidth intermediation and broadband content delivery.
A direct transfer of Enron=01,s core market making and risk management skil=
ls=20
from its energy businesses, bandwidth intermediation will provide=20
capacity-holders a vast array of alternatives for flexible, low cost=20
capacity.  Enron will also provide premium broadband content services, such=
=20
as high-quality video-streaming and large broadband file transfer, with=20
differentiated levels of quality in a usage-based business model.
As announced in a separate release, Enron also reached an agreement with Su=
n=20
Microsystems that provides for accelerated development of broadband Interne=
t=20
services.
Enron is one of the world=01,s leading electricity, natural gas and=20
communications companies.  The company, which owns approximately $34 billio=
n=20
in energy and communications assets, produces electricity and natural gas,=
=20
develops, constructs and operates energy facilities worldwide, delivers=20
physical commodities and financial and risk management services to customer=
s=20
around the world, and is developing an intelligent network platform to=20
facilitate online business.  Enron=01,s Internet address is www.enron.com, =
and=20
the stock is traded under the ticker symbol, =01&ENE.=018
