Since this was a fix to a Doorstep finding, how do we react?

Lavarato has stopped efforts for implementing Enpower in South America until 
business activity increases enough to support it.

Based on below, we will start looking for someone with strong Access/Excel 
knowledge to come up with a different solution.  Everyone will have to 
regroup and determine next steps and look at revised timelines.

I discussed this with John Lavorato who is now responsible for this.  He said 
don't do anything!  When their  volumes increase we can address the Enpower 
implementation again.

Subject: EnPower production - Argentina Power

Richard / Beth,  We have been asked by risk to get Argentina started on 
EnPower.  Are you OK with us moving on this?  A couple things to consider...

Our instance strategy for EnPower is determined by geographic location 
(bandwidth), volumes, and market similarity (functionality).  Based on this, 
I want to set South America up on their own instance.  EnPower will have the 
following instances long term:  EUR, US, CND, SA, AUS, JPN, IND.  We will 
continue to pursue a common code base and logical data model.

There is additional time and cost associated with setting up a new instance, 
however, I am concerned about continuing to pile new business units into a 
production environment that will eventually need to be split.

Glad to discuss...  Please respond quickly, as we are waiting to pull the 
trigger on this...

Steve

Duong,
Per our phone conversation, below is the list of people that would need 
access to EnPower production. 

User Names:   NT ID:  Extension:
Scott Mills   SMills  x3-3548
Martha Stevens  MSteven x3-4742
Sarah Smith   SSmith  x3-0997
Juana Fayette  JFayett  x3-0992
Jana Morse  JMorse  x6-8265
Trang Le  TLe1  x3-6996

Currently, the Argentine Power group has in total about 20 physical forward 
deals  which will be done under Enron Comercializadora De Energia Argentina 
S.A.(Co. 027W) and one financial deal which will be done under Enron North 
America (Co. 0364). Given the fact that we'll also have deals on ENA, I would 
think that we could be on the Houston server. Just let us know.  
In the mean time, we'll be working with the various Global groups to have the 
proper desk, portfolio, facilities etc.... set up.

Thanks for your help,
Trang x3-6996
