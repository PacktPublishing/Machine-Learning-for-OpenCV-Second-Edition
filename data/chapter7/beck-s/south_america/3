Things are now firmed up:

I will be in Argentina 04/10 - 04/14 and Brazil 04/17 - 04/18.  Hopefully we 
will get some great discussions going.  Martha will be managing day to day in 
my absence.  Sue is still working with Sydney.  Speaking of that side of the 
world -I heard that things are not working as planned.  Any news of what 
might happen?
