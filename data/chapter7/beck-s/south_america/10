Greetings.

Attached is the Argentine gas process flow, which has been under review for 
the past month or so by Mike Guerriero, his staff in BA and my group in 
Houston.   The Southern Cone trading support is based off of this model, so 
it also applies to power in BA and SP.   I do have process flows for power in 
both places, but I would like to revisit them prior to distribution.   If you 
would like them regardless, just let me know and I will pass them along asap.

I hope you have a successful trip.   Please let me know how I can be of 
help.   I am curious to hear your findings.
