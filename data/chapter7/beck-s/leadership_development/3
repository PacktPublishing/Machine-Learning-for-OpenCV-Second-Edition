Subject: Leadership Development Pilot

Good News regarding the ENA Leadership Curriculum!  Through the help of a 
Vendor Selection Team from EOPS, we've chosen Southwest Performance Group and 
Wilson Learning products as one of our primary vendors for the Leadership 
Curriculum and programs.  We are ready to conduct a pilot on February 8-10 of 
six modules.  The purpose of the pilot is to evaluate for fine-tuning the  
Wilson Learning materials and facilitators and to present just a portion of 
the Leadership curriculum.  

In order to evaluate the materials thoroughly, it would be great to get a 
cross-section of ENA to attend.  We are asking that you invite several 
supervisors from your client groups to participate in any of the courses 
listed below.  The sessions will be held in room 560 and times are listed 
below.  Also attached is a description of the modules.  All are designed for 
supervisors only, with the exception being "Communicating Effectively".  This 
is open to any employee.  As a benefit in attending the pilot, I will pick up 
the cost., so there will be no charge back for their attendance.  

We are currently completing the curriculum design and will have information 
on the full curriculum available in February.  This will include options 
other than "classrom setting" for development.

Please respond back to Gracie Presas by February 1 with your names.  If you 
have further questions, please contact me at 3-7394.  We are really excited 
that we have this available and hope that your clients will find it to be 
valuable.

The following are half-day sessions.  Supervisors may sign up for any or all 
depending on their need.  It would be helpful if supervisors attend a minimum 
of two modules.  

Date   Module     Time    Target Audience

Feb. 8   Meeting Leadership Challenges   8-12 am    Supervisors with less 
than 6 months experience

   Working Styles     1-5 pm    Any supervisor
