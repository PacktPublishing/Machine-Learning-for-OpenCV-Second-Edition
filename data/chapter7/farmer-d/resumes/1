I sent you a stack of Risk candidate resumes inter - office Monday.  (Steve, 
Dutch also received them - spoke with him directly).     These candidates 
have not been contacted.  Please let me know who looks good for your 
positions to help prioritize the ones we should phone screen. 

I also have a stack of Out of Town resumes that would probably need 
relocation. Let me know if you want to see them. 

Thanks
Toni
