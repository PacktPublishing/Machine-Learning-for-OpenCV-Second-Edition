Hello Jerry,

I would like to refer a friend of mine that is really interested in joining 
Enron to the Sr. Specialist Position in your group. He has an MBA degree from 
Mexico's leading business school and extensive trading and risk management 
experience. I'm enclosing his resume for your reference, and feel free to 
contact me or him directly.

Thanks for your attention,



Catherine Simoes
