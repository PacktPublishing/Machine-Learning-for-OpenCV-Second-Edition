Charlie,

Here is a breakout for the volumes that have been paid on. We are off by 
approximately 20000 according to what was billed vs what was paid. Could you 
peruse the worksheet for discrepancies.  We are off by 20,000 in March 
(28th). Our logs show that 20000 flowed on that day at LS (Meter 67). I've 
attached the email showing the revision for that day below.  Based on paid 
amounts, the remaining obligations are as follows:
 IFERC 2,680,000
 IFERC + Gas Daily 6,895,252
Please advise.

Regards,
Ami
