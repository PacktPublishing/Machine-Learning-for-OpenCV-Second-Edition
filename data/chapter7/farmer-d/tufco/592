Ami and Daren,,,,
Just wanted again to say Thanks!!!, for the great time at St. Pete's Beach, 
Fla.
The company, food, fishing and yes, of coarse
the drink or many drinks were great!!! Daren, can relate to the drinks.
I enjoyed meeting everyone there.
We appreciate your business and look forward to continue our business relation
with Enron in the future.

Sincerely,
Tim
