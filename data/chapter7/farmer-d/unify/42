Please see note from Nommensen below and let me know your thoughts (note:  
this additional functionality/screen 
view may cause an impact on system performance).

THanks!

Donna,

A request was brought up this week that I would like you to run by the 
managers for input:
 - add the deal price to the Sales and Supply list windows of Path Manager
This seems more significant based on the transactions from EOL.

This has been mentioned in the past, but has had some related "baggage":
 - impact on performance, may run slower.  Could make it an option so you pay 
the price when you need it.
 - ability to show tier info.  Maybe just use the work "Tiered" and not try 
to represent the actual pricing
 - agreed format for those deals that have index pricing and percentage and 
fixed price offset (ie 98% of IF.Transco.ZN1 + .02)

This column would be customizable by resizing and relocating it by user 
preference.

Let me know what you hear.  d.n.
