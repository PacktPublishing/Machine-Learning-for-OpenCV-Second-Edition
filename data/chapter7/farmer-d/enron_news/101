I spoke to Mr. Maldinado this morning and it doesn't look good.  He claims he 
has a connection to the Minister of "Energy" who will allocate gas to him.  I 
asked where would the gas be delivered, and he said anywhere you want it.  
Short term or long term?  Again, anything you want, but probably long term is 
better.

I pointed out that there isn't an Energy Minister in Saudi and would he know 
the name of the Minister whose giving him the gas?  He stumbled and couldn't 
remember the name.

Finally he said "What do you have to lose?  Just send me a letter requesting 
gas with the specs, location and duration" and he'll do his best to get it.  

If you want to try it Rob, he's all yours.  His fax number is 562/866-7368, 
address 16276 Grand Avenue, Bellflower, CA 90706.

Regards,

Samir

Rob, 

I got your name from Doug Leach.  He  thought that you would be the person to 
talk to about this.

I got a call last night from Rudolph Maldonado.  (The operator forwarded him 
our way.)  He stated that he has some natural gas to sell in Saudi Arabia.  
His number is 562-866-1755.  Could you give him a call and check this out?  I 
told him that I would find someone that he could discuss this with.

I can be reached at 3-6905 if you have any questions.
