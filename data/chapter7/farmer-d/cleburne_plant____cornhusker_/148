FYI----

I checked with Ken Reisz with Tenaska IV this afternoon re: maintenance being 
completed, and at this point they are still on track to come back up on the 
9th sometime......however, he did say that they have not gotten a look at 
everything just yet, but expect to have a better idea as to their downtime in 
the morning.  He said he would call Mary with the latest news.  Mary, please 
check with him on Thursday to see where they are at, at if we need to nom gas 
to Lonestar or not.

Thanks,
Mark
