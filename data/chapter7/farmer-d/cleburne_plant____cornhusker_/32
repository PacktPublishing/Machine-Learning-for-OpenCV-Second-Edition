Section 6.4 of Tenaska IV's gas transportation agreement with Lone Star requires the shipper to pay transporter $1,040,000 in transportation fees and/or deficienty payments from the initial delivery date through December 31, 2003.  Do we know what the payments to Lone Star have been to date?  If not, can we find out by contacting Lone Star?
