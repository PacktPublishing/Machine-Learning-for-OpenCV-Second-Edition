I am having trouble with the transport deal for the Tenaska IV contracts on 
Lone Star.  We have deal 452491 in Sitara for meter 20014804 at a $0.01 
transport rate.  We received the statement from TXU Lone Star and it does not 
agree with our deal.  They are billing for meter 25000200 at $0.10 and meter 
20014903 at $0.02.  These meters relate to the Tenaska IV sale deal 384258 
and the Tenaska Marketing deal 459898, respectively.  Should our deal match 
what TXU is billing or is there another deal that I am missing?  I haven't 
worked with transport very much, so I could be confused.  I think we have 
this problem with Oct 2000, also, but I have not reviewed it yet.  I am going 
to look at it this afternoon.  Tenaska IV has already reimbursed us for the 
TXU transport, so we will need to pay this next week.  

Also, now that we have the actuals for Nov 2000, we need to update the demand 
fees to reflect the correct volumes.  Barring any changes, I have listed the 
adjustments below and attached my spreadsheet.  The Unify adjustments will be 
over by about $20.00 from the spreadsheet.  I thought it would be better have 
the Cleburne desk at zero, than to leave a balance.

1. Deal 529856 - Change 11/1 demand fee from $341,250.47 to $493,365.74 
(Difference $152,115.27)
2. Deal 529856 - Change 11/2 demand fee from $167,062.50 to $159,721.55 
(Difference $7,340.95)
3. Deal 514353 - Change Agency fee volume from 45,000/day to 45,016/day 
(Difference $19.72)



Thanks,
Megan
