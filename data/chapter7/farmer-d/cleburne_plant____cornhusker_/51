Megan/James--

Here is a revised copy of the Tenaska business for April (per Megan's Eagle Eye).....sorry for the inconvenience.  

 

And don't forget to back out  20.000 less fuel to get the total delivered on the transports.......the 20.000 comes from
the last 4 days of the month at meter17-4335-00 and is payback by Williams....it is not figured in, because there noms are kept whole in this
worksheet.

Thanks,
Mark
