I took a look at the transport for TXU Lone Star for Tenaska IV for 10/00.  
We mostly have price differences, but one deal needs some days added.  Let me 
know if you need copies of the invoices.  The meters below are delivery 
meters.  I wasn't sure what the receipt meters would be.

Deal 452491, Meter 20014903  Need to add days 24-26 and 28-31 
     Need to check rate - We show $0.01 and we were billed $0.02

Deal 452491, Meter 25000200  Need to check rate - We show $0.02 and we were 
billed $0.10

Deal 452475, Meter 25000200  Need to check rate - We show prices from $0.005 
to $0.02
      and we were billed $0.11

Thanks,
Megan
