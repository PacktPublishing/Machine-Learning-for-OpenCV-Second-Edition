We need to change the demand fees for Tenaska IV based on actuals for Jan 
2001.   Tenaska owes us some additional money.  I have attached my netting 
spreadsheet if you need it.

Deal 514353  Change MMBtu from 45,000 to 46,113
Deal 384258  Change amount from $3,934,644.50 to $3,841,888.11



I got your message regarding Apache.  I will just leave the pay the lesser 
ofs there until they come back for it.   Also, Mark checked with TXU and we 
do not have the rights to get dailies for the Tenaska meters.  He said that 
only the interconnecting pipes get dailies.  For the spreadsheet, I am just 
going to prorate the actuals based on the noms.  

I will let you know when we receive the payment from Brazos for Feb 2001, so 
you can enter the demand fee to forward the cash to Tenaska IV.

Thanks,
Megan
