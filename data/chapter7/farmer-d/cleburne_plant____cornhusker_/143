Daren,

We are working with Mark McCoy on getting some things repathed in the 
system.  It appears that we have not been actualizing the receipts in Unify 
just the deliveries -not sure why????.  We have been paying the suppliers 
based on whatever they invoice us for, which typically has been a smaller 
number than what we have in Unify.  Also, we have not been able to get a 
contact for the allocation statement.  In some cases, we get the summary 
sheet, but no detail and some months we don't get anything at all.  Do you 
know of a good contact that we can call so that we receive the allocation on 
a timely and consistent basis?  The contacts on the allocation statements 
that we do have are not returning phone calls.  I also need to know what was 
the beginning balance when we took this on for Tenaska?   Anything else that 
we need from you, I will call you.

Thanks,
RW

Rita, 

Since I was out of the office most of the week, I missed reading this 
e-mail.  I am open any afternoon this week except for Friday (all day) and 
Bob's staff meeting tomorrow (if we have it).  Let me know when you want to 
meet.
