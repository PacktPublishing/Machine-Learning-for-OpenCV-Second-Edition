I know you're busy with bid week, so here are a couple questions & comments 
for you:

September
I need to know if a ticket has been set up for September for the market side 
of the Williams & Apache gas.  We still only the supply is in MOPS.  If it 
just needs points added to it, just let me know the deal ticket #.

August 31st
This was the day we scheduled the payback to our two transport contracts on 
Lonestar  1023 & 1460.  Currently, they do not have the supply points needed 
for the Williams & Apache gas in order for the gas to be pathed to 
imbalance...so I will get them added so this gas can be pathed.  

July 31 - Aug 7
These days were pathed as buy/sells from Tenaska IV to Tenaska Marketing 
Ventures.

I worked with volume management to get these out in time for payment (July & 
Aug business), and had them do a manual entry for Aug 31st.


Please let me know what you think when you get a chance.


Thanks,
Mark
