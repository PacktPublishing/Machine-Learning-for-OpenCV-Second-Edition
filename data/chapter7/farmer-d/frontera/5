Subject:	TECO Trading Conf. Call - 3:30 Monday

Please attend a short trading meeting on the TECO Deal at 3:30pm on Monday 4/9 (Stephanie - please get us EB3143c starting at 3:30pm, I already have it at 4pm) to discuss the trading aspects of the TECO Frontera Deal.  At 4:00pm we will have a conference call with TECO to coordinate anything for scheduling Tues 4/10 for Wed 4/11.  I apologize for the short notice.

Any questions please ask, we all need to read and understand the contract thoroughly in order to meet our obligations for TECO.
.

Thanks, - Mike
