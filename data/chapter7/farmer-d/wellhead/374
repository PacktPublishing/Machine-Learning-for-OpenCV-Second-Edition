Daren,

According to Vance's response to Lauri's email, the nominations should be 
revised upwards approximately 650/d on the gathering contract(s) at this 
meter.  There is currently nominations of 1,353/d (1,153 gathering and 200 
transport).  The flow should be around 2,000/d.  Is it alright to include the 
increase of 650/d with the other revisions to be made after trading on Friday?

Bob

Lauri,

Effective 3/1/2001, HPLC amended its contract with Royal Production changing 
the price to 100% HSC less $0.16 and extending the term through 2/28/02. 
Consequently, for March, HPLC should be purhasing volumes from two wells at 
meter 5310.  Effective April, HPLC amended the same contract releasing the 
L.G. Talbert #2 lease in the committed reserves agreement; Mike Morris is the 
gas buyer and expects volumes of approximately 2000mmbtu/d.  For April I nom 
1132/d; Bob, we should probably increase the nom to reflect the incremental 
production at this point.

Thanks,

vlt

Louis Cox with Copano (the interconnecting party at this meter) informed me 
that effective March 1st, we should have been buying incremental gas from 
Royal Production at this point since they were no longer selling it to 
Copano.  There have been no changes in the producer services noms at this 
point, however.  This point appears to be on a 14 day chart and the last flow 
I have access to shows noms of 1332mm with BAV of 3497mm on March 18th.  
Bob/Vance- could one of you guys check into this and see what the nom should 
be?  Copano says they're not getting the gas in April either, but they do not 
know how long HPLC is purchasing the incremental gas from Royal.  Please let 
me know what the resolution is.  Thanks.
