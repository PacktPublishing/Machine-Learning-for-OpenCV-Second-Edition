I am not sure who should handle this, so, I shared the "wealth".  On deal 
ticket 133259, purchase from Calpine, the deal is input at meter 4229, which, 
per the email below, was terminated.  I have an unresolvable UA4 issue at 
meter 4229 for September and for October.  I have changed the meter 
designation for November forward, however, I receive an error in Sitara when 
I attempt to change either the prior or current month.  This deal should have 
been changed to meter 6835 effective back in February of this year.  Please 
let me know what I can do to resolve this issue ASAP. 

Thanks,

Mary

I just talked to the tech-Bobby Husky and he confirmed that meter 984229 has 
been removed. Now the other roos station is 986835.

Cheryl,

FYI  - Here is the message from Mary Poorman in Logistics.  

Mary,

Cheryl is going to call the field and find out if this meter should still be 
included on the termination list and also see if the field people see any gas 
flow on the meter.

Thanks,

Kathy

Kathy and I are trying to clean up an unaccounted for issue at the above 
referenced meter.  The system (Pops) does not show a BAV flow or an actual 
flow for prior months.  Kathy phoned measurement to inquire about Mips 
volumes and was informed that this meter is on a disabled status list back to 
February, 2000.  I am showing a purchase from Calpine at this meter (deal 
ticket 133259) on gathering agreement 

I would greatly appreciate your help in determining the current status of 
this meter and this deal.  Please forward any information you may have.

Thank you for your time and patience,

Mary
