One more request....

The Ken Petroleum contract:  96019316 will terminate tonight (2/29/00)!  I 
believe that also means that the deal attached to this contract will 
terminate.  It covers meter 6834.

Tom, can you put in the following one month ticket:
Counterparty   Meter   Volumes  Price   
Ken Petroleum Corporation 6834   89mmbtu  IF/HSC less $0.41 

Julie, can you confirm via a GTC Spot, per George's request. 

Thank you for handling on such short notice. 

Melissa

Melissa, please paper this deal for March with either (preferably) a spot gtc 
or a firm, one month gtc.  The firm contract has not yet been requested from 
Legal due to facility issues.
