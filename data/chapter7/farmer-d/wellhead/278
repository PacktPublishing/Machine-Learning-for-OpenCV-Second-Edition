In regards to Meter 098-4179 the following information is what I have been=

able to determine from the information available to me.

To your questions:

1. Cannot determine who owns this meter.  I will contact Molly Carriere on=

Monday when she returns.

2. HPL has a fifty (50) ft. easement at this location which does contain=20
language for appurtenance rights within the 50'.

3. I pulled the meter file for this location which was prepared during=20
Project Rock and it does not contain a  Facility Agreement so I am assuming=
=20
one was not    located.

Hope this helps.

Coastal has verbally advised that the Albrecht #4 well contains more than=

predecessor, MJG, Corp.) has treated these three wells for H2S in a manner=

sufficient to reduce the H2S content delivered into HPLC to permissible=20
levels.  Coastal has further indicated that it intends to reduce the H2S=20
