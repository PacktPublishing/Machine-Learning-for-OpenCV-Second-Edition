Mary:

Have you heard anything back from Vance Taylor on this issue?  I get the 
feeling that this is soon going to reach "critical mass".

Fred

Fred,

Could you give me the status or an ETA on this meter.  We are in the middle 
of a big push to lower our exposure and the following customer has $55,000 
not including Sept production because we've paid manually without having the 
volumes in Unify for this meter.

Thanks,
Nick
