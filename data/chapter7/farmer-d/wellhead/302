Production from the SG Marshall leases has increased due to workovers of
some of the wells.  Effective June 14, 2000, please increase the June 1
estimate from 2,300 mmbtu/d to 8,000 mmbtu/d @ HPL Meter 68-6296 delivery
to HPL Thompsonville (PG7E Meter 834134).

Production from the M. Martinez leases has increased due to a new well
behind meter 98-6067.  The estimates from this meter has increased from
4,600 mmbtu/d to 8,200 mmbtu/d.

Please call me at (713) 651-6858 with any questions.   Thanks!!!
