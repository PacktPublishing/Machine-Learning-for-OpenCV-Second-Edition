Bob,

I'm still concern about April's nom; if we don't take it to zero, than we could have the possibility of the allocations group adding volumes to Barrett's April deal.  This would be incorrect.

Bob,

HPLC continues to purchase gas from both Ocean and Seneca on a term basis; firm tickets were submitted for April origination beginning with the month of April.  As for as  Barrett, they are selling their gas under a JOA with Seneca; therefore, 100% of Barrett's production is being paid to Seneca.  Consequently, you should see tickets in sitara for both counterparties.

Let me know is you can't.

Vance,

Are we still purchasing gas at meter 435 from Barrett Resources, Ocean Energy and Seneca Resources?  They were on George's spreadsheet but they are not termed up.  The only deals termed up are Mariner, St. Mary Land, Walter Oil & Gas and The Meridian Resource.

Bob

Bob,

HPLC will be purchasing wellhead gas from the producers listed below for the production month of May, 2001.  This production will be purchased on a "spot" basis and deal tickets should be created and entered into sitara based on the following information:

Counterparty				Meter			Volume			Price
Apache Corporation			0435			1409mmbtu/d			100% IF/HSC less $0.10
Whiting Petroleum Corp			6523			113mmbtu/d			85% IF/HSC		
El Paso Merchant Energy, LP		5923			622mmbtu/d			100% IF/HSC less $0.26
El Paso Merchant Energy, LP		5848			203mmbtu/d			   85% IF/HSC    		                                			     Swift Energy			2630			  21mmbtu/d			100% IF/HSC less $1.38
Duke Energy Trading & Marketing	6347			147mmbtu/d         		   85% IF/HSC
HESCO Gathering Oil Co.		6063			289mmbtu/d			   85% IF/HSC
Embassy Natural Gas Inc.		6598			     1mmbtu/d			   85% IF/HSC 	
Stone Energy				9696		                2745mmbtu/d			100% IF/HSC less $0.20
The Houston Exploration		9696		                3407mmbtu/d			100% IF/HSC less $0.20
Amerada Hess (Hess Energy Svcs)	0435		                1104mmbtu/d			100% IF/HSC  less $0.14
Crosstex Energy Services, Ltd.		0435			 656mmbtu/d			100% IF/HSC less $0.12
Tri-Union Development			0435			 149mmbtu/d			100% IF/HSC less $0.055	
Ranger Oil Company			9871			200mmbtu/d			   85% IF/HSC if <300/d
												   90% IF/HSC if >300/d

These are Producer Svcs. deals and should be tracked in the IM Wellhead portfolio... attached to the gathering contract.

ADDITIONALLY, If at all possible, please do not confirm the Apache and Crosstex deals as we expect to receive term firm contracts in the very near future.

Thanks,
