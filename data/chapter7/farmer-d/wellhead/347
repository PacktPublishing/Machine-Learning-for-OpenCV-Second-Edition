Tom:

 Would you please set up another one month ticket for the below (last month 
was 211573)?

Julie:
 Per Melissa's note please do not send out any paper on this. We expect the 
paper within a day or so.

Please let me know if you have any questions,

Thanks, SCS x 33321

Yes, but I would request that Julie not send out paper since this should be 
back signed shortly.  I noticed the deal Vance requested below (which Tom set 
up as deal 211573) is attached to a committed reserves agreement that does 
not cover this meter.

Can we just use this for April rather then putting in a one month firm ticket 
(since we dont have paper anyway)?

Thanks,

SCS
