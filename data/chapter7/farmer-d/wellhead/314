Daren,  Shore line would like to take meter 9781 from 460 to 1  for the 11 th 
gas day.  It flowed the nom for April so they must be having well problems 
this month.  Meter 9680 has a change from 739 to 1200.  It flowed in the 700 
for April .  Could be new production coming on behind the meter. 

Texaco would like to change meter 9826 from 1201 to 1500 for the rest of the 
month.  In April they flowed from 1000 to 1300.
