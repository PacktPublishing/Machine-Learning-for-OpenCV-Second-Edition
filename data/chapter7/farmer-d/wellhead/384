Daren,

KCS wants to take their nom down from 6,500 to 5,700 on the gathering and 
increase the Texaco transport by the same volume at meter # 9658 beginning 
today.  Are you okay with the change?

Bob

Sorry about the confusion on the dates between the subject line (correctly
reflected) and the body of the letter (incorrectly reflected)...the change
for the "shift" between Texaco and KCS should be March 28, 2001.

This is a revised Josey Ranch nomination for the month of March 2001.  The
HPL nomination volume to be effective 3/28/2001 is:

      5,700 MMBtu/day for KCS Resources
(800 MMBtu/d decrease)
     2,000 MMBtu/day for TEXACO
(800 MMBtu/d increase)
     7,700 MMBtu/day Total (assumed Btu factor of 1.083
@ 14.65 dry) ==> ZERO "net" change

If you need additional information, KCS' field contact is Stretch Brennan in
Victoria: 512 / 576 - 1005.
