Bob, 

HPLC will be purchasing wellhead gas from the producer listed below for the 
production month of July.  This production will be purchased on a "spot" 
basis and a deal ticket should be created and entered into sitara based on 
the following information:

Counterparty    Meter   Volume   Price    

Cody Texas, L.P.   5333   2975mmbtu/d   100% IF/HSC less $0.09

This ticket should be marked evergreen, so that it rolls month to month.

Additionally, this is a Producer Svcs. deals and should be tracked in the IM 
Wellhead portfolio... attached to the gathering contract.

Hillary, 

I noticed deal 305549 has just been put in for one day (6/1/00).  We have 
flow at this meter during the month of June, so could this ticket be changed 
to go through 6/30/00?  

Thanks you,
Melissa
