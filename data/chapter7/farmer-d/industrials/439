I forgot to get with you this morning on this.  I went ahead and changed the 
volume to 24,000.

Thanks.   
Also, Rohm & Haas, meter 1506, is looking for 24.000 for Feb. instead of 
27.000.  They take the swing.  Would you like me to change the deal or keep 
it as is?

Daren - I am looking for 5.000/d at meter 1394 and 10.000/d at meter 8018 for 
Feb.   Currently it is 10.000/d at 1394 and 5.000/d at 8018.  Can I change 
the tickets or will you?  Attached is the confirmation spreadsheet from 
Valero.

Thanks. 

Aimee
