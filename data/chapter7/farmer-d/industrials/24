I spoke to Sabrae,  we are cumulatively balanced with PGE, cumulative and don't want to do anything volumetric at either meter.  The NNG OBA is being reconciled, and they are really hesitant/reluctant to balance current month.  Florida can be paid back 5M or more, it is being reconciled, but, Sabrae is okay with paying back.  This just in from Mark McCoy, the Oasis OBA is flat as of today's gas day.  That should hit the imb. report next week.
