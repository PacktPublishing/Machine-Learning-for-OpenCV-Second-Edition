Julie -
04/01 Price in Sitara for Deal 413462 shows HSC GDP DA for both tiers. Who should I contact to get price corrected to:
10,000/d HSC_FLW+1HIGH GDP DA
11,000/d HSC_FLW+2HIGH GDP DA
(i.e same as pre and post 04/01 prices shown for this deal in Sitara)
Thanks,
Tess

SA 413462 is not the buyback, it's the swing ...

the first 10,000/d under SA 413462 should be HSC_FLW+1HIGH GDP D.A.
anything over 10,000/d should be HSC_FLW+2HIGH GDP DA

this is for all months from Oct00 to Sep01

Please advise on the 04/01 price for sales deal #SA 413462 on this buyback (Swing deal). The contract shows the price for 04/01 should be the same price as shown for 03/01 & 05/01 (i.e. 04/01 price for deal # SA 413462 should be: 10,000 @ HSC_FLW+1HIGH GDP D.A. & 11,000 @ HSC_FLW+2HIGH GDP DA).

Thanks!
