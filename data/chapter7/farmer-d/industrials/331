   I spoke to Anita this morning and she suggested I forward you this request 
to set up a Sitara ticket for an "ENA" deal 
    ticket to handle the buyback on meters 981373 & 981384 that pretain to 
Equistar for June and July 2000.
 
   Equistar invoice can not be drafted without this deal ticket.
 
   This is an urgent request for Settlement to finalize Equistar invoice for 
June 2000 activity.

 Daren wanted me to make this request to you for an Equistar Buyback Ticket 
on Enron North America{ENA}.
 
 Equistar has nominated activity on ENA for June and July 2000 production.
 
 Settlement seems to think a Buyback ticket is necessary to properly account 
for Equistar's monthly activity.
