	Citgo Refinery - Corpus Ship Channel
		Nov 01 - 10,000/d
		Dec 01 - 10,000/d
		and a Nov - Dec 01 
		need El Paso / Valero numbers
		Like to see Crosstex numbers from Banquette/Tejas

	Sterling Chemical - Tx City
		Dec 01 - 7,000/d
		El Paso/Valero
		HPL - preferred delivery to balance internal systems
		Tejas

	
	I spoke with Dan Burns at El Paso yesterday.
	He notionally gave me a $0.04 rate from Exxon Clear Lake
	or comparable source.  Seems a bit high.  
	
	HPL quoted us $0.025 from Katy on the Marathon Refinery
	RFP last week but they wanted $0.25 for swing transport.
	
	Gary talked to Exxon and Tejas about sourcing gas into
	Crosstex (was CC Transmission) at Banquette.  Exxon 
	apparently sells their equity gas at the tailgate of King Ranch
	because of recent changes or elimination of their Tejas
	transportation agreement/s.  

	Lets discuss,
