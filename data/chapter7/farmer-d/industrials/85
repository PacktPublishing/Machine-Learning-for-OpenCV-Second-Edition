Daren -
Howard came by and asked me to check with you regarding deal 717768 starting 
April 6th for 2,000 - it was created by you April 5th. . He wasn't sure if it was a buy back and if you wanted me to
link the buy back deal to 692725. The buyback deal for this is normally 544392(when it was on meter 8216). Do you want
this deal to act as the buy back or stay whole.  Thanks - Julie  

receipt 2,000 deal 717768 - buy back?
delivery 5,500 deal 544388 - daily swing
delivery 8,500 deal 692725 - stays whole first
