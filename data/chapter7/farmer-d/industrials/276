I had to go clean up some stuff at meter # 1428 for Sep00 that will cause a 
reallocation of volumes.

Previously, all activity at the meter was with Beamont Methanol.

Now, for the period Sep 5 to Sep 18, I've entered daily transactions with 
Brandywine in Sitara # 423794

Please call to discuss is any questions
