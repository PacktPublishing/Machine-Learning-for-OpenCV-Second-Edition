Daren,
Howard set up the Shell meters to one buyback ticket - I haven't 
been pathing the shell meters. Before Aimee had it set up
individual and Howard said that it should all be tied to one.

Am I causing a problem by not pathing the meters now?
Should I go back and path the deal changes?
Thanks - Julie
