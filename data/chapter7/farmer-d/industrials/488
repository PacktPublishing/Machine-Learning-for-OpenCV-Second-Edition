got a call last night from Carbide - they rescinded the change from 14,000/d 
rate to 6,000/d rate for safety net gas that was due 9am this morning. 

So here's where we should be now with Carbide:

Seadrift - no saftey net, just the 10,000/d baseload deal

Texas City - 10,000/d of the term deal, plus 14,000/d of safety net, total 
24,000/d

call with questions
