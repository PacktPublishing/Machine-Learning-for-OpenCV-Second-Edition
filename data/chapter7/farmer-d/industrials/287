I have confirmed with Rusty at Shell for October.  Expected flows by meter 
are as follows:

 1060 - East Low Pressure:  35M
 1061 - West Low Pressure: 0M
 1095 - Shell South: 40M
 1581 - Shell High Pressure: 15M

The numbers may flip around in a couple of weeks, after they bring some units 
back on at Meter 1581.  We need to just be sure that they keep a rate between 
points of 90M/Day.

Please let me know if you have any questions, comments.  

Thank you,

Mary
