Tess, 

I have changed Sitara to agree with the contract.  This was changed during flash to get around some pricing errors.

Darren-
Please advise on the 04/01 price for sales deal #SA 413462 on this buyback (Swing deal). The contract shows the price for 04/01 should be the same price as shown for 03/01 & 05/01 (i.e. 04/01 price for deal # SA 413462 should be: 10,000 @ HSC_FLW+1HIGH GDP D.A. & 11,000 @ HSC_FLW+2HIGH GDP DA).

Thanks!
