Are you still available to assist Robert with entering the new deal tickets 
for Equistar?  After talking with Bryan Hull and Anita Luong, Kyle and I 
decided we only need 1 additional sale ticket and 1 additional buyback ticket 
set up.

You'll may want to run this idea by Daren Farmer.  I don't normally add 
tickets into Sitara.

Kyle and I met with Bryan Hull this morning and we decided that we only need 
1 new sale ticket and 1 new buyback ticket set up.  The time period for both 
tickets should be July 1999 - Forward.

The pricing for the new sale ticket should be like tier 2 of Sitara #156337 
below:



The pricing for the new buyback ticket should be like tier 2 of Sitara 
#156342 below:


If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thanks,
