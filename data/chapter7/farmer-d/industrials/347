I went ahead ahead and accepted the nom, put it in at start of the month 
pricing on the base ticket and ignored the 9500 limit, because it's a good 
price!!

Sitara #139066 has a max of 9500 in the flex nom.  Is this correct?  Should 
the additional 1500 be on a swing ticket or included on the index ticket?
