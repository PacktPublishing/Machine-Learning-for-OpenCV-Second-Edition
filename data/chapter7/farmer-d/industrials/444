I think I found the deal.  Deal # 157572 has meter 1372 attached to it.  It 
should be meter 1373.  The 10.000 is split between two meters, but all should 
be at meter 1373.  Can I change it?

Daren - here are the Equistar #'s.  There should be a total of 65.000.  There 
is  a new deal per Janice at Equistar at meter 1373 effective 2/01.  I have 
not seen a deal for this.  Let me know if it is legitimate.  No volumes were 
added, just moved from meter to meter.  (Deal # 378904)  Thanks.
