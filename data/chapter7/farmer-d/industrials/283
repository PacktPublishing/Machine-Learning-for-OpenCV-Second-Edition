We had a deal with Beaumont in Sep00 .... Sitara 380722.  There are swing 
(380725) and buyback (380727) tickets associated with this deal.

For the three days September 16, 17 and 18 ONLY, any volumes over 20,000 
MMBtu per day need to go to a DIFFERENT swing deal ticket, with a different 
counterparty.  I've set this deal ticket up - it is Sitara # 423794

Sorry to make y'all go back and re-assign volumes.

Let me know if any problems or questions.
