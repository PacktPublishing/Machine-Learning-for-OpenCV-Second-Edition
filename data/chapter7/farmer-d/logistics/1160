FYI-
The pricing items noted below are outstanding for March 2000 production.
Furthermore, I am awaiting resolutions from Sherlyn on the PG&E's allocations 
for Feb. & Mar. 2000.

Thanks

Deal # 157288
Per our conversation yesterday afternoon, pls. separate the Centena term deal 
from the spot deal in Sitara for March 2000 production.  
Also, I need to have the price for the East Texas redelivery changed in 
Sitara from HS Index $-.085 to HS Index $-.0825.  This is per the contract 
the price for this redelivery point. 

Thanks
Katherine
