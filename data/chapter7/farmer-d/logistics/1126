This issue still has not been resolved, and it is effecting  the PG&E 
contract 5095-037, HPLC transport contract TA99-027, several deals on the 
interconnect report, and causing payment issues for Katherine Herrera to 
PanEnergy Marketing.  I have sent several emails, faxed the daily's and left 
voice messages, but have not received any updates to this issue.

Sherlyn-

I am looking into this with Lorraine to figure this out.  We did not nominate 
this for the days you are referring to, but Lorraine says she flowed this gas 
even though I cut the volume.  I will let you know when this is resolved.  
Thanks.
