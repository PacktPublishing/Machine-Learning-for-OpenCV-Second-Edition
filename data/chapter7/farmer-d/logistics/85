Can you help me with this?  I sent an email to Bob Cotten because Killam Oil called when they did not receive their payment for May 2001.  Please read the email from George Weissman below and let me know what you think.

Megan, 

The contract covering meters 098-5427 and 098-6831 executed by Hurd Enterprises, Ltd. was terminated effective 2/28/2001.  A replacement contract to cover these points effective 3/1/2001 was subsequently sent to Killam Oil Company, Ltd., but Killam has not yet executed and returned the replacement contract.  I cannot see how we handled Killam in March, but, as indicated below, Enron entered a baseload deal attached to a spot gtc for April - in fact, AEP has entered baseload deals attached to a spot gtc for June, July and August also.  Thus, I would suggest it would be appropriate to enter a baseload deal for Killam at meters 098-5427 and 098-6831 for Killam for May and attach it to a spot gtc. 

The "assignment" from Hurd to Killam is moot.  Since the Hurd contract has been terminated, both Enron and AEP can purchase this gas from Killam, the owner warranting that it has the right to sell this gas, without a contract amendment approving the assignment from Hurd to Killam.

George, 

Please read Megan's e-mail below.  The spreadsheet for May did not reflect any nomination for Killiam Oil.  Did the contract with Killiam terminate?  Should we be purchasing from meter(s) 5427 and/or 6831 and, if so, from what counterparty?  Please advise.  Thanks.

Bob:
I need some help with Killam Oil for May 2001.  They called me yesterday
asking about their May payment because they hadn't received it yet.  I
looked in Path Manager and saw that we did not have any deals with them in
May.  In April, we paid them for gas at HPL meters 985427 and 986831 (deal
742826 and 742829).  The gas at these meters has been put on HPL's
Strangers Gas contract in POPS for May.  Do you know why we do not have any
deals at these meters for May?  I was told by Charles Howard that there is
a pending assignment for these meters form Hurd to Killam.  He said for
June 2001, AEP paid Hurd.  Do you know who we are suppose to pay for May?
I would appreciate any help you can give me.

Thanks,
Megan
