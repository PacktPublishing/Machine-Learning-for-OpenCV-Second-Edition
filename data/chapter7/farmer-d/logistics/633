George, 

Gary called me about this Shut In situation a few minutes ago, specifically 
regarding Meter 6722.  This meter is at the tailgate of Three Rivers, 
therefore, an HPL field employee will not be able to contact the producer 
(they probably have no idea where the gas is coming from that goes through 
this meter).  

Gary suggested that the deal maker contact these producers verbally, and then 
Connie Sutton will follow up with written notice.  Per our discussion, since 
Mary Jo and Gary are out this afternoon, I am forwarding this message to you. 

The concerned contracts are:  Cody Texas, LP, 012-64365-101, 96018049 and 
Samson Lone Star, 012-77555-105, 96016761.

Let me know if there is further information that I can provide.

Thank you, 
Melissa
