Is this Enerfin gas we delivered?  What are the deal numbers in Sitara and 
how much volume are we talking about?
Darren, Isn't there an OBA set up in Enerfin that can handle small volumes?  
THANKS

Victor,

What's your opinion on this?  Can we go back and add days to prior month 
deals?  Do we use the same price?  If we do decide to do this, we will need 
to get TETCO to agree to do a retro for those days as well.

Subject: 10/2000 - Days 6 and 19 (98-0439)

The above referenced days have been placed on strangers gas due to (I guess) 
the meter not being turned off in time.  The day prior to each of these days 
that are assessed to strangers gas, the only active K is the HPL 216.

Can these deals be rolled to cover these couple of days?

Thanks
