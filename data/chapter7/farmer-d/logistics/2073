Subject: point change for deals

FYI---I changed points on this deal from PGTT-TECO Waha 18002800 to PGTT-TECO 
Katy 20606100 for the 2nd.  Let me know if you don't agree with this.  The 
supply, Duke Field Svs, was originally trying to deliver to HPL at Midtex, 
this deal #589257 was also changed to meter 20606100.

Thanks,
Mark
