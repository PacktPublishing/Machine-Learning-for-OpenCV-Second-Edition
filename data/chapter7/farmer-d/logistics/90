Daren:
I'm not sure if you can help me, but I have a Danny Conner deal from Decemb=
er 2000 that has a price issue. =20

We were buying gas from The Houston Exploration Company on Black Marlin, Hi=
gh Island 138/HPL meter 98663, deal 508426.  The deal was priced at HSC - 0=
.14.  In December, a new platform came on, High Island 115/HPL meter 986431=
.  It did not start flowing until the 20th.  Danny did not put a new deal i=
n for this meter, so we combined the gas on deal 508426.  The Houston Explo=
ration thinks that the gas at HI 115 should be kept separate and priced at =
HSC GD - 0.14 since it did not begin flowing until the 20th.  We agree that=
 we received the gas.  We have the pipeline statement from Black Marlin.  W=
e just don't have the same pricing.  The Houston Exploration shows that we =
owe them an additional $222k due to this price difference.  We only purchas=
ed this gas in Dec 2000 and Jan 2001.  The deal for Jan, 547063, was priced=
 at GD - 0.14.  Can you verify how this deal should be priced?  I sent this=
 issue to Danny back in January and he said the IF price was correct, but T=
he Houston Exploration is sticking to their price.  If you need to talk to =
their trader, his name is Lester Lipperdt 713-830-6960.
