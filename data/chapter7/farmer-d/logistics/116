Elizabeth, 

Can you extend the contract with D&H under deal 70120 for 1 month to cover this volume?

I did a search and found no deals for May for this counterparty.  Call
Daren Farmer at 713-853-6905, and he could probably put the deal in for
you.

Julie -
Need your help again....
D&H gas Company, faxed their 05/01 volume support for HPL Meter 428
(980428), whihc reflects ENA gas sales to D&H for 5/11/01, 143 mmbtu and
5/31/01 for 286 mmbtu for a total of 429 mmbtu for 05/01. he deal last
month (04/01), was SA-70120. I don't have see a  sales draft  under ENA or
HPL for 05/01 sales to D&H, nor do I see any 05/01 sales deal under
SA-70120.

Can you assist me in finding out if there was a sale to D&H in 05/01, and
if so, what is the deal number and where is sales draft?

Thanks!
Tess
