Hi Daren,

The attached spreadsheet could be used to help you in the collection of the 
hours for your group prior to entering into the database sent to you by James 
Scribner.  It includes a place for your FTE's, hours by position & activity 
and the activity definitions for your cost center.  Please let me know if you 
have any questions.

Thanks,
Suzanne
