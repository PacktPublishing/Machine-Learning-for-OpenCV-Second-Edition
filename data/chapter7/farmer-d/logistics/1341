The Samson well will be coming on this afternoon at 1.5 to 2.5 million/d and 
increasing to 10mmbtu/d by Sept 1.  This gas should be diverted into the 
Duke/ Sheridan interconnect.  Gas is priced at Gas Daily for this intermonth 
flow and goes to IFHSC for the term contract.  Please call if you have any 
questions.  Thanks,  MJJ
