Daren,

I would like for these sessions to be separate, only because my group is 
probably at a different level than Lisa's in terms of understanding the 
business (not that we understand it in its entirety).  The last week of this 
month or the first week of March prior to the 6th workday is good for my 
group(s).  Let me know.  Thanks!

Rita and Lisa, 

Why don't ya'll get together and determine a range of days/times that would 
work for your groups to have a training session.  (Over lunch or early 
afternoon)  If you are interested, I would like to discuss how we operate the 
HPL system and the processes we go through during the trading day.  To help 
with the discussion, I have maps which highlight the main points and areas 
where we transact.  (There will be a few for you to keep at the desks.)  

I did this with the Logistics group.  I think it went pretty well.  If you 
want to do this, we need to allow 1.5 to 2 hours to talk about everything.  
Let me know.  

D
