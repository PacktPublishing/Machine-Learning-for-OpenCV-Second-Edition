Daren,

I am handling CP&L and am trying to resolve this issue from February production.  CP&L shows 5,000 mmbtu on February 21, but we do not have a deal.  Were you able to find anything out about this?

Thanks for your help.

Rebecca

Can we verified this gas flowed?  If it did it should have been billed on his term deal if there was one in place.  If the gas flowed and we did not invoice for it on term let me know and I will put it in.
