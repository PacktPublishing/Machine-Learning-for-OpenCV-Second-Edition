As soon as someone from global counterparties gets here I am going to have them activate the old contracts so that Mike can finish pathing.  

Mike--I will send you an email to let you know when they are active.

Mike/Stephen,

Have the two of you been able to get the deal in for the sale of the Centana storage to AEP?  Please advise.  I would like to have this completed for this close if possible.

Daren - if you are not aware of this transaction, please let me know.  Thanks!
