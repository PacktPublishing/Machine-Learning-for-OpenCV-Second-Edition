Hi Daren,

I know that this is a busy part of the day for you.  But, when you get a 
minute, can you please extend deal #465322 for cover a flow volume of 140 
dec. for 11/21/2000?

Thanks

Jackie, 465490 is not a deal between ENA and HPL.. It is a Zone 5 Tennessee 
sale between ENA and a third party...Thanks
