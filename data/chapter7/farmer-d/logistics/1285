Since we cannot fix the deal, go ahead and put a fixed price of $2.81359 on 
both lines of the May 2000 deal.  This will allow us to pay correctly.  If 
you can, please put some comments in the deal noting the true deal price so 
we have an audit trail.  Just let me know when it is done.

Thanks,
Megan
