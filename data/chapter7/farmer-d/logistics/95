I have not heard back from Mike Olsen on this.  Can you extend this deal for me?

Mike:
I need to have deal 637225 extended to include April and May 2001.  The allocations we received from El Paso show that HPLC sold gas to them at meter 6884 for both months.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Megan
