We need to revisit this issue again.   There is an exception at meter 4045 
for 2/99.   In order to clear this up, I need an ECT transport delivery at 
this meter for the 34000mmbtu.   See July's allocations in POPS for 
reference.    The displacement gas were scheduled as a delivery. 

I would like to have this issue resolved as soon as possible so that we 
could  clear this off our list.

Let me know if you have questions.

Thanks

Kim,

ECT sold 34,000mmbtu to PanEnergy at meter 4045 for 2/99.   I've verified w/ 
Rebekah Seales and she has determined that ECT did sell this gas to 
PanEnergy.  Therefore, we need to show a delivery at this meter for PanEnergy 
or whomever PanEnergy is selling this gas to at this point in POPS.  I need a 
delivery at this meter in order for this meter to balanced.  

Please take a look at this.  Call me if you have questions

Thanks.

Anita:

I did some additional research regarding the sale to PanEnergy at meter 4045 
on 2/27 and 2/28.  This sale was a brokered deal.



DATE   PURCHASE   VOLUME  SALE
2/27 & 2/28  Phillips Gas Mkt. (#55397)  10.000 MMBtu  PanEnergy Marketing 
(#64749) 10.000 MMBtu
2/27 & 2/28  Superior Natural Gas (#57065)   7.000 MMBtu  PanEnergy Marketing 
(#64749)   7.000 MMBtu

ECT did not transport this gas away from meter 4045.  If this gas was 
transported away from meter 4045, it would have been a transaction between 
PanEnergy Marketing (or whomever they sold the gas to at that point) and 
HPL.  Hope this information helps.

RS

Additional info I see in Path Manager..................

Seems like this is a brokered deal, ECT is buying 20,000mmbtu from Philips 
Gas and 14,000mmbtu from Superior Gas and sell the total 34,000mmbtu to 
PanEnergy.

My question is then who is paying for the tranport of this gas, ECT or 
PanEnergy?  We need to schedule for the delivery of this gas at meter 984045.

Please let me know

Thanks
