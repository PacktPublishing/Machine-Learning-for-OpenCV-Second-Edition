Megan, 

	I found Danny's book and he has the deal priced at 5.25.  I adjusted the price in Sitara.  Let me know if anything further is needed.

For once his is not a Panenergy question.  For sale deal 707274, DEFS says the price on 4/4 should be 5.25 and we have 5.20 in Sitara.  Can you confirm this price for me?
