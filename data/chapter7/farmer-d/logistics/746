Jackie I  talked with Daren and we would like to wait for now, It is a little 
early in the month and the well may be just getting revved up.  Wells tend to 
move around a bit through the month and usually  even out at the end but 
thank you for bringing it to my attention and please feel free to inform me 
of any others that you might see.  The more eyes the better.  Thanks Jackie.
