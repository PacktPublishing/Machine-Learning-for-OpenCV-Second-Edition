Subject: OPM Hours Survey - January, 2001 - CHANGES!! PLEASE READ!


It's that time again to enter your hours and activities for January, 2001.  
Please use the shortcut below or go to the following path O:\Energy_Ops\OPM 
Hours Survey\ProdUser to access the hours survey.

PLEASE NOTE THAT THERE ARE SOME CHANGES THIS MONTH IN THE SURVEY.  THEY ARE 
AS FOLLOWS:

1) You must use your new SAP cost center in the survey this month.  I have 
attached a file that converts your old cost center incase you don't know what 
your new one is.

2) Due to the SAP cost center conversion, we were unable to roll over 
previous months commercial teams and headcount (FTE) information.  Therefore, 
we need you to enter the commercial teams your cost center supports and the 
FTE's in your cost center.  We will roll this information over beginning next 
month.

3) In previous months you were able to print a report that showed your prior 
months hours by activity.  Due to the SAP cost center conversion, that 
function is not available this month.  It will be available next month.  If 
you need your hours for prior months please call me and I will forward this 
information to you.

When completing the FTE's section of the survey, if there are any Director, 
Sr. Admin or Admin positions in your cost center, please complete 
accordingly.  You are not expected to complete a hours survey for these 
positions but we do need them to be included in your FTE's.

Please have your survey's completed by Wednesday, February 7.  Please call me 
if you have any questions or need me to help you complete the survey.

Thanks,
Suzanne
