Subject: Change name on pipeline, Contract No. Teco9121, Global Contract No.

Please be advised that Contract No. Teco9121 shows in the Global Contract 
system as PG&E Texas Pipeline, L.P., however, the pipeline name should be 
PG&E Gas Transmission Teco, Inc..  Apparently, the pipeline name was entered 
into the global system incorrectly. I have confirmed this with Charles Berner 
in the Contracts Administration section and Kim Watson, both with PG&E Gas 
Transmission Teco, Inc..  The contract name should be PG&E Gas Transmission 
Teco, Inc.


I would like to change the pipeline to reflect the correct pipeline name 
effective April 1, 2000.  Thus it will not affect the previous noms for this 
contract.


All please respond to let me know if this will cause problems with 
replication or anything else with the system.


Julie and Stacey,  Deal No. 47434 is attached to this contract you may need 
to change this in your system.
