Repairs to the Wilson Creek lateral were completed on Monday afternoon 
7/10/00.  Upon completion of repairs HMS found excessive corrosion on the 
meter run and notified pumper that they would remain shut-in until the 
producer replaced or repaired the meter run.  Once the meter run is replaced 
or repaired the lateral will be purged and packed and put back into service.

If you have any questions please call me at 36449.

Thanks
