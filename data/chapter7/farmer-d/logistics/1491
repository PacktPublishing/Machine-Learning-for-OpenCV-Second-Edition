Subject: Texas Energy Reliability Council Meeting

Team,

On 15 November, Steve and Tom S. will represent HPL at a meeting of the Texas 
Energy Reliability Council hosted by Commissioner Michael Williams to discuss 
the outlook for gas supply and demand in Texas this winter.  I will dial in 
by phone once I am free from another meeting that morning.

Tom S.  can you find out more detail as to what we need to be ready to 
discuss and then coordinate with the appropriate HPL people to ensure we are 
prepared at the meeting.  Specifically, does James or anyone else need to 
attend or be on the call?

Thanks,
Brian
