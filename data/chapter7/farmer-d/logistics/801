Daren - Meters 3002 and 3003 have volume from Jan 99 thru the current month.  
Could a deal be created for these volumes? There is a substanital amount of 
volume each month.

Aimee:

Following is a list of allocation exceptions on Daily Swing meters that must 
be fixed.  
Meter 3003 with Min Gas Date 01/02/99
Meter 3002 with Min Gas Date 01/02/99
Meter 0598 with Min Gas Date 08/01/99
Meter 5360 with Min Gas Date 0/01/00

Do you think that we can get them fixed by Tuesday the 15th of this week?

Let me know,

Fred
