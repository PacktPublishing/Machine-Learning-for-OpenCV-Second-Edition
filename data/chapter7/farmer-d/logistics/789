I will create a committed reserves ticket for the remaining term of the deal 
once our geologists have gathered enough data to forecast the reserves of 
this well, at such time, we will request that this ticket be zeroed out.

Please supply the sitara number once entered.  If you have any questions, 
please give me a call.

Tom,

The Doehrman #1 well came on line for first delivery on Monday, 2/7/00 at 
11:45am.  The contract calls for intra-month pricing for deliveries that 
commence after the first day of the month.  Please create a one month 
baseload firm deal ticket for the remaining days of the month based on the 
following information:

Susan will create a committed reserves firm ticket for the remaining term of 
the deal once our geologists have gathered enough data to forecast the

Thanks,
