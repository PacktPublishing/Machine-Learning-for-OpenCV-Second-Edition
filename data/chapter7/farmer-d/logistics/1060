You Bastards!  You're taking 60% of my profit?  This deal should be flowing 
and I recently did a deal ticket for May 00 going forward.  I thought it was 
on evergreen.

Please advise.

Craig

Heidi-  There should be a deal ticket in Sitara for this sale to Engage, but 
it looks as though 12/99 was the last month a deal was entered 
(IF/HSC+1.00).  George/Craig- could you guys coordinate who should be rolling 
this deal or let us know if this gas should not be flowing?  Heidi-  
historically we've been charging $.60/mm for this transport.

I am finding flow out there on HPL 215 for meter 1520 (Tx City Coastal 
States) starting 4/1/00 (actually, no volume was scheduled but looks like it 
has been allocated since March 1).  Did you want a premium rate for this?
