Currently, these volumes are being booked under the HPL Strangers Gas 
Contract.  Logistics needs either a deal to record these volumes which have 
flowed into HPL's  pipeline or Logistics needs approval to writeoff these 
volumes to Unaccounted for Gas.  (Please print, sign, and return original to 
Clem Cernosek).  There was no deal at this meter the previous month or the 
later month.
