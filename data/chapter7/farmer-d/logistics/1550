Attached please find a schedule that shows all the active HPL Inter-Company 
Contracts that are recorded in the Global Contract System.  The dark shaded 
contracts are needed to perform HPL's daily/monthly activities.    Each of 
these have a comment.  

The lightly shaded contracts had activity in Year 2000, but  will not be 
needed for future activities.

The non- shaded contracts did not have any activity in Year 2000, and will 
not be needed for future activities.

This schedule was compiled by using information provided by Cheryl Dudley, 
Rita Wynne,  Daren Farmer, &   Clem's Expertise.

If you have any questions, please feel free to call any or all of us.





Thanks, Clem
