Eric Bass, Texas Desk trader, requested the following product described below 
be traded on EnronOnline. This product will NOT bridge into Sitara and will 
have to be put in manually. 

The reason it will not bridge is due to the fact that it can have multiple 
stripes of start & end dates rather than one start & end date. Currently, 
EnronOnline can
only send one start & end date per deal therefore it will fail in the bridge 
monitor and will have to be manually entered into Sitara & subsequently 
cleared out of the monitor. 

Since these transactions could flow next day, it is imperative that these 
transactions get into Sitara as soon as possible. Please read the FULL 
description below. (This product looks like a month long deal but excludes 
weekends. The "Wkd" is short for week days.)

We do not anticipate a large volume of these transactions but need to be 
prepared to react quickly when they do. For the future, we are looking into 
the cost/benefit of EnronOnline having the capability of sending multiple 
dates for these types of products.

If you have any questions, please call me at 3-5824
Thank you.

We are rolling out the use of the 24 x 5 Nat Gas Product commencing tomorrow, 
May 24th. 

The Product is a month-long Physical Nat Gas Product traded off the Texas 
desk. It will be identified as follows:

US Gas Phy       Exxon Katy WkD          Jun00           USD/MM

This Product is different from the usual Products traded on the Texas Desk in 
that the Product  description has an 
indicator of  WkD, which designates that the Product only moves gas on a day 
that is a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, 
Thursday or Friday.

These Products WILL NOT bridge into Sitara. Risk personnel will need to be 
diligent to identify these Products based 
on the information in the Product Description to ensure that the Products are 
entered into Sitara correctly (presumably - 
strips of Monday-Friday trades and the corresponding month-starting days 
and/or month-ending days).

We understand the potential impact of having to manually input these 
transactions and have asked the appropriate
systems personnel to examine the links between EOL and Sitara and consider 
building bridge capability. In the
interim, we anticipate that the trading volume on these Products will be low, 
and will ask for higher prioritization of the
bridging in the event that volumes increase.
