The POPS Production database server will be down over the weekend for a 3 
hour period
for memory upgrade. Please let me know if there is a preferred 3hr window, if 
there is
no problem with y'all,  can we will request the maintenance  between 12-3pm 
Saturday 10/21/00.

I'll inform y'all of the actual timeframe once its finalized, since there are 
other systems
running on that server.

thanks
Romeo

The UNIX Infrastructure team  would like to request downtime on system
'aurora' this weekend.  The system has 2 faulty memory simms that we need
to replace BEFORE they cause a problem.  We are requesting 3 hours to
perform the memory replacement.  The following databases would be effected:

eqtprod
dcfprod
popprod
trdprod
semprod
sitprod2
infprd53

Please let me know if/when we can have time for this maintenance.
