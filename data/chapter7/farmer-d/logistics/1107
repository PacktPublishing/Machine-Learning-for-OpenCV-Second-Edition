Okay, this one has been resolved....   the deals for days 9 and 10 are good.  
Sitara did not feed this deal to MOPS at all therefore it didn't feed to 
POPS.  

Sherlyn is setting things up and will provide me with a tracking ID, I will 
enter volumes and re-allocate the meter.

Very confusing but finally resolved.

Subject: I/C variance for deal 72893

Charlotte,

There is an interconnect variance at meter 980071 for 2/99.   It appears the 
variance is created on 2/9/99 and 2/10/99.  There is a transport usage deal 
ticket 72893 in Sitara which shows PG&E delivers 6,965 mmbtu to HPL on 2/9/99 
and 3,683 mmbtu on 2/10/99, but HPL does not show a receipt of this volume.   
Let me know if you need the PG&E support.
