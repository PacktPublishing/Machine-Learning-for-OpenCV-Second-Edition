Hey guys,

Just wanted to make known my concerns on this issue.  While I agree that 
Howard, Robert and George needed to work on this together, I do not think 
that Howard should have been the driving force behind this.  Once we left the 
meeting, they all convened on the 37th floor and worked from Howard's desk - 
with Howard sitting down doing much of the work.  I also think that the below 
e-mail should not have come from Howard, but should have originated out of 
the Logistics group.  I understand that Howard has prior scheduling 
experience, but he is not functioning in a scheduling role now and bascially 
took on that role in getting this set up correctly.  He too had to sit down 
and try to figure out what needed to be done and set everything up correctly 
(?).  In my opinion this is a kudoo for Howard for stepping up, but I am 
concerned at the role that he played.  Team effort is important and it's what 
we all want between our groups, but I want to ensure that everyone does their 
fair share and expectations are appropriately placed.  Let me know what you 
both think.  Thanks!

Subject: Cilco Pathing - Withdrawl and HPLC transport pathing


Cilco needs to be pathed the following way on a withdrawl day or month
   The pathing that was done for December 1999 and January 2000 worked.
