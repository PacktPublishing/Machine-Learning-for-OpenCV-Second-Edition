My latest understanding is the buyback will be in place through 12/31/99.

A new deal for 15,000/ day begins 1/1/00 and currently has no buyback 
provision.

Gary,
I have been notified that there is a possibility that the buyback  was not 
effective for Lyondell Citgo.  Could you please inform me via CC mail what 
the status of the buyback is once you have reviewed it.
