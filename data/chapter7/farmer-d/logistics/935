Cheryl Jones has just left me a message letting me know that their 
programmers are working on a fix to the problem as we speak.  Cheryl is 
postponing our meeting for tomorrow till she has more information from the 
programmers.  Mike,  Cheryl  said her boss (Gary Anderson) has sent you a 
response to your concerns about this same problem could you let us all know 
what his response is.  In the mean time,  George could you give us a list of 
the known meters that were having  this problem with so I can give it to 
Cheryl,  and I'll try to get some kind of time frame from Cheryl as to when 
we can expect to hear something back from them.  Thanks to all.
