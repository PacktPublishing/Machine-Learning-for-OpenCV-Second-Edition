Shawna -  In addition to the meters sent to you in the earlier memo on the 
McMullen system, the following meters were shut in at approximately 12:00 PM 
on Thursday, December 9, 1999.  These meters were shut in order to install 
pigging facilities to remove liquids from the McMullen 12".  These producers 
should be brought back on-line sometime in the afternoon of December 10. 1999.

989638  Freeman Production - Maxine Field

Once pigging facilities are in place, the McMullen 12" will be pigged 
(sometime early next week, week of Dec. 13) and all of the producers in the
