Jackie, Talk to Darren about this. The deal you reference is an HPL deal with 
Dynegy and I don't have access to it. I'm on the East desk. Yesterday I 
extended the deal 421415 for the 6th and 19th and Meredith inserted a path in 
Unify - TETCO  to cover the small overflow volume between HPL and ENA. The 
ENA/HPL piece is done. The piece between HPL and Dynegy is what you need 
inserted.THANKS

Sherlyn, I've placed the correct volumes for days 6 and 9 for ENA.  I'll have 
the deal extended for Dynegy and let you know when it's done.

Victor, can you extend the deal 422516 for days 6 and 9 please?  Thanks.  Oh 
and by the way, I had mistaken you for someone else when I sent you the 
e-mail on yesterday.  Sorry.  I thought that I knew you.  Anyway, please 
advise when you've extended the deal so that Sherlyn can create an accounting 
arrangement.

Thanks

I don't want to tell you to add any contracts, because I am not sure about 
that.   I am just saying if you look at Ray's schedule there are 2 deals out 
there, one is a purchase from ENA and the other a purchase from Dynegy.  The 
track id I gave you was for ENA.   You  cannot allocate the Dynegy piece 
until I give you a track id.   I cannot give you a track id until the deal is 
extended for days 10/6 and 10/19.

Arre you saying that for both days that two (2) ENA contracts should be 
placed at the meter for days 6 and 19 and then allocating half of the the 
total volume to each contract?

Jackie,
You did not allocate this according to Ray's schedule.  The track id I gave 
you was only for the purchase from ENA.   You need to extend the deal for the 
purchase from Dynegy.   You put all of the volume on these 2 days on ENA, 
that is not what is on Ray's schedule, so we are still out on the 
interconnect report.

Accounting arrangement has been placed.  Meter has been reallocated.

Thanks and let me know if you need anything else.

Jackie,

Your allocation is correct with the exception of days 10/6 and 10/19 where 
strangers gas is allocated.    I have created an accounting arrangement for 
these days and the new track id for ENA is 240384.  Please allocate the ENA 
portion according to Rays schedule for these 2 days.    Deal 422516 (Purchase 
from Dynegy) needs to be extended for these 2 days so I can do an accounting 
arrangement.   Alfonso  I need for you to allocate your meter daily, because 
we have tiered pricing this month.

Thanks.
