As you are aware, we broke a shaft in the MUG compressor on the methanol
unit at Clear Lake on Saturday March 11th.  We originally anticipated a two
week outage for repairs.  Unfortunately, due to delays in the delivery of a
coupling needed to finish repairs, we have extended the downtime for
another week.  We hope to be up April 2nd or 3rd if all goes well.
