Deal #157288
Location: Centana
Days:  3/11-3/31 (gas is not a part of the exchange agreement).  

I need to have the spot deal placed on a different deal ticket than the 
exchange deal (#157288).
Will you break out this spot deal separately?



Thanks for fixing the price for the ETXG gas system in March.

Daren-
Have you had a chance to change the pricing in the system? 
Duke has called me several times they want to get our March deals finalized.
I am not sure what I should tell them.  
Thanks-

Deal # 157288
Per our conversation yesterday afternoon, pls. separate the Centena term deal 
from the spot deal in Sitara for March 2000 production.  
Also, I need to have the price for the East Texas redelivery changed in 
Sitara from HS Index $-.085 to HS Index $-.0825.  This is per the contract 
the price for this redelivery point. 

Thanks
