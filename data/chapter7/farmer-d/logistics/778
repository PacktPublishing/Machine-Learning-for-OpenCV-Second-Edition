Subject: Transport P/L (With Fuel) Report

Just wanted to inform all of you about the new report option that is now 
available in CPR Print Manager.  The new report includes the same information 
that is found on the "Transport Profit/Loss" report plus fuel detail 
information that was not available on the original report.  Examples of the 
additional fuel detailed information that can be found on the new report are 
listed below:
Fuel Percent
Fuel Volume
Fuel Charge 

The new report can be found in CPR Print Manager in the Estimated Economics 
Report category as illustrated below.  If you have any questions regarding 
this new "Transport P/L (With Fuel)" report, please call me at x35423.
