Daren,

I have some flow at the above referenced meter without a deal.  Flow was for 
the first 2 days only, and probably occured as the meter was in the process 
of being shut in.  We purchased the gas from Torch-Rally Partnership in 
Sept.  Can you extend the deal, or should I allocated off to strangers?

Please advise.

Mary
