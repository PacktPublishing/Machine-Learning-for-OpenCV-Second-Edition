Kim,  

Will you please get with Mary Smith and Trisha Hughes with the Texas Rates 
group
and pick up from them the off system pipeline rates that they are handling.

You may want to visit with Daren Farmer also about the level of activity.

We need to transition this work to your team as soon as possible.

thanks

bob
