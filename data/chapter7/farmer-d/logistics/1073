Stacey-

As per my earlier voice mail messages, I needed to confirm what the actual 
flow of gas was on PG&E for February 24th.  The Service Summary Report from 
PG&E indicated a flow of 50,000 mmbtus on the 24th, however, the Swamp Rat 
Fuel Allocations (HPL) indicates a flow of 53,000 mmbtus.  Can you ask PG&E 
to confirm which of these volume is correct so that the February allocations 
can be finalized?  Please let me know if there is any additional information 
I need to provide you.  

Thanks for your help-

Katherine
