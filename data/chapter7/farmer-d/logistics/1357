Daren,

Below is Volume Management's answers to Gary's questions.

I'm now awaiting on an e-mail from Gary as to the direction that he is going 
to take.  I will follow suit according to his instructions.  

Should you come aboard, I'll await your decision as well.

Again, thanks.

Subject: Meter 984132 for 1/16/99

Here is the issue for 1/16/99 at meter 984132.   

20,000 mmbtu were confirmed for Adonis in POPS.   10,000 mmbtu on day 5 and 
day 16.   Day 16 is not valid for deal 51862 (track id 6155), which is where 
10,000 was confirmed.   The  actual sale to Adonis was 10,000 which was 
invoiced and paid by Adonis.  We are trying to clear the feedback error 
report.   My question is why was 10,000 confirmed on 1/16/99 if the date is 
not valid for the deal?

When Karen allocates the actual 10,000 it is prorating 5,000 for each day 
that is confirmed (the 5th and 16th).  

Should the whole 10,000 be allocated to the 5th or should 5,000 be allocated 
to each day?   If 5,000 should be allocated to each day, the 16th needs to be 
added to the deal.
