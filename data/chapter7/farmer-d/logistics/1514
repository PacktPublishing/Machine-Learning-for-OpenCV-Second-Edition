I need HPL Sales and Purchases, back dated to 8/99 between HPL and TECO to 
book any processing revenue or losses.  Apparently this is in addition to the 
current deal in place and is priced at at different rate.  Please let me know 
when these tickets are in place so that I can get track id's and finalize 
this issue.

Thank you,

Mary
