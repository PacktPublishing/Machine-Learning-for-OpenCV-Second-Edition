Karen,

I've looked in POPS and on day 16 of January 1999, I see a total confirmed 
volume of 61,365 and an actual of 62,151.  If I'm understanding you 
correctly, you're asking me to allocate all of this volume to deal #51862.

If so, that's incorrect.  Several deals are associated the this days volume.

Please write back or phone back with further details.

Thanks

Jackie, 

Volume is allocating to deal number 51862 on 1/16/99 on meter 984132, however 
the deal does not have this day on it.  Please have 1/16 added to the deal so 
the error will clear.

Thanks and if you need additional info, let me know.

Karen
