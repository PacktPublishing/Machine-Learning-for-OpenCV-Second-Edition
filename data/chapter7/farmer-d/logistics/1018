98-1534 is on the 215K for 3/2000 but is only good for 3/1 - 3/1 in Sitara, 
on deal #163005.  Can you see if it is o.k. to extend the deal for the rest 
of the month?  It has flow every day after the 1st.

98-6725 is also on the 215K for 3/2000.  The Sitara deal # is 214948 and 
covers every day except for day 16.  Can you also see if it is o.k. to extend 
the deal to cover this day?

Thanks
