According to Gary Hanks, we would like to have the gas on the valley line 
anyway

I can not believe you are sending emails form Hawaii!!!!  You are crazy.  I 
took care of Camden for the month-
It is now 330 and Hilcorp has not responded.  I spoke with Jerry Bubert 
several times today- emailed Mike LAnnou and left messages, and had him 
paged, and copied Hildebrand (the president).  If we don't hear by 4pm, we 
are supposed to bypass the gas...........
