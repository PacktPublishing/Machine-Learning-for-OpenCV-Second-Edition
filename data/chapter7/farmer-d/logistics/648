I leave this with you. My take is that the situation is as I suspected and 
Pat wants me to pretty much leave them be. I will do that unless I hear a 
different plan from you.

Ken,
I think Robert has a good handle on things and can function on his own.  With 
that said, we always want different
checks and balances in place in order to capture the most accurate 
information, so if you see something that is
a problem please bring it to our attention.  Thanks,  Pat

I believe the transition to be complete as we have, at least, been over the 
ground on all the subjects.  Would you like me to continue offering advise 
and assistance or let Robert function entirely on his own?
