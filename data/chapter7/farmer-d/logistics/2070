I spoke to her over the phone and told her that we were short of the nom and 
she told me that a buy back needs to be put into place..  HL&P has paid us 
for the full 20,000 on the 27th.   We have a Entex Meeting on the 5th in Room 
37C1 @ 11:30, we can all discuss it then if you want to.

We will need to wait until Janet gets back.  This is a spot deal that was 
done by Gary Lamphier.  Did Janet negotiate something with them after the 
fact?
