On 5/1/2000 recorded flow of 9 Mmbtus from HPL's pipeline.   Deal #222051 was 
at this meter during April 2000, but the deal expired on 4/30/2000.  
Currently, this volume is being booked to the HPL Stranger Gas Contract.  
Logistics needs either (1) Deal #222051, (2) New Deal, or (3) approval to 
write-off this volume to Unaccounted for Gas.  (Please print, sign, and 
return original to Clem Cernosek).
