Daren - What happened in Feb. was that Transco had allocated a different 
amount other than our measurement. I had been working with Fred on getting 
some allocations resolved for several different months.  Transco told us they 
would not go back and reallocate due to the statute of limitations (6 
months).  February had a significant amount not allocated.  We just need a 
deal set up so we can write these volumes off.  Let me know if you have any 
more questions.
