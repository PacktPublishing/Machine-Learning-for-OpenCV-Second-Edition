1. Tom asked for a historical number for Entex the 2nd week on the job in t=
he=20
morning meeting. He wasn=01,t expecting me to bring forth anything because =
I had=20

decided to look it up and do it myself. Tom was very pleased.

2. Tom gave that info to Ed, and he asked for further data:

a. About Cinco ranch, Greatwood, and Spring interconnects

I coordinated with Brad Blevins and applied it to the fact that origination=

remain in close contact to share any Entex interconnect info.

b. Research transport info

Documented why Entex Transport volumes decreased by 6000, and used info=20

corresponded with historical data related to the average of the forecast. T=
om=01,
s response was, "This is great. Why hasn=01,t anyone been able to do this=
