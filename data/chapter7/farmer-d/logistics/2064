You put a deal in for Torch for this time frame at this meter to clear an 
exception.  Should we put a new deal in with Cleco?  Let me know.

I have a note in Pops that Daren extended the Torch deal at this meter for 
October.  If they are disputing the deal, please let me know and I will clear 
this up with them.
