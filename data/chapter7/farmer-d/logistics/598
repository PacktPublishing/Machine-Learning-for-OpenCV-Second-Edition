Just to clarify, its not the relative age of the production date, but the age 
of the event itself.

Scotty/Richard,

Our DBAs would like to see what we can do to reduce the qty of rows in 
Contract_Event_Status.  We have over 1 Gig of data in that table.  I would 
like to suggest we have a nightly or weekly or monthly process to delete any 
row with a Last_Mod_Date over a month (or two) old.  So if someone balances 
February 1999 this month, we will keep it around for a month (or two).

Does any one else have a desire to keep this data for a shorter/longer period 
of time?

This is not an audit table.  This is just a "log" every nom/track/balance/EDI 
send/Fax send/sched qty/quick response since the beginning of time.

d.n.
