Dave,

Please have Steve remove the meters in the following list from the estimate 
file.  These were accounting meters set up to represent the offsetting 
physical meters.  The physical meters should still receive estimates.

If you have any questions please call.

Gary

Gary,

Could you please remove  SCADA/MIPS from the following HPL meters. These 
meters are where Mid-Texas interconnects with
PG & E's system, and there should not be any measurement taking place on HPL. 
These meters were set up originally when we thought
that every meter on Mid-Texas should automatically have a corresponding meter 
on HPL. This assumption is now incorecct.
