Following are the responses I received to the question:  Please ask your schedulers to e-mail me which pipelines still maintain the ability to do Nominations via a dial up connection to their EBB (modem and a phone line).
Please ask them to call their representatives if unsure.


Pipelines that require or can use dial up for EBB access	
from responses to an e-mail mailed out to all managers in Houston, Denver and Calgary
