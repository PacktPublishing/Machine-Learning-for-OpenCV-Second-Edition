Duane and Cindy need a list of the individuals needed this training.  Please 
respond directly to them if members of your shops need to attend.  If there 
are other areas I have not considered please let them know.

Thanks

The training will focus on the drill down into the FERC numbers in SAP.
The view role is going to be taught with the production system and real 
numbers.
Whomever uses and needs to get these numbers for external reporting will need 
this training.
I am going to schedule a 4 hour session for each class.
If you have any questions, please let me know.
Duane

Cindy,   I need to get a list of the people who are going to need FERC 
training for the ENA group.
GPG has sent me a list of people to train but nothing has been planned or 
confirmed.
I would like to schedule the training for the 3rd week of August after the 
July close.  I am planning to train the view role
from the production data translated by the module for july.  If we can get a 
head count then I can tentatively book
the rooms and equipment to do the training for August.
Thanks
Duane
