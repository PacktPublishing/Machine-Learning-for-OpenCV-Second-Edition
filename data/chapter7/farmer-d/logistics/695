Daren,

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.   Just a reminder for you 
to roll the first six days of December 1999 for 98-9789 Sitara #108246.

Carlos/Tom,

Please apprise when you've completed your research with Producer Services 
referencing the below meters that Daren have referred to as "Contract 
Terminated".

See notes in red below.  In each case where the contract has been terminated, 
Tom and/or Carlos will need to get with Producer Services to determine what 
we need to do (set up a GTC, renegotiate the term deal, etc).

Daren, can you help me with placing K's @ the below listed meters?  I don't 
know if these deals should be rolled or if new ones were set up.

I'll need a K @ each specified meter for the month following the noted month 
that had a K @ it.

Thanks in advance for your help.
