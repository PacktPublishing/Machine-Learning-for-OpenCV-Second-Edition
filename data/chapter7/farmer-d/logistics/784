Joanie,

Logistics is waiting to hear from Daren on this issue.  He will either need 
to extend the deal or maybe there should be another deal in place.   This 
deal 155118 is valid on 1/26/00 only, but the rest of the volume you are 
looking for is scheduled on days 1/27 - 1/31.    I am sure there is no 
pricing on those days.  

I will let you know as soon as I hear from them.
