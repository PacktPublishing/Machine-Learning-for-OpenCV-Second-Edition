This is an outside measured volume that we don't receive volumes on until 
month's end so systematically, no information equals zero. SPI, the software 
vendor for MIPS is investigating all of the rules currently in place for file 
transfers, particularly  0 volumes. The only possible solution is to tag all 
zero volumes sent in the nightly file process as (i) incomplete. I will let 
you know the outcome of this investigation and the monies required to 
complete. We may require a work order to complete based on the outcome of the 
investigation.

Jeff/Gary,
 Where is measurement in the process of sending Pipeline Operations more 
complete data?  We continue to have this problem at various bidirectional 
meters and meter 980071 below is the latest casuality.  When MIPS sends 
Pipeline Operations a zero prelim, this becomes the best available number and 
overlays the estimate that Gas Control sends us.  When this happens & 
scheduling doesn't catch to override the zero, the desk's expense is 
understated. This is causing a huge mess for Texas Operations.  What is the 
plan to move this up on measurements priority list?  We need an answer ASAP!!

Charlotte, 
 At what other meters are we having this problem?

I spoke with Romeo D'Souza this morning regarding the on-going problem of 
MIPS feeding zeros to POPS when incomplete data is received.  

In light of the e-mail below regarding how important it is that we receive 
accurate data from MIPS ....  could you please update me on the status of 
this correction.  

Thank you so much.

Charlotte Hawkins

In reviewing some of the imbalance numbers, I discovered that Valero Texoma 
(#71) BAV volumes have not fed into POPS since 3/14 causing an out of balance 
at the meter in excess of 500,000mm month to date.  The more critical part of 
this problem, however, is that POPS has fed 0 volumes back to Sitara on some 
of the HPLC deals.  This means that these purchase volumes (expenses) have 
not been picked up in Tom's P&L and are, instead, sitting in UA4.  To the 
extent that the purchase prices vary from the UA4 value, the P&L may take a 
hit when these actual volumes flow through.

I realize that Kim is out and that you guys are stretched thin, however, a 
problem of this magnitude needs to be addressed as soon as it's discovered.  
Someone needs to be overriding the 0 volumes so that Sitara is receiving 
correct information and the P&L is kept as accurate as possible.

Please give me a call if you have any questions.
