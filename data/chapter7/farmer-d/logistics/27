Daren, 

Have you had a chance to complete the Texas logistics information for the PowerPoint presentation?   You can just write what you would like me to say in a reply to this email.   I can put the text in the presentation.   I need this info. ASAP so that I can send the presentation to all of the Logistics managers. 

Thanks, 
Elizabeth
