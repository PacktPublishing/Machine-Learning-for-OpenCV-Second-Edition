I received a call from the plant, apparently, they shorted us 60 Dth on the 
3rd of November.  However, someone opened the valve on the 20th and they 
flowed 69 Dth into the pipe without a nomination.  The plant is asking if we 
will phone Tennessee and accept allocation of this volume.  I realize that it 
is really not alot of net difference volumetrically, but, the market has been 
volatile and prices have risen significantly since the Nov. 3rd.  I also 
don't know what the market situation is like on TGPL, would we be creating an 
imbalance on a contract, is there a market to allocate to, are there any 
potential penalties?   I would like to resolve this today, if at all possible.

Please advise.
