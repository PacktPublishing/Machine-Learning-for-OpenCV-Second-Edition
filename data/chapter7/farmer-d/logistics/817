The above referenced meters need to be placed on a K.  Please note the 
information below

98-6736  On 089 for 5/97 (activity @ this meter for 1/97 - 4/97 is on 
078-29165-101) the referenced CPR Deal # is 1567 which ends 4/97.
98-9638  On 089 for 6/97 (activity @ this meter for 1/97 - 11/97 is also on 
089) No referenced CPR Deal #.  The only month that has a K placed on it   is 
12/97 and that is on the 078-30100-103 K.

Thanks for your help.
