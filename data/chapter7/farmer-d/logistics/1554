I am working on clearing an old TXU Lone Star/Gas Distribution balance from 
8/99 and 9/99.  We originally billed TXU on nominated quantities and they 
have shortpaid us due to meter adjustments.  These are brokered deals where 
we sold to TXU and purchased from ExxonMobil and Highland.  TXU has provided 
meter support since the deals were on Lone Star pipeline, however, I am 
unsure how to have Volume Management reallocate.  

For example, we originally sold 10,000 mmbtu on 8/3/99 to TXU and purchased 
1,200 mmbtu from Highland Energy and 8,800 mmbtu from ExxonMobil.  TXU shows 
the total amount of gas on 8/3/99 was 9,240 mmbtu.  How should the purchase 
piece be allocated between ExxonMobil and Highland since this was a brokered 
deal?

August 1999:

Sale
TXU Electric & Gas  deals# 104975, 104256, 104738
Lone Star Gas Co. deal# 101985
Purchase
ExxonMobil Corp. deal#101522
Highland Energy Co. deal#101530

September 1999:

Sale
TXU Electric & Gas deal#109046
Purchase
ExxonMobil Corp. deals#101522, 108564
Highland Energy Co. deals#101530, 108146


Please let me know if I need to speak with someone else about this.  Thanks 
for your help.

Thanks,
Rebecca
