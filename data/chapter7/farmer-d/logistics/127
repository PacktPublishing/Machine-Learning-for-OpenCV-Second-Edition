I'm trying to get this to pull through to Unify for payment to Spinnaker. Volume Management shows "no detail".
Sitara indicated  685 mmbut 4/1-4/30 expected.
Who needs to talk to who to get this fixed.
Payment MUST be set up by noon 5/24/01 for prompt payment to Spinnaker.
Thank you and Please advise.

I received the above allocation for this deal where there is a purchase from Spinnaker and a sale to Dow.  The volumes have not be actualized so there is nothing in Volume Management.  Can one of you look into this and get back to me.

Thanks,

Joyce
