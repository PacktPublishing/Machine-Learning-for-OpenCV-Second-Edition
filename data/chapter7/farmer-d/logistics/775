This is a note to update you guys on the progress I'm making concerning 
cleaning-up and combining well-head deals...  So far, I have completed:

EOG:
Deal 126358 reflects 0 volumes on meter 6067 March 2000 forward
Deal 126281 reflects volumes on meter 6296 as well as volumes moved from 
sitara deal 126358; all volumes are at meter 6296

Forest:
Deal 132832 reflects 0 volumes March 2000 forward
Deal 139397 reflects the combined volumes from both deals on meter 6396

Suemaur:
Deal 138658 reflects 0 volumes March 2000 forward
Deal 138658 reflects the combined volumes from both deals on meter 9766


A similar effort will be made for: Saxet (deals 154608/138546); Comstock 
(deals 125827/125828/125899); and Costilla (deals 125783/125900)
