Daren,

Should I change the counterparty on this sale, or is that handled by 
marketing?  Also, we may need to look at changing the Storage Agmt.   Please 
advise.

Julie,

Cannon is not a wellhead producer.  The meters below are assigned to the 
following individuals:

Meter #  Scheduler

68  Mary Poorman
4132  Jackie Young
1040  Aimee Lannou
1606  Mary Poorman

These schedulers should be advised of the changes.

Bob

The trades below were originally executed between HPL and Cannon Interests 
Houston per terms of a specific Master Physical Agreement.  After recieving 
back executed documentation, we are ready to have the trades offically moved 
within the various Enron capuring systems from Cannon to Kinder Morgan Texas 
Pipeline, Inc. per the terms and conditions of the recently executed Master 
Physical Agreement between HPL and Kinder Morgan Texas Pipeline, Inc.

First, here are the TAG Nos. of the trades we wish to have assigned.

NU2813
NA0376

Second, several trades are listed within a ERMS book called:  P A M
These trades show a 12-31-00 expiry and their Nos. are:

522284
830689
892696
904035
904276

I am not sure what these numbers are.  But, could you move them as well.

Thanks for your help.
