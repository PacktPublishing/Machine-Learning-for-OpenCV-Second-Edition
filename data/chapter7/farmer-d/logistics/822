Carlos, I added a line to these deals to include the 29th of February. I 
wanted to let you, so if you have any questions or need anything let me know.
Bryan



The following deals have end dates of 2/28/00 and likely should be 2/29/00.  
Take a look and change if necessary.

Note:  if a financial deal is associated with the deal it will likely need to 
also be changed.
