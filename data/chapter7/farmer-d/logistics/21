Because the payback was done for October 2001, we can't do it in POPS so we will have to make manual entries to clear the imbalance from the books and show the sale from HPL to ENA.

Rita, 
What time frame do intend to do this in?  I believe this contract is no longer effective after May 31, so if it is in October you will have to reactivate the transport contract so you can book it in POPS.

I talked to Daren and he's going to put a deal in the system for the
sale of the gas from ENA to AEP, so there would be no need for a manual
invoice.
