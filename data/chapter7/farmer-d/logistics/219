Daren I have three meters that have flow in Feb but no deal.

1.  Meter 0416  flowed the whole month  1-28.  This our ols friends at Pawnee gas plant fuel.  Last deal used was 289396 could you extend it.
2. meter 1601 had flow on the 15 &18.  This is Southern union Lockhart.  Last deal used with them was 285350 Hpl or 259208 ENA. 
3. Meter 1598 had flow the whole month 1-28.  This is MT Enterprise C/G- Panther.  The last deal used  is 284 620

I'll get Accounting Arrangements for these when you let me know the deal status and get them cleared up. Thanks.
