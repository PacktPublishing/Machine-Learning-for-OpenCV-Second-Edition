I have an exit interview scheduled for 2pm on Fri. Is there any way we can 
make the interview a little later in the afternoon, so I can have most of the 
afternoon to train my replacement.

Thanks,
Ami

Subject: Ami Chokshi Resigns

Ami has decided to resign from her present position.  Her reason is that she 
wants a change in atmosphere/scenery.  She has decided to pick up and move to 
San Francisco.  She does not a job lined up and Tom Martin has agreed to let 
her stay until Friday, October 20.

Hector, let me and Ami know more about the time/location of the exit 
interviews.  Also, if there is something else you need from me in this 
process, please let me know.

David Baumbach
