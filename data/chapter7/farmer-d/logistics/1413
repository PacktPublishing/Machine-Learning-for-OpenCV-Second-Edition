Daren/Vance - 

The two meters below are new and have unallocatable flow.......I will need a 
purchase for each of them.  Please respond with a deal number, or further 
suggestions for resolution so that I can clear this up as soon as possible.

Hi Guys,

Please take a look at the following meters which are showing up with 
variances on my UA4 report.  Once the variance has been cleared, please send 
me an e-mail.  Please try to clear these within the next couple of days.

Thanks,

Kathy Benedict
