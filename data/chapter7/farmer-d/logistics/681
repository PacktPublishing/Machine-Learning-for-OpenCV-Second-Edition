Hi Daren,
I spoke with Ricky Archer at Calpine about some penalty charges I billed him 
for undertakes on Dec 20, 21, 31.
He said force majeure letters were sent to your attention.

If you have them, would you have someone fax a copy of those letters to met 
at 713-646-8420?

Do you have any other information on the force majure or should I speak with 
Jennifer?

Thanks for your help!
