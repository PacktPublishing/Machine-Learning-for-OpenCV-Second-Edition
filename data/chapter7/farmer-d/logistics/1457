no, it was a GTC Firm.  You will need to create a new deal.

and Oct.

Daren---

I need some help with meter 5892 for September 00 due to a feedback error.  
Deal 133196 (purchase from Duke on gathering contract) is erroring out due to 
it's expiration date of 8/31/00......however it still showed up in POPS (w/o 
a nom) on 9/1.  Volume management allocated volume to it according to the 
allocation statement.  Should this deal be extended?  I noticed it is not out 
there for October either.  I have the feedback error sheet & allocation if 
you want to see them.

Let me know,

Mark

p.s. Fred Boas said you used to handle this and you were very wise in the art 
of allocation......so I am expecting big results Grasshopper!
