Hey gang,

I have created the new deals reflecting the Mid-Texas meters for the 
following deals beginning in January 2000:

ETOCO:   from HPL meter 393  to Mid-Texas meter 9738 
old sitara deal   = 133435
new sitara deal = 163874

Richardson:  from HPL meter 7283 to Mid-Texas meter 9807
old sitara deal   = 141691
new sitara deal = 164003

Mueller:  from HPL meter 7260 to Mid-Texas meter 9769
old sitara deal   =  156247 Feb. 2000 through June 2000
old sitara deal   =  143885 Jan. 2000 only
old sitara deal   =  143887 Jan. 2000 only
new sitara deal  = 164172 


Please take a look at the deals and let me know if I have doubled volumes, or 
if there is anything else I need to do to make things work better...
