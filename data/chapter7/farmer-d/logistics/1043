No deal for March or April 2000................  but I have flow..... in 
March a total of   3804 flowed (delivery) and for April it's averaging about 
100/day as a delivery.   in February this was on the  213 contract, deal 
#83088 as a receipt at this delivery meter.  Do we have a deal at this city 
gate to sell Palacios this gas?


THANKS!!!

Charlotte
