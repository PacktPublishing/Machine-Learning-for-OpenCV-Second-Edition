Subject: Hourly Gas Deals

Here is a high level summary of our discussions last week.  I believe that 
the calculations listed below under option 1 show how HPL would like to 
capture deals and see their postions all based on a 24 hour flow rate basis.  
Option 2 shows what the values would look like under an hourly flow basis.  

Bob:  Please review with the other trading directors and see if they also 
prefer to see everything on a 24 Hour Flow Rate basis.  Thanks!  -  Tommy
