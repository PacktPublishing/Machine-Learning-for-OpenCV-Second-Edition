Daren - 

Per Janet, the price of $5.235 +.05 for deal # 690249 is correct. 
Could you pls change the price in the system to $5.285 for days 25 & 26?

Thanks- Katherine

Janet- 

Per Southern Union's confirmation sheet, the 15,000 mmbtus spot deal on days 03/25 & 3/26 should be priced at  HSC GDP DA +.05 ( at Tuesday, 3/27/01 pricing- which was $ 5.235). Currently, Sitara is showing a price of  HSC GDP +.05.

 Is this Tuesday pricing correct?  If so, pls forward this to Daren so that he can change the price in Sitara to $ 5.235 +.05 ( Totaling $5.285).


Thanks- Katherine
