Listed below are expense contracts that need rates input into Sitara.  Please 
let me know as soon as possible if you are responsible for the input of these 
rates.

Thanks!

Okay!  How about the other expense rates?  If you need any help getting those 
input, let me know.  Otherwise we'll make sure things are clean for that 11th 
workday.  I hope you had a great New Year's!

Rhonda, I took a look at the Missing Service Rates report and I don't have 
the rates to input into the system.  The best I can do is input them if you 
provide them to me.  I am sorry that I can't help more...call me if you need 
to at x1836.

Greg sent me the expense reconciliation reports that have come out were:

Powder River Gathering - Expense
Powder River Gathering - Revenue
East Texas Gathering - Expense
King Ranch Gas Processing - Expense
Humble Gas Pipeline - Expense
Channel Industries - Expense
TGPL - Expense
Black Marlin - Expense

I'm here till noon, and reachable after that at 713-385-7612.  I think that 
Charlotte or someone in the Logistics group can help with these rates.
