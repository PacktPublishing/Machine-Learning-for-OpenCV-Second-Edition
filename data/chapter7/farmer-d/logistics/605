No one resolved this. It still needs to be done. You, Robert, and Volume 
management need to be involved for November. You and Robert can take care of 
Dec. If you need more input let me know.

Thanks
Ken

I was on vacation the week that sent this note out.  I was just wondering if 
anyone helped you resolve this?  And if not do you need help?

In November volume was applied to deal #92963 when, in fact, all volume 
should be on 125066. Please effect this change asap and insure December is 
set up for 125066. Deal #92963 should have been terminated at the end of 
October.

Thanks
Ken
