I combined the tickets for the Southern Union plants at Port Arthur and 
Galveston for April forward to accurately reflect the contract.  The new 
Sitara number is 224490, and the old numbers are: 17832 and109216. This 
change will allow for a more accurate estimate in our P&L as well as more 
accurate invoicing. I believe that this change will reduce our monthly 
variances due to these deals.   If you have any questions or concerns please 
feel free to give me a call
