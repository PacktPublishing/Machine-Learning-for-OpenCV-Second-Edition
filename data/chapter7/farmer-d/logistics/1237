We should sit and discuss the processes involved in creating new, 
unprecedented Product Types in EOL, as I think it is important for you to 
understand the myriad of processes involved. To start with, Legal will 
absolutely need to be involved, as it sounds like a new GTC  is in order.

Please call either Sheri Thomas or I when you are ready to discuss the new 
Product.

Steve - 

One issue that immediately comes to mind is the 'General Terms and  
Conditions' ability to handle intra-day nominations. .This may require a new 
Product Type and GTC. 

Are we presently trading this product OTC, or is this unprecedented?

We are finalizing plans to introduce a new gas products(s) for July.  The 
product(s) would be an hourly product either 5x8 or 5x12 or 5x16.  
Even though we have not decided which product to introduce, I thought I would 
give you a heads up to keep you in the loop.
