Thanks Daren! Was that trade between ENA & AEP or HPLC & AEP?

I only had one day trade with AEP for May.  I bought 5000 at 4.37 on 5/17.
They may have transacted with Kelly Stevens on the Central desk.

   Daren:
   Per conversation with Ryan McGrath @ AEP in Ohio, he & Genaro Mendoza @
   Enron are trying to settle 05/01 gas sales, netout. Per Ryan he is
   missing
   3 sales deals (Sales to AEP by HPL or ENA ),  @ WAHA Hub, that he
   stated,
   per his understanding, Genaro is not reflecting under ENA. The info that
   he
   provided  re: the missing deals are as follows:
      WAHA HUB, 7900 @ $4.18 or   $33,022.00
      WAHA HUB, 7900 @ $4.09 or   $32,311.00
      WAHA HUB, 7900 @ $4.365 or $34,483.50

   I checked with Julie Meyers, (see e-mail below), and she suggested that
   I
   contact you. Can you help with this one? I don't reflect any 05/01 sales
   to
   AEP in Unify.


   Thanks!
