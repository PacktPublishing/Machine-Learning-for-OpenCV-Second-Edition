I am having trouble with 8/00.  The first issue is day 1 of the purchase at 
Fuels Cotton.  We have two deals in Sitara, spot deal 348951 and exchange 
deal 157288.  You had said previously that we would know a spot deal had 
occurred by the new deal ticket and the different pricing.  Since there was a 
spot deal, we put all of the volume for day 1 on deal 348951.  Duke says that 
day 1 was not a spot and that it should be on the exchange deal and priced at 
GD - 0.10.  The exchange deal is currently price at index - 0.05.  Please let 
me know which deal we are suppose to use and what the price should be.  
The second issue is the sale volume on deal 157278 for 8/00.  Duke is telling 
me that we sold them a batch of gas on the 7th, which we see, but that we are 
suppose to prorate the gas over the 5th, 6th, and 7th for the exchange.  This 
is a problem since gas was not confirmed for the 5th and 6th and pipeline 
shows all of the gas on the 7th.  This is a daily swing meter which 
electronically feeds into settlements.  We don't normally change these 
meters.  If you intended for us to prorate this gas, I will need your OK. The 
emails below are from Marta at Duke notifying us of the change.

Read information below and see if this helps one of the unresolved problems
for August.

 Megan can you tell me how you arrived at the price for August 1?  I do not
know why August 1 would be priced differently than the other days of the
month when we had over deliveries for the Fuel Cotton Valley gas.  This is
priced at HSC daily - .10 per paragraph 3 of the contract.  If a different
price was worked out with Darren, I do not have record of it.  Darren is
out until next week.
