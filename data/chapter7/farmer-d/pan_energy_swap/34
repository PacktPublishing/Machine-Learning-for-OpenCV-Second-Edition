Please enter a demand fee on deal 157278 for May 2001 in the amount of $369.69.  We need to bill DEFS for the remaining excess and over delivery charges.

Also, I was going back over my calc sheets and I found an error in Oct 2000.  Please enter a demand fee for $647.35 on deal 157278 for Oct 2000.

Thanks,
Megan
