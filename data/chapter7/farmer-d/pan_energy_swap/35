I have some changes to the DEFS deals for 2001.  We need to add demand fees for the over delivery and excess charges.  I have attached the spreadsheets in case you need them. 
Prod.		Deal		Demand Fee
Feb 2001	157278		$11,903.17
March 2001	157278		$294.85
April 2001	229758		$308.53

   

Thanks,
Megan
