I am trying to forward this money to Tenaska tomorrow, so if you could change 
this before 8:00am tomorrow, I'd appreciate it.

We need to forward the money from the Feb 2001 Brazos sale to Tenaska IV.  I 
am assuming you want to handle this as before by entering a purchase demand 
fee on deal 529856 in the amount of $1,143,484.53.  There is already a demand 
fee for Feb 2001 for $29,851.64, so I think we just need to change that to 
the new amount.  Let me know if you want to handle this differently.

Megan
