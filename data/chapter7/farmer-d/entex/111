Daren,

 In 12/00, Gary Hanks asked me to add an additional nom to meters 3509 & 3533 
to make it total 2500.  I asked you about it and you said that you would 
probably have to increase the Reliant Energy-Entex nom (Deal 292249).  In the 
meantime I added the additional volume to strangers gas so that gas control 
could see a 2500 nom.  I have been allocating all the gas to Reliant for 
12/00.  For 1/01, do you want to increase those noms?  Let me know.
