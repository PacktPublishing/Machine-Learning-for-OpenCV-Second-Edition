Liz--Please make a note that I added meter #1168 Midcon/Bammel to the Entex 
deal #318052 for January 1st & 2nd for flow that occured. 

I pathed a 1 to come across to POPS, but the following will be allocated to 
the deal:

1st: 2,953
2nd 549
Total 3,502  (actual flow volume)

Patsy with Midcon(KinderMorgan) is aware of this and agrees.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Mark
