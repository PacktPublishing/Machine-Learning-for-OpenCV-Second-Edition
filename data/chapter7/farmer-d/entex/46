The following represents daily volume and price information for Entex's first 
contract year. The citygate volumes were retreived out of Business Objects 
and represent Entex's meter 2000 volumes. The Midcon volumes are based on 
daily nominated (not allocated) volumes. The customer price represents a 
weighted average of Entex total billed volume (industrial and residential) 
against the dollar amount billed to them. I've put together charts that graph 
the following:
 1. Entex's total volume (Citygate and Midcon) v. Daily price
 2. Midcon volumes v. Daily price
 3. Daily price v. Customer price
 4.  First of the month Index v. Gas Daily Price
 5. Percent change in daily price v. Percent change in daily volume



Thanks,
Ami
