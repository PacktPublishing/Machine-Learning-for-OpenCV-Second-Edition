Folks,

You've probably already read that listbot is dying as of August 6.

So, I've created a transition list on another service. To send messages to
the list, please start using the following e-mail address:

	brcc.yf@topica.com

I plan on closing the old list (bammelyoundfamilies@listbot.com) as of
Friday, August 13.

If you are still interested in participating in the "Bammel Young Families"
list, please send an e-mail to "brcc.yf-subscribe@topica.com".

If you think you'll want to check the past messages, or to create your own
lists in the future, use the following steps:

1. Go to http://www.topica.com/lists/brcc.yf

2. On the right hand side of the page, type in your e-mail address under
"Not a Topica Member yet"

3. Click "Continue"

4. Fill in the registration, then click the "I agree" button

5. You'll next see a page with text like "Thanks, Ram! You're almost done."

6. Scroll to the end of this page, and click the "continue" button.

7. A dialog will pop-up, asking whether you want to "tap into exclusive...
blah, blah, blah". Just click Cancel.

Once you join the new list, please drop me an e-mail to
"rtackett@abacustech.net". I'll then delete you from the old so that you
won't get duplicate messages from both lists.

The messages on the new list will be available to members online at:

	http://www.topica.com/lists/brcc.yf

One nice feature of topica is the ability to put messages on "Vacation
Hold", so that we don't end up with auto-responder problems. For more info
on "vacation hold", go to http://topica.com/# and then click on the
"vacation hold" link under "subscriber services".


Thanks,
