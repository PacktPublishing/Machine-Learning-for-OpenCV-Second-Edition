 I needed to read this in light of yesterday's events.....

TRIBUTE TO THE UNITED STATES
 This, from a Canadian newspaper, is worth sharing.

America: The Good Neighbor.
 Widespread but only partial news coverage was given
 recently to a remarkable editorial broadcast from
 Toronto by Gordon Sinclair, a Canadian television
 Commentator. What follows is the full text of his
 trenchant remarks as printed in the Congressional
 Record:


 "This Canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the
 Americans as the most generous and possibly the
 least appreciated people on all the earth. Germany,
 Japan and, to a lesser extent, Britain and Italy
 were lifted out of the debris of war by the
 Americans who poured in billions of dollars and
 forgave other billions in debts.

 None of these countries is today paying even the
 interest on its remaining debts to the United
 States. When France was in danger of collapsing in
 1956, it was the Americans who propped it up, and
 their reward was to be insulted and swindled on the
 streets of Paris. I was there. I saw it.

 When earthquakes hit distant cities, it is the
 United States that hurries in to help. This spring,
 59 American communities were flattened by tornadoes.
 Nobody helped. The Marshall Plan and the Truman
 Policy pumped billions of dollars into discouraged
 countries. Now newspapers in those countries are
 writing about the decadent, warmongering Americans.

 I'd like to see just one of those countries that is
 gloating over the erosion of the United States
 dollar build its own airplane. Does any other
 country in the world have a plane to equal the
 Boeing Jumbo Jet, the Lockheed Tri-Star, or the
 Douglas DC10?

 If so, why don't they fly them? Why do all the
 International lines except Russia fly American
 Planes? Why does no other land on earth even
 consider putting a man or woman on the moon? You
 talk about Japanese technocracy, and you get radios.
 You talk about German technocracy, and you get
 automobiles. You talk about American technocracy,
 and you find men on the moon - not once, but several
 times - and safely home again.

 You talk about scandals, and the Americans put
 theirs right in the store window for everybody to
 look at. Even their draft-dodgers are not pursued
 and hounded. They are here on our streets, and most
 of them, unless they are breaking Canadian laws, are
 getting American dollars from ma and pa at home to
 spend here.

 When the railways of France, Germany and India were
 breaking down through age, it was the Americans who
 rebuilt them. When the Pennsylvania Railroad and the
 New York Central went broke, nobody loaned them an
 old caboose. Both are still broke.

 I can name you 5000 times when the Americans raced
 to the help of other people in trouble. Can you name
 me even one time when someone else raced to the
 Americans in trouble? I don't think there was
 outside help even during the San Francisco
 earthquake.


 Our neighbors have faced it alone, and I'm one
 Canadian who is damned tired of hearing them get
 kicked around. They will come out of this thing
 with their flag high. And when they do, they are
 entitled to thumb their nose at the lands that are
 gloating over their present troubles. I hope Canada
 is not one of those."

 Stand proud, America! Wear it proudly!!

***************************************************************
This is one of the best editorials that I have ever
 read regarding the United States. It is nice that
 one man realizes it. I only wish that the rest of
 the world would realize it. We are always blamed for
 everything, and never even get a thank you for the
 things we do.

 I would hope that each of you would send this to as
 many people as you can and emphasize that they
 should send it to as many of their friends until
 this letter is sent to every person on the web. I am
 just a single American that has read this, TRIBUTE TO
 THE UNITED STATES
