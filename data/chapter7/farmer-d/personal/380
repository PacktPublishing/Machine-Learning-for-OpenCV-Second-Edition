Hi Bubba!

Lacy got her eye exam yesterday.  He said that she is very near sighted, but 
the diabetes has not affected her eyes at all.  That was a relief. She's been 
having headaches, so I was concerned. They probably have been from her blood 
sugars being out of control.  She is doing so much better now.  I have 
stopped waking her up to check it in the night & the levels are so much 
better. She's acting a lot more like her old self now. A lot nicer to me.  I 
guess her sugars out of control & all the stress of Tiger Dolls was what was 
wrong with her.  She doesn't say the cruel things to me that she used to.  I 
knew something had to be wrong with her.  I thought surely I had not raised a 
child with such a mean spirit.  Anyway things are a lot better.

Tell Cole that Mimi hopes his eye appointment goes as well as Lacy's.  Let 
him call to tell me about it.  I hope he gets his teary eye "fixed".
Lacy's eye doctor talked more about her teeth almost than he did her eyes.  
He couldn't believe her teeth are so perfect without braces. And she is so 
tanned, you can see her a mile away with those white teeth shining when she 
smiles.  She has a dentist appointment for cleaning at the first part of next 
week.  We'll talk later about when we are coming to your house.I'm going to 
Longview to a singles retreat Sat.in case you call & I'm not there.  Will be 
home Sat. night. Love ya, Maw
