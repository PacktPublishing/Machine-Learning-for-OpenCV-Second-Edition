Remember Me?  I'm the one who loved you so much that I gave my very best at
raising you. And now I'm missing you so much. Lacy & I can't  understand why
you don't call to check on us & just to talk a while--it doesn't count that
Tonya calls--I didn't raise her.We want to hear your voice every once in a
while.  I know you work a lot, but you used to find time once a week.And
that's no excuse. You can schedule in a call to us.  We're still your family
too.  We love you, Ma
