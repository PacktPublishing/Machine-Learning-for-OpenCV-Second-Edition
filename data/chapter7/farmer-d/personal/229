Hey!  What did the doctor say about Jake?  Did they run the tests?  I'm out
next week Wed.-Fri. for spring break.  I want to bring Lacy to see Jake.
When would be best?  Tonya said the weekends were taken for a while.Did she
mean Easter Weekend too?  Hope Jake is doing better. You never did send me
any videos of him & Cole so I could see if I could download them.  Love, Ma
