	There is no way to undermine the devastation and loss we've all
witnessed and felt over the last couple of weeks, but when you look at the
following numbers and realize how much worse it could've been, I guess there
are a lot of people who were saved. . .




			Subject: The odds are against them

			By now everyone has been hearing the death toll rise
and reports of the
			destruction from the terrorist attacks on the US.
These were deplorable
			acts
			that we will never forget. But now is a time to look
at the other side of
			the
			numbers coming out of New York, Washington and
Pennsylvania. The sad
			but somewhat uplifting side that the mainstream
media has not reported yet
			  - the SURVIVAL rates and some positive news about
the attacks.

			*** The Buildings ***

			* The World Trade Center -
			The twin towers of the World Trade Center were
places of employment for
			some
			50,000 people. With the missing list of just over
5,000 people, that means
			90% of the people targeted survived the attack. A
90% on a test is an 'A'.

			* The Pentagon -
			Some 23,000 people were the target of a third plane
aimed at the Pentagon.
			The latest count shows that only 123 lost their
lives. That is an amazing
			99.5% survival rate. in addition, the plane seems to
have come in too low,
			too early to affect a large portion of the building.
On top of that, the
			section that was hit was the first of five sections
to undergo renovations
			that would help protect the Pentagon from terrorist
attacks. It had
			recently
			completed straightening and blastproofing, saving
untold lives. This attack
			was sad, but a statistical failure.

			*** The Planes ***

			* American Airlines Flight 77
			This Boeing 757 that was flown into the outside of
the Pentagon could have
			carried up to 289 people, yet only 64 were aboard.
Luckily 78% of the seats
			were empty.

			* American Airlines Flight 11
			This Boeing 767 could have had up to 351 people
aboard, but only carried
			92.
			Thankfully 74% of the seats were unfilled.

			* United Airlines Flight 175
			Another Boeing 767 that could have sat 351 people
only had 65 people on
			board. Fortunately it was 81% empty.

			* United Airlines Flight 93
			This Boeing 757 was one of the most uplifting
stories yet. The smallest
			flight to be hijacked with only 45 people aboard out
of a possible 289 had
			84% of its capacity unused. Yet these people stood
up to the attackers and
			thwarted a fourth attempted destruction of a
national landmark, saving
			untold numbers of lives in the process.

			*** In Summary ***
			Out of potentially 74,280 Americans directly
targeted by these inept
			cowards, 93% survived or avoided the attacks. That's
a higher survival rate
			than heart attacks, breast cancer, kidney
transplants and liver transplants
			- all common, survivable illnesses.

			The Hijacked planes were mostly empty, the Pentagon
was hit at it's
			strongest point, the overwhelming majority of people
in the World Trade
			Center buildings escaped, and a handful of
passengers gave the ultimate
			sacrifice to save even more lives.

			Pass this information on to those in fear and the
media. Don't fear these
			terrorists. The odds are against them.
