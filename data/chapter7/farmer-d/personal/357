Dear Jerry,

Thank you for requesting more information from Quicken Loans through our

I made an initial attempt to contact you to gather the additional information 
required to process your application but have not been able to get through.  
Please reply to this message with the best time to call and the phone number 
you would like me to use.

If it is more convenient, you can also call me direct at 800.226.6308  Ext.

8:00 am - 7:00 pm and Saturday, 10:00 am - 4:00 pm (all times Eastern).  If I 
am not available, one of the other loan consultants on my team will be happy 
to assist you.

Interest rates change daily.  For the latest rates on our many programs you
