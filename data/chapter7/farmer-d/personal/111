A friend of mine that I've known since college at Harding is looking for a
job in IT or consulting.

His last stint was as a Senior Systems Engineer in Compaq's SAP Solutions
Center.

He's a stellar guy, and very smart, as you can tell from his resume.

If you know of any opportunities, please pass this along.

Thanks,

Ram Tackett
