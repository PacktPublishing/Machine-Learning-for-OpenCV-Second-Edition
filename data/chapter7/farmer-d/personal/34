Is "not going to AEP" considered an accomplishment?  By the way, most of the people who could give performance feedback on me are leaving or have left the company.  I'm sure they thought that I was superior though.

It's that time again.

Please put together a list of accomplishments for the first six months.

I know you can use the system some how, just not sure how.

Let me know.
