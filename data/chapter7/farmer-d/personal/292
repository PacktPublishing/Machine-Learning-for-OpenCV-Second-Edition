I am hooked. Name the time and place to  meet......................
?
Tell Ami good luck for me.

Who would have thunk OU would be back so quickly. Now we have  to contend 
with them, K-State, and the conference championship (if we survive).  I don't 
see the Big 12 being #1 if we don't lighten up on each  other.

You want a chuckle----- My daughter is a big NU fan and has  gone to a couple 
of Baylor games.?Says it's not quite the same as Lincoln;  but the 
expectations are not high.
?
Let me know on lunch and I'll be there.
