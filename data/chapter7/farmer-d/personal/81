"...if my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and
 pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear
 from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land." - 2
 Chronicles 7:14

 Bryant Gumbel recently interviewed Billy Graham's daughter.

 Gumbel: "Why didn't God stop this or do something about this?"

 Billy Graham's daughter: "For years we have told God we didn't want
 Him in our schools. We didn't want Him in our government and we
 didn't want Him in our finances and God was being a perfect gentleman in
 doing just what we asked Him to do. We need to make up our mind - do
 we want God or do we not want Him. We cannot just ask Him in when
 disaster strikes."

 Bryant Gumbel was silent.
