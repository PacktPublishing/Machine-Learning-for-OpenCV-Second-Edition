I believe the boat is 18 to 19 ft long and I do have a boat cover.  I will bring the boat information with me tomorrow for anymore questions.  I recently took it to the shop to get it ready for this season and the salesman said it looked brand new.  It has a brand new battery and everything runs perfectly.  Call me if you want to take a look at it.
