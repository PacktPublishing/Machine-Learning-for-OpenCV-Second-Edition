Great idea, Byron!

Everybody,

I've created a new moderated list at http://BammelYoungFamilies.listbot.com=
/

If you are interested in hearing info (from anyone, not just me) about the
Bammel Road Young Families class, please go to the address above to
subscribe to the list.

It's free.

Then, if you have anything that you want to share with the class, just
e-mail it to BammelYoungFamilies@listbot.com.

-Ram.

What do you think about creating and maintaining an e mail address that wil=
l
automatically send an e mail to everyone in our class?  That way anyone tha=
t
wanted to blanket the class could always do so without going through you al=
l
the time.
