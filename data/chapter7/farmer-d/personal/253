Hi,
?
How is the family???? and the multiple jobs??????
?
We just got back from Omaha --- Linda's 40th High School  reunion. I wish 
someone would explain to me who all those old people were that  attended.
?
Putting $1.85 a gallon gas in that beast of hers was sure fun.  I may need a 
part-time job if this keeps up long. (Just kidding -- you probably  have 
enough to deal with -- right)
?
Jennifer has decided to journey off to Law school at Baylor.  She and Linda 
are going to Waco Friday to finalize an apartment. 
Chris is managing the I-10 Texas Land & Cattle store.  Keeps him very busy. 
(can't even send an e-mail ----- like someone else I know)  (Just kidding)
?
We are looking for property on a lake (Linda's request). Like  there is 
anything like that left in Texas. We will probably drop in this  house.
?
Pretty quiet here all things considered.
?
Drop me a line or give me a call when you have some time. Or  if you are 
really free we could actually plan a lunch. The price of natural gas  should 
help keep Tom from hassling you too much.
?
Ken
