Hello Team,

I'm going to get the forms for the Baskeball association today for everyone 
to fill out.  The fees are going to be $10 for the association and $10 for 
the leauge entry fee. The YMCA will provide jerseys for each game or we can 
buy our own. Let me know what you want to do. The games start next Wednesday, 
I should have a schedule pretty soon. 

B
