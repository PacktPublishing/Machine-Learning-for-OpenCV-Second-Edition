I had computer problems today, which snarf'd all the addresses that I have
previous e-mailed you folks. None of those previous http address are valid
any more.

So, look to http://24.27.98.30/pictures/index.htm to find a table of
contents of July pictures. I'll try to keep this updated, as new pictures
are posted.

Thanks,
