What's up team? Our game this week is as 6:00. Let me know who is going to be 
there. I would assume everyone will just leave and come back to run you 
books. The jersey's will be done and I will have them for you. They cost 
$25.00, so try and bring the cash Wed. Our shirts are black with red numbers, 
everyone please try and wear black shorts so if we play like shit we'll at 
least look good.

Bryan
