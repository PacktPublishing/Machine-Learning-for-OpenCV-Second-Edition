Hi, Just wanted to let you know that Lacy's sugar levels are staying up 
pretty well.  She was down to 51 this morning, but she took a shot last night 
& I guess she didn't eat enough ice cream.  She was mad at me cause I didn't 
give her more than I did.  But it's so hard to know exactly how to handle it 
'cause she's been going to bed a little high & getting up a little high.  But 
anyway, she's doing better & I guess she'll always be mad & think I'm 
mistreating her.  I stay stressed out every day not knowing if she got low 
after I left & passed out & no one would know it.  I'm going to try to get a 
cell phone & have her call me when she gets there--I think--I don't 
know--she'll be mad about that too.  But the other night, she didn't eat 
right after she took her shot, then didn't eat anything fast acting & got in 
the truck to go over to Phillip's to get research info from his computer, got 
low & had to pull over & eat sugar tabs.  So that's what scares me.  She knew 
to eat righ!
t after she took that shot & didn't. But she was high before she took it & I 
guess she didn't think about it getting low. I don't know what will happen to 
her when she leaves home.

But anyway, I wanted to let you know that we're going to Dallas to look for 
the prom dress & shoes, don't know if we will stay all night or not. I 
haven't talked to Shane & Shelley.  I wanted to stay & go to Saturn Rd. to 
church & go to the singles class.  But I don't know what Shane & Shelley have 
planned.  So we'll be back either Sat. night or Sun. Lacy has to be back to 
work on 3 research papers & projects that are all due at once.  So, wish us 
luck.  Any donations will be appreciated!  I hear they're more than I was 
expecting. But anyway, I don't intend to go overboard.  Maybe there will be 
some sales.
Hope my grandsons are doing ok.  I bet they were glad that their Daddy got 
back home Sunday. Hug them for me & tell Cole that Mimi can't wait to see his 
bunkbeds. Love ya'll
