Hey!  Guess it was hard to get back, huh!  I was going to get Jake one of
those baby wipe warmers and send it with Art & Jo, but Walmart was out of
them. Maybe I need to get something else.  Do you have one of those toys
that goes on the bar of the carrier?  Is Jake ok? Let me hear from you,
please.  I'm making Lacy stay off the phone from 7-9:30 every night so that
you & Shane can have a chance to call if you want to.  I sure do miss
holding Jake and playing with Cole.  Cole is so funny.  I've been telling
everybody things that he does & they can't believe it at 2 yrs. old.  I
gotta get busy--let me know if you get this.  I know you're busy, just a
little answer to let me know 'cause I sent you one a while back that you
never answered and the last 2 that I sent Shane & Shelly they didn't get.
Love ya, Ma
