On Saturday, May 13th, beginning at 9:00 a.m., The Enron Basketball

first eight teams that reply.  While we encourage you to form your own teams, 
please let us know if you do not have enough players and we will make sure

Tuesday, May 9th, to discuss the rules, prizes, and other details related to 
the tournament preparation.  Please have a representative from your team come 
to this meeting prepared with rosters, a team name, and shirt sizes.  Lunch 
will be provided.

If you are interested in placing a team in the tournament, or enter as an
