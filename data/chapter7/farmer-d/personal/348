Here's a video of the three and four year old kids singing at the Christmas
program at church last year.

It's about a minute and half in length.

Hunter drowns out the other kids with his monotonal singing.

He's holding a staff and is dressed as a shepherd with a black headband on
the row below the back row angels.
