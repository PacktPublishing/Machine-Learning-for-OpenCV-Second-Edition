HEY! Tonya said to staple copy B of the W-2 to the tax return--But on the
one from camp it says Copy C for payer or State Copy, Copy B for Recipient
(Keep for your records).  So which one do I send?  The one from the school
says send B but I'm confused on the other one.
What did the doctor say about Tonya & the due date? Love, Ma
