Please talk up the Senior High Night Out this  Wednesday.??It is this Friday 
night from 9:30pm-2:30 am, with bowling,  broomball, and other stuff!? The 
cost is $20.
?
Even though the kids will have their own events  before and after broomball, 
they will be expecting their?NEON leaders for  the broomball portion of the 
evening. We need to show up at the Aerodrome  shortly after 11:00, and we'll 
have the ice from 11:15-12:15.??After  that we'll go home and the kids will 
go on to other stuff till 2:30!  
?
See you at the Aerodrome.
?
Bobby
