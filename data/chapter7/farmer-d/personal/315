i am doing well. i just got out here, and am getting
adjusted. trying to meet new folks everyday, even if
it is at the corner coffee shop. i do feel free, and
haven't thought about entex. my friends have been
welcoming. i have a couple of friend out here that
have a winter house in tahoe, and they have invited me
to jon them for thanksgiving in tahoe. i'll probably
ski a little, but i'm just looking forward to curling
up to a book by the fireplace. i ope you are doing
well. i miss you guys. keep in touch...
