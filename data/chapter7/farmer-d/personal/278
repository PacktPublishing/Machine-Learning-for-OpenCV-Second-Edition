Dear Daren Farmer,

One of the things we like to do here at Expedia is help you
maximize your vacation dollar. Since accommodations are a
big part of every vacation, we went to more than 1,200 quality
hotels in more than 240 cities and negotiated hotel rates up to
70% less than the average standard rates. We call these Expedia
Special Rates, and it's all about saving you money. When you
search for a hotel on Expedia.com, just look for the "Expedia
Special Rates" icon and you'll know you're getting this special rate.

Right now, you can take advantage of an Expedia Special Rate
at the brand-new Aladdin Resort in Las Vegas. This spectacular
hotel just opened, and it features one of the largest collections of
shopping, dining, entertainment, and gaming options available in
Las Vegas. See what it's all about:

D.C. art show makes an "impression"
What do you mean your kids don't understand van Gogh,
Matisse, Cezanne? Well, now's their chance to see these
classics as more than just weird blobs of color, thanks to an
art museum in Washington, D.C. that will help your kids get
hip to impressionism.

Transport yourself to China from Portland
Stroll past stone lions and walls of greenery in a Suzhou-style
garden, which is the largest of its kind outside of China. As you
pass through the moongates of this Oregon Chinese garden,
you'll feel as if you've been transported to China.

We've designed Fare Tracker to help you find great fares by listing
the lowest round trip fares found by your fellow travelers on the routes

We have made it easier to find the lowest fares that we
send to you in the Faretracker mail by sending you the lowest
fares found by other Expedia customers.  Unfortunately,
we are unable to track fares for all possible airport pairs
in the world.  All three airport pairs that you have in your
Faretracker subscription are no longer supported.  Please click

Blue Nile Travel Advisory: Protect Your New Wedding Rings
****************************************************************

Ensure your wedding rings return from the honeymoon:

* Make sure the rings fit snugly, so they're not lost during outdoor
activities.
* Insure your rings before you go. Check to see that your insurance
policy
covers lost and stolen items around the world.
* If you have to take your wedding rings off, put them in the hotel
safe.

For education and guidance in selecting the perfect diamond, or for a
gift
of jewelry to remind you of your trip for years to come, visit Blue
Nile.
