Any word yet?  I don't mean to rush you, but Tenaska IV is being very 
persistent.

That sounds great.  Because of the accrual, I cannot draft this today.  I 
will try it on Monday.  What about the demand fee for the payable to Tenaska 
IV.  Do you think that is a good idea?  I explained it to Kris Hanson and she 
agreed that it was the best way to book this payable.  We would need a new 
demand purchase ticket for Tenaska IV on the Cleburne desk in the amount of 
$2,803,586.41 with no volume and no commodity.  This is more than we owe 
Tenaska IV, but I will net it with the Tenaska IV sale and the $0.04 demand 
fee to pay a net amount of $1,551,050.76.  I have attached my spreadsheet 
which details our payment.  We will have to adjust this number once we get 
the actual volumes.  I would like to pay Tenaska IV next week, so please let 
me what you think.



Thanks,
Megan
