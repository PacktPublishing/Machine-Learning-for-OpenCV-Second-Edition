Please note that the Cleburne plant is expected to come back up on Sat. 
morning the 7th of October.  I have already submitted the nominations to 
Lonestar for the weekend (7th-9th), taking all gas to the plant.  If they 
come up early, we have imbalance gas that will serve them.   I have informed 
Mary of this, and will give her a copy of the noms, #'s and contacts, etc....


Thanks,
Mark

We are finally beginning to put closure on our outage. It has been
frustrating to say the least. We are currently projecting a late Friday or
early Saturday morning startup barring any unseen problems.
