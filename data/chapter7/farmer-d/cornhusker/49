The invoices are being paid by us now....James Armstrong is taking care of 
them, so that is who I am forwarding them to.  He apparently is paying for 
them of an account set up for this.  He is out of the office, but he called 
me back and said to keep forwarding him the invoices.

Let me know if we have any questions,

Thanks,
Mark
