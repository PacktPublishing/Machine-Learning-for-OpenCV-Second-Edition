Can you shed a little light on this Tenaska IV deal?  James Armstrong is 
telling me that we should have a purchase deal in the system to pay Tenaska 
IV for the 9/00 and 10/00 gas that we are marketing for them.  I do not see a 
deal in Path Manager for either month.  I also need some detail on who we are 
buying and selling this gas from and to.  There are a number of 
counterparties at Lonestar for ENA and I'm not sure which ones go with this 
deal.  Is there a schedule you can email to me?  James is looking for an 
answer today on the Tenaska IV payment, so whatever you can tell me will be 
appreciated.

Thanks,
Megan
