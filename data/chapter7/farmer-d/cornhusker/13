Thanks for the information below.  Sometime next week, would you go ahead and 
make a copy of the contract brief for me.  You can interoffice mail it to me

Thanks,

Kathy Benedict

If you need it, I've got a contract brief that lists the transport cost and 
fuel from each location (there numerous receipt points).  It is possible that 
we may need to purchase extra gas for the plant on occasion.  In that case, 
we can use the same transport contract on Lone Star and transport on other 
pipes also.  Any expense we incur to deliver gas to the plant will be passed 
on to the plant.

If you have any questions, let me know.

Kathy-----Here is what I know about Cornhusker:

Our supply comes from Apache & Williams

Our market typicially is the plant (Tenaska IV Partners)
If the plant is down, Brazos Utility has the right to the gas if they want it
If Brazos does not call for the gas, then we will sell off to whomever we can

We just get a flat fee on this gas per MMBtu, whether it goes to the plant or 
not

Daren Farmer knows the specifics about the deal

Hope this helps, call with any questions.
