Daren---(Re: the email below from Kathy Benedict)  If I'm not mistaken, I 
thought we didnt take end up taking over Cornhusker completely until 
October?  I thought Tenaska was still doing it, at least accounting for it.  
Therefore, this gas wasn't pathed during the month...and I believe we didnt 
have all the tickets in at the time.  What do you recall?

Thanks,
Mark

Hi Guys,

Please do me and Bob Fisher in the Transport Settlements group a huge 
favor......Please let us know when the TXU/Lonestar  transport deals for 
Tenaska IV Texas Partners have been entered into Path Manager (for September 
2000).

I am holding the transport invoice from TXU/Lonestar for September 
2000....waiting to enter the "actuals" into our system for payment.

Thanks,

Kathy  :  )
