Hey Ami,  We have a little issue on Transco regarding Devon production.  Does 
your contact @ Devon know if we are responsible for scheduling  PVR for them. 
Please read note below and let me know if we need to talk to anyone on our 
side.  THANKS!

FYI,

Transco has called wanting to know who is responsible for nominating Devon's 
PVR.  We do not have access to their contracts to do 
the noms.  CES use to have Transco do it for them and so did we for January 
and February, but nothing was nominated for March or April.  I
mentioned this to Nelson and Dan Junek back in March, but nothing was 
decided.  At one time, Devon did not want to give us access to nominate
their PVR because they did not want us to have access to any of their 
information.  Could you find out if we are responsible for the PVR and if we 
are, they
have to make us agent to nominate on those particular contracts?  Maybe you 
will have better luck than I did.

Thanks,
Bev
