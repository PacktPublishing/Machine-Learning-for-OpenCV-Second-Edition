Megan: All price changes regarding CES Texas should be filtered through me 
and/or the Texas Economics desk (Bryan Hull or O'Neal Winfree). 

O'Neal/Bryan:  Can we look into these co-owner deals to ensure accurate 
pricing and risk assignment?

Thanks,
Ami

Megan:  Done

Ami:  You might want to have a look at the CES deals.  Here is another one 
where the price is not right.

Bryan:  I have only changed January and February.  Please look at the future 
months and change them.

Thanks!!

Julie

I think the price needs to be changed on deal 141977 for CES-Hunt Petroleum.  
It should be HSC - 0.10.  I need this ASAP.

Thanks,
Megan
