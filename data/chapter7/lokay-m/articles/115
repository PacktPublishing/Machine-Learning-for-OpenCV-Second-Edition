Edison Mission Energy to build power plant in California

Edison Mission Energy, an Edison International company, is purchasing the
rights to the Sunrise Power Project from Texaco Power and Gasification. A
proposed power generation facility to be located in Kern County, Calif., the
project will bring both short- and long-term generation capacity to the
state, which is in dire need of new power generation.

The Sunrise Power Project will be completed in two phases. Phase 1 will
consist of a 320-MW, simple-cycle peaking facility scheduled to be in
service during the summer of 2001. Phase 2 will convert the peaking facility
to a 560-MW, combined-cycle operation with an in-service date of summer
2003.

Final regulatory approvals should be received shortly for Phase I of the
project. Edison Mission Energy plans to seek expedited permitting approval
for the Phase II expansion in line with the fast-track approvals process
recently enacted by the California legislature.

Edison Mission Energy specializes in the development, acquisition,
construction management and operation of global power production facilities.
The company owns nearly 23,000 MW of generating capacity, including
interests in 75 projects currently under construction or operating in
Australia, Indonesia, Italy, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, Spain, Thailand,
Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States.
