*********************************************************Cooler temperature=
s=20
and lower energy demand in the West have driven daily power prices below $1=
00=20
per megawatt hour (MWh). The summer brought the region's strongest sustaine=
d=20
power and gas markets in recent history. For fall and winter, CERA expects=

western spot power and gas prices to be higher and more volatile than in pa=
st=20
years, with October on-peak power prices at $114=01)$143 per MWh and winter=
=20
prices around $74=01)$92 per MWh, depending on location. August's El Paso=

pipeline explosion intensified the summer's supply bottlenecks. Although=20
service on the Southern system was quickly restored, the supply disruption=
=20
affected storage inventories, with a heavy summer draw in California=20
weakening already dwindling inventories. For two weeks, pipeline capacity=

limits on El Paso's pipe into California pushed Topock differentials to=20
nearly $2.00 per MMBtu, and the access constraint intensified downward=20
pressure on Rocky Mountain!
 and San Juan prices. The Topock differential fell back last week after=20
averaging over $1.00 per MMBtu for most of September. The rush to inject=20
storage inventories ahead of heating season should limit further declines i=

that differential.
