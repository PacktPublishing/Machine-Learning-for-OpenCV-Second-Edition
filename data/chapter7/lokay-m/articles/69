PG&E Corp. announced that its National Energy Group will develop its first 
Nevada project, a 1,000 MW natural gas-fired generating plant to be located 
45 miles northeast of Las Vegas. The merchant plant's main purpose is to 
supply Nevada, but when it is not needed there, it will add much-needed 
supply to the western energy market. The group hopes to begin construction 
during the fourth quarter of 2001, with completion expected in early 2004. 
"Southern Nevada has one of the most rapidly growing economies in the 
country," said Thomas B. King, president of PG&E NEG, West Region. "Because 
of its location near Las Vegas, the Meadow Valley project will be ideally 
positioned to efficiently serve that demand growth." Including the Nevada 
project, PG&E National Energy Group has a total of 4,000 MW in development or 
construction in California, Oregon, Nevada and Arizona.
