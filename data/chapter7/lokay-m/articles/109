Kern River discovered a mechanical problem with an oil seal at the Fillmore 
Compressor Station in Utah. Fillmore will be inoperable while repairs are 
made Nov. 30, but no impact to firm capacity is expected. However, 
interruptible capacity will be reduced as necessary for the Nov. 28-29 gas 
days and will not be available Nov. 30.

Northwest noted that despite putting its system into entitlement and issuing 
a realignment OFO, primary scheduled volumes through Kemmerer (WY) Station 
remain greater than physical capacity. Therefore, starting today the pipeline 
is invoking a "must-flow OFO" provision of its tariff. Until further notice, 
shippers with primary corridor rights southbound through Kemmerer are 
required to flow up to 10% of their contract demand from receipt points north 
of Kemmerer to delivery points south of Kemmerer or take some other mutually 
agreeable action to alleviate the Kemmerer capacity problem. See the 
Northwest bulletin board for details.
