Subject:=09El Paso Had Market Power



In a release from Natural Gas Intelligence according to FERC staff counsel,=
 El Paso Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant Energy possessed market power dur=
ing the summer of 2000 and violated FERC's marketing affiliate standards. T=
he article states that El Paso had market power after May 2000 for at least=
 two months when pipeline capacity constraints created a separate relevant =
geographic market in California. The evidence pointed to the now-infamous F=
ebruary 7 and 9, 2000 telephone conversations showing that the operating em=
ployees of El Paso Merchant, El Paso Natural Gas and Mojave Pipeline "were =
not functioning independently," according to staff counsel.=20

The phone conversations took place just days before El Paso pipeline began =
its open season for 1.22 Bcf/d of firm, capacity on its system (bound for C=
alifornia), all awarded to El Paso Merchant.

Before and during the open season, EPME gained new information about the re=
structured long-term tiered discount on Mojave to Wheeler Ridge while poten=
tial non-affiliate shippers were not according to counsel. As a result, cou=
nsel find that EPME's group had an undue competitive advantage with the new=
 Mojave discount generating a successful bid for the El Paso pipeline capac=
ity.=20

FERC Chief ALJ Wagner is expected to issue an initial decision in early Oct=
ober.
