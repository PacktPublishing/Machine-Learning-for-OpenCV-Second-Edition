Title: California's Desperate Attempts to Avoid a Rate Increase
URL: http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=3D35&m=3D2241


California=01,s Desperate Attempts to Avoid a Rate Increase

On February 1, 2001, the California Assembly approved and the California
governor signed a new law intended to secure power supplies for California.=
=20
The
legislature has been meeting since early January in a =01&special extraordi=
nary
session=018 to address the power market crisis in the state, and the new la=
w
represents their first significant piece of legislation. The bill, AB 1,
establishes a new mechanism for purchasing power for the state=01,s busines=
ses=20
and
consumers. Whether the mechanism works will depend chiefly on whether the
limited revenue source used to pay for the power=01*collected by the state=
=01,s
investor-owned utilities (IOUs) under current retail rates=01*will cover=20
wholesale
power market costs incurred by the state. The law reflects the obsession by
California lawmakers with avoiding a rate increase rather than focusing on =
the
underlying flaws in California=01,s market structure.

AB 1 ushers in several important changes to the California market structure=
.=20
It
also contains several key provisions that capture the political mood in the
state. Highlights of the bill include

* Power buying authority transferred. The responsibility for purchasing pow=
er
for the customers of California=01,s IOUs has been transferred to the Calif=
ornia
Department of Water Resources (CDWR). The California utilities will continu=
e=20
to
operate and schedule their remaining generating facilities and contracts. T=
he
difference between the utilities=01, total load and the sum of their resour=
ces
(referred to as the utilities=01, =01&net short=018 amount) will be supplie=
d by CDWR,=20
an
amount of energy that varies between 5,000 and 25,000 megawatts (MW),=20
depending
on the time of year, time of day, and utility plant availability. The=20
utilities
most recently performed this function themselves, buying energy from the
California Power Exchange (PX). However, CDWR has been buying electricity o=
n
behalf of the IOUs since mid-January, when the near-bankruptcy of Southern
California Edison (SCE) and Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) threatened to=20
disrupt
supplies to their customers. CDWR is a state agency that manages water
reservoirs and transportation systems in the state. CDWR uses an enormous
amount of electricity to transport water across California and provides
critical load-shedding capability to the independent system operator (ISO).=
 In
addition, CDWR=01,s reservoirs generate power. The CDWR is thus well integr=
ated=20
in
the state=01,s electric grid but in the past has not executed large, compli=
cated
energy purchase arrangements to supply the customers of California=01,s=20
utilities.

* Portfolio of transactions. The intent of AB 1 is to allow CDWR to execute=
 a
portfolio of contracts to stabilize the cost of power for the utilities and
their customers. CDWR has until January 2, 2003, to execute contracts. CDWR
will take title to power and is thereby not just acting as a clearinghouse.=
 It
has issued a request for bids and seeks a variety of terms, including month=
ly,
annual, two-year, three-year, and longer. CDWR may also enter into options.
Thus, although CDWR=01,s role is intended to be temporary, the contracts th=
at it
executes could extend many years.

* Power for munis. CDWR may purchase power on behalf of some California
municipal utilities at the municipal utilities=01, election.

* New payment scheme. CDWR will be entitled to a portion of existing utilit=
y
rates to pay for the cost of purchased power, interest on bonds, and
administrative expenses. This payment stream will be equal to the differenc=
e
between the generation component currently embedded in utility retail rates
(averaging about $0.07 per kilowatt-hour &#91;kWh&#93;) and the utilities=
=01,=20
costs to run
their own generation plants, costs of bilateral and qualifying facility
contracts, and the costs of ancillary services. The CDWR share of retail ra=
tes
is referred to as the California Purchase Adjustment (CPA). It is not clear
whether the CPA will cover wholesale power market costs. Current prices for
multiyear power contracts may lie above the CPA. In addition, if investors
believe that the CPA is inadequate to cover costs, the entire program may b=
e
abandoned.

* New bonds. Bonds will be issued to secure power. The total amount of bond=
s
issued may not exceed four times the CPA. The state will transfer $500 mill=
ion
from the general fund to jump-start the program, which begins immediately.=
=20
This
seed money and all bond proceeds must be recovered by CDWR from the Califor=
nia
utilities=01, customers (and municipal utilities if they opt in).

* New residential rate freeze. The California Public Utilities Commission
(CPUC) is prohibited from increasing residential customer rates until it ha=
s
completed paying all outstanding obligations. This locks in the recent 9
percent residential rate increase indefinitely. Governor Gray Davis thus ke=
eps
his pledge not to increase rates further.

* Retail competition. To help secure a stable payment stream for the new=20
bonds,
AB 1 enables the CPUC to prohibit the utilities=01, retail customers from=
=20
choosing
an alternative electricity provider until CDWR=01,s obligations are paid.=
=20
Although
the CPUC has yet to act on this, the action would effectively halt the
competitive retail markets in the state for the duration of the CDWR progra=
m.

* Taxpayer protection. AB 1 directs that the new bonds clearly state =01&&#=
91;
n&#93;either
the faith and credit nor the taxing power of the State of California is=20
pledged
to the payment of the principal of or interest on this bond.=018 Thus, the =
bonds
are secured only by the payment stream from utility rates.

*No assets affected. The CDWR is granted neither ownership nor control of
utility assets.

Ironically, the authority now granted CDWR is what California utilities had
essentially requested last summer when they sought to stabilize electricity
prices by executing a portfolio of transactions. The utilities were never
provided sufficient authority to execute term contracts. In addition, the
utilities have more experience to perform this function than CDWR.

Rather than aligning retail rates with wholesale electricity prices,=20
California
has sidestepped the issue by simply transferring the electricity purchasing
function. SCE and PG&E are still left to contend with uncollected costs fro=
m
past energy purchases, although they will no longer incur costs associated=
=20
with
buying power in the current wholesale market while charging frozen retail
rates. The utility liquidity crisis has not been resolved.

It is not clear whether the law=01,s prohibition on rate increases for=20
residential
customers can be achieved. The law is silent on rate increases for commerci=
al
and industrial customers, providing a potential path for recovering=20
higher-than-
expected costs. Alternatively, CDWR could conceivably find contracts of
sufficient duration and low enough price that the rate pledge is met. These
contracts would lock in today=01,s retail rates for a long period of time.

AB 1 is just one of the steps that state officials hope will restore the po=
wer
system in California to a more stable footing. Key tasks remain.

* California=01,s wholesale market structure, which helped cause the supply=
=20
crisis
by ensuring that it was not profitable or possible to build generation in
California, remains unchanged. The term contracts CDWR is likely to sign wi=
ll
provide a mechanism for mainly existing generators to lay off risk but will=
=20
not
be sufficient to encourage the build of sufficient new facilities. In=20
addition,
California=01,s siting and permitting process remains largely unchanged.

* The state must still address the need to expedite the development of new
power plants.

* AB 1 does not provide for the recovery of uncollected past wholesale ener=
gy
costs of California=01,s utilities. The state has been negotiating a deal w=
ith=20
the
utilities that may involve the transfer of generation or transmission asset=
s=20
to
the state. However, the utilities have achieved recent court victories that=
=20
may
pave the way to a court-directed recovery of these costs. Recent audits
indicate that SCE and PG&E recovered their stranded costs early in 2000, wh=
ich
should have triggered an end to their respective rate freezes. A legal=20
showdown
between the utilities and the state on this issue may be inevitable.
