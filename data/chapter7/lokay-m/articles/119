I asked Friedenberg if we could have a sample copy of the Western US Natural 
Gas Market Review to see if we want to subscribe.  Do any of you get this 
now?  Let me know.  We use the Midwest Issue quite a bit.  

I would appreciate your review of the publication and what your thoughts 
are.  We can get in the 2000 budget yet if you want to subscribe and are not 
already receiving.
