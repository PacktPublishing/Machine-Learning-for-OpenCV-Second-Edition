*********************************************************

The nervousness driving the gas market that had settled just below the=20
surface during
the relative calm of late September and early October reemerged in force la=
st=20
week.
From mid-September through early October it appeared that a lucky combinati=
on=20
of
mild weather, storage injections above 10 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day,=
=20
and a lack
of storms in producing areas of the Gulf of Mexico had calmed the market
somewhat. Henry Hub prices settled near $5.00 in the cash market, less than=
=20
$0.20
above residual fuel oil. Last week, however, tragedy in the Middle East and=
 a=20
slightly
lower-than-expected storage injection report were sufficient to drive Novem=
ber
Henry Hub prices up by more than $0.50 in two days, to above $5.60.

Mild weather may still soften prices from current levels, but CERA does not=
=20
expect
the relative calm of late September and early October to return to the gas=
=20
market.
Turmoil in the oil market has raised the floor for gas prices, as nearly 1.=
5=20
Bcf per day
of potential gas demand now burning residual fuel oil would quickly return =
to=20
the gas
market should prices decline relative to oil. Also, weather must remain mil=
d=20
through
October, or else US working storage inventories may not reach even 2.7=20
trillion
cubic feet (Tcf) by the end of the month. The headroom for price is much=20
greater, as
distillate oil, the next substitute for gas should gas prices rise, is itse=
lf=20
in short
supply. Shutdowns of industrial facilities represent an important increment=
 of
demand resistance as gas prices rise, and neither switching to distillate n=
or=20
shutting
down production comes easily or cheaply.

Time is running out before the heating season begins, and the market remain=
s
justifiably on edge: upward volatility remains much more likely than any=20
significant
settling in price. As a result, CERA expects natural gas prices to be=20
sustained in the
mid-$5.00s, averaging $5.50 at the Henry Hub during November (see Table 1).=
=20
More
luck--a great deal more--would be required to restore a measure of calm to=
=20
the gas
market.

Gas Storage--The Final Push
October storage injections have varied historically from 4.0 Bcf to=20
approximately 8.5
Bcf per day in the United States, and this year CERA expects them to averag=
e=20
5.5
Bcf per day, a moderate level for the month (see Table 2). The reporting of=
=20
injections
of 62 Bcf during the week ending October 6 precipitated a $0.37 increase in=
=20
futures
prices, but this rate is actually above average for the first full week of=
=20
October. With
the beginning of consistent heating load late this month CERA expects a=20
slowing of
injections, resulting in an end-of-October inventory of 2,707 Bcf--more tha=
n=20
100
Bcf below the previous record low for the end of October.

CERA expects that many storage holders--having begun the winter with record=
=20
low
inventories--will preserve inventories to the extent possible during Novemb=
er.
However, normal weather this year would drive a substantial rebound in=20
heating load
from last year=01,s level and would require added storage withdrawals, whic=
h CERA
estimates will average 5.0 Bcf per day this year. Withdrawals at that pace,=
=20
or even
substantially slower (as occurred during 1998 and 1999), will keep=20
inventories on a
trajectory to hit record lows by the end of March. Low storage inventories=
=20
will
remain a major source of price support, requiring that demand continue to b=
e=20
priced
out of the gas market, and keeping gas prices above those of residual fuel=
=20
oil.
Regional Markets-Winter Rules

The transition to winter pricing relationships is under way, and the start =
of=20
winter
heating demand in the West has narrowed differentials between the supply-ri=
ch
Rocky Mountains and the Henry Hub. Local demand for Rockies supply has also
eased pressure on San Juan Basin prices, and CERA expects differentials=20
between
both regions and the Henry Hub to continue to narrow through November. In t=
he
Northeast differentials will begin to widen with the onset of winter, with =
the
magnitude of the differentials depending on early winter weather. The onset=
=20
of flows
on Alliance will limit increases in the Chicago differential during Novembe=
r=20
(see
Table 3).

CERA=01,=01,s outlook by region follows:

* Rockies. Early-season cold has narrowed Rockies to Henry
Hub differentials so far this month. Ample supplies within the
Rockies will mean volatile pricing relationships through the
end of October and early November depending on heating load,
but in general strong regional demand will keep differentials
well below the ($1.00) per MMBtu summer level. CERA
expects a ($0.45) per MMBtu differential to the Henry Hub
during November.

* San Juan. The increase in local heating demand in the Rockies
will continue to ease pressure on San Juan prices by limiting
flows south out of the Rockies. San Juan differentials should
follow the same relationships as Rockies prices, with general
narrowing but continued volatility through November. CERA
expects an average San Juan differential of ($0.38) per MMBtu
for November.

* Permian and Mid-Continent. Tight relationships between the
Permian Basin and Mid-Continent and the Henry Hub should
continue through November, with some slight widening in the
Mid-Continent basis differential expected when Alliance flows
commence. CERA expects differentials of ($0.11) per MMBtu
and ($0.08) per MMBtu, respectively.

* Chicago. The beginning of service via the Alliance Pipeline
during November is the focus of most attention in the Chicago
citygate market. However, the demand rebound that would
result from normal November weather this year would offset
most of the added supplies. As a result, Chicago differentials
will average in the $0.08-$0.20 per MMBtu range even when
Alliance flows commence, although delay of the Vector
Pipeline will keep much of the new gas in the Midwest. CERA
expects average November Chicago differentials of $0.13 per
MMBtu.

* Northeast markets. Normal weather would drive a substantial
rebound in New York citygate prices from year-earlier levels,
but there is little added delivery capacity into that market.
CERA expects New York to price $0.66 above the Henry Hub
during November, well above the current low o mid-$0.30s.

Canadian Markets--Supply Growth Still Uncertain
The supply build is uncertain at this time because flows on Alliance are=20
uncertain. A
line pack of between 5 and 6 Bcf has been established, and modest flows of=
=20
200-300
million cubic feet (MMcf) per day have been initiated to test and commissio=
n=20
the
pipeline. The start-up is still slated for November 1, but the unknown=20
quantities of
gas that are flowing on a day-to-day basis are making it difficult to asses=
s=20
precisely
the volume of supply being produced. At this time, it appears that October =
is=20
on par
with 1999. The current expectation is for over 15,500 well completions in=
=20
2000,
approximately 8,500 of which are expected to be gas wells. Even if the=20
shallow trend
does not change substantially, the sheer number of wells is still expected =
to=20
produce
a supply build by year-end and into 2001. For 2000, the total western suppl=
y=20
build is
expected to be flat with 1999 to slightly negative, increasing to positive=
=20
growth of
350 MMcf per day in 2001.

Demand Slow but Exports Up
TransCanada flows are still down, averaging about 350 MMcf per day less in
October than the year-earlier levels. Storage injections in the East have=
=20
accelerated;
eastern inventories are expected to be above last year=01,s levels at the e=
nd of=20
October.
Storage injections in the West, however, have dwindled, revising the expect=
ed
storage inventories to be even with the five-year average but below 1999=20
levels.
PG&E GT-NW volumes have declined in October and are expected to be slightly
below 1999 levels by 50-100 MMcf per day in November as well. Northern Bord=
er
Pipeline is running about 50 MMcf per day above October 1999 but is expecte=
d=20
to be
slightly below 1999 levels in November. Cooler-than-normal weather has push=
ed
western Canadian demand up slightly but does not offset the lower eastern=
=20
Canadian
demand.

High Prices, Wide Differentials
The AECO-Henry differential has leveled off in the upper US$0.50s to low
US$0.60s and is expected to remain in that range through the balance of=20
October.
For November the differential is expected to average US$0.50, for a resulti=
ng=20
AECO
average of C$6.97 per gigajoule (US$5.00 per MMBtu).
