Copper Eagle Conducts Open Season for AZ Storage Facility 
Copper Eagle Gas Storage LLC., a joint event of El Paso Corp. and Pinnacle West Energy, currently is conducting a non-binding open season to assess market interest in a proposed high-deliverability natural gas storage facility to be located west of Phoenix, AZ, in Maricopa County. 
"We haven't decided whether to firmly go ahead with the project" at this point, said Sheri Foote, a spokeswoman with Pinnacle West Energy, a subsidiary of Phoenix-based Pinnacle West Capital Corp. If Copper Eagle should receive the go-ahead, however, she noted it would be the first storage facility to be located in Arizona. She would not give a timetable as to when a final decision would be made. 
The storage facility would have a working gas storage capacity of 3.2 Bcf, with the capability of withdrawing the entire working gas volume in 10 days, and injecting the working gas volume in 20 days. The project, assuming it gets the green light, is expected to be in service by the fourth quarter of 2004. 
The non-binding open season, which began last Tuesday, will run until Oct. 24 at 5 p.m. CDT. For more information about the project and the terms of the open season, go to web site www.coppereagleGS.com <http://www.coppereagleGS.com> or telephone Russ Kovin at (832) 676-5659.
