Title: No Rest for a Weary Market

*********************************************************

Rather than enjoying a respite, western energy markets will make November
a catch-up month. Natural gas demand will remain high when compared with
the same period last year, as gas-fired generation will continue to run at 
high
utilization rates and market participants try to restore gas storage to normal
levels. The tight supply situation will maintain upward pressure on gas
prices, which will range from $5.15 to $5.83 per million British thermal
units, depending on location. Refueling outages at three nuclear units, along
with a seasonal decline in hydroelectric output, will maintain gas-fired
generation on the margin for most of November. On-peak power prices will
remain higher as a result, in the $86-$98 per megawatt-hour range,
depending on location.
