Thanks Laura, Michelle is sending me a copy of the operating agreement that was signed August 2000. I'll get a copy to Earl when I receive it. By the way I'll be out of the office until August 6th. I can be reached by pager, cell phone or the best way is to call my office 505-260-4003. That will page me along with ringing my cell phone. Thanks again for everyone's help.

RJ
