We need your assistance!!!

You, on a weekly basis, submit bullet items to Steve for posting on ETS' Intranet Update page.  Steve edits and reviews the bullets   prior to publication.  

We would like for you to take time each week to review the final version of the week's bullets.  Compare and take note of the changes Steve incorporates, i.e., adding phrases such as - MMBtu, operational fuel, etc.   Steve should spend less time editing and more time reviewing your accomplishments, don't you agree?

Please call if you have questions and thanks in advance for your cooperation,
