John, Kevin, Jeff, and Steve,
After yesterday's Marketing Roundtable meeting, I have given further thought to the idea of interconnect services for customers that would bring lower costs by avoiding the contribution in aid of construction and possibly other markup fees that the pipelines are required to charge.

Attached is a strawman of how this might work.  

 

Please take a look at the document and "tear it apart."    The more vigorous your analysis the quicker we will know if this is a concept worth pursueing further.
Also, do any of you have a sample deal currently on the table that we could test this concept on?  

Best regards,
Sarabeth
