Here is the suggested general format for soliciting bids from shippers by phone for the Red Rock expansion.  Drew and Mary Kay have discussed this and have given the go-ahead to start calling.

	- Bids will be accepted until 5:00, March 2
	- Guidelines for bids that meet the threshold for making our project economic are [describe the three "menu" alternatives -- $0.60 at 5 years, etc .]
	- Bids will be evaluated based on highest rate.
	- Shippers should indicate whether they would be willing to have their bid capacity prorated in case an allocation is necessary.
	- Bids should include:  1) service request and 2) offer letter stating material terms (rate, term, points, quantity).  Offer is binding.  It can include a regulatory "out" in case the FERC rejects our filing, but cannot be "subject to management approval."

The only shippers that will be contacted are those that responded to the Nov. open season in a timely fashion.  

Previously we discussed allocating tie bids pro rata.  While we believe this is acceptable, we would prefer to not announce the tiebreaker methodology so far in advance.  Shippers who inquire should simply be told that any ties will be broken using a nondiscriminatory method.

Please see me if you have any further questions.  (I have to leave about 9 for a doctor's appt. but hopefully will not be out too long.)
