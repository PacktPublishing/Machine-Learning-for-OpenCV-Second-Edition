Michelle,

I wanted to know about connecting into the suction of WT-1 (Not sure I have
the name correct, but the station located off of HWY 180/62 Carlsbad/Hobbs
Highway).  We have a line we are evaluating converting to lean gathering.
It passes about 1 mile from this station.  Is it possible to connect there.
We will be looking for 19 MMCFD initially and then increasing to 30 if the
volume shows up.  We currently have about 13 MMCFD we would take into this
point.
