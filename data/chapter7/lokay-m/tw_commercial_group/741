I forgot to tell you at our staff meeting that on December 27 FERC approved 
the tariff sheet we filed authorizing TW to grant contractual ROFR rights to 
FTS-1 shippers that do not automatically qualify for such a right.  In other 
words, for contracts that are not maximum rate for more than a year, we can 
still agree to give the shipper a ROFR without having to file the contract as 
a material deviation.
