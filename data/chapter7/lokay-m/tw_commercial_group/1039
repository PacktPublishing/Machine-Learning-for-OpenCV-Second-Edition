We have finalized negotiations with Oneok Westex on the new 200,000 MMBtu/d interconnect with TW in Ward County, TX.  The final agreement has been emailed to them for their signature.  TW's costs are approximately $28,000 including the gross up for tax purposes which is fully reimbursable from Oneok.  The meter is a high-capacity ultrasonic meter which will take gas from the Oneok Red River system and deliver it into TW south of WT-2.  The POI is #78161.  Oneok says they are ready to flow; I have not heard yet from our field whether or not TW is ready.

Let me know if you have questions.
