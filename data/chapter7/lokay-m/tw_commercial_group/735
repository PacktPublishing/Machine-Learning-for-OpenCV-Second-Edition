Michelle,

Further to our conversation of last  Friday, could you please verify if we 
are meeting at 1.30 pm or 1 pm tomorrow. 
Tomorrow in the meeting we will explain you the process that needs to be 
followed in order to launch Transwestern products on EnronOnline. It may also 
be a good idea to have your legal person present in the meeting so that they 
can  also understand the process.

Regards
Naveed Ahmed
