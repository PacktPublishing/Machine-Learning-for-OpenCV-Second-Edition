New Mexico Train De-railment - Most of this week was spent helping customers 
re-route gas as the train derailment on TW's right-of-way in McKinley County, 
New Mexico forced Operations to blow down the mainline in the east of Thoreau 
area.  The accident reduced flow to the California border by 250,000 MMBtu/d 
or 25%.  Once the 27 rail cars were removed, a determination was made that 
line would need to be hydro-tested to ensure no damage had occurred.  
Approximately 2000 feet of pipe was excavated, the coating inspected and/or 
replaced, and if test results are good, the line should be back in service 
sometime during the weekend of November 3.  While the pipe is being recoated, 
the line segment will only operate at 80% of maximum pressure.  TW costs and 
revenue losses are being tracked to enable us to recoup damages from 
Burlington and/or Enron business interruption insurance.

Sempra Trading - The loss of gas supply from TW's east end enabled us to sell 
a max rate IT agreement for 100,000 MMBtu/d to Sempra during this outage.  
Duke also moved 40,000 MMBtu/d of alternate volume west at max rates.

Transport Options Tariff - The deadline to file protests on TW's Transport 
Options Program was Monday October 30.  Twenty-two parties filed 
interventions, of which only three were protests: PG&E, SoCal/Sempra, and 
Dynegy.  We expect FERC to schedule a technical conference sometime in the 
next 30 days.

Non-binding Open Season - The solicitation was published and sent to 
customers this week asking for expressions of interest in capacity turnback 
or pipeline expansions across all of TW.  Responses are due November 17th.
