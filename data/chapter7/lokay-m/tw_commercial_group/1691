Jeff,

The attached link will take you to the summary document that we mentioned.
<http://www.pge.com/pipeline/library/por/gtrans.pdf>.

Once again, thank you for bringing everybody together for today's conference
call.  Our objective was to simply provide a clear understanding of our FERC
Section 7 filing related to our gas transmission and storage assets and to
hopefully gain your support.  

As always, please contract me if you have any questions!

Sincerely,

Allen DeBrum
Energy Trading Representative
