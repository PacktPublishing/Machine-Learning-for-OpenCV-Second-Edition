Could you please get with T.K. and have her put in the appropriate rates in CBS for the 
following contracts:

CR #		Shipper				Effective		MDQ
27803		BP				1/1/03 - 12/31/04	25,000
27813		Sempra				2/1/02 - 2/28/02		15,000
27819		PG&E				2/1/02 - 10/31/02	20,000
27821		Cinergy				2/1/02 - 2/28/02		  5,000

I believe these are all the new contracts that have been done recently.  If I missed any
please let me know.

Thanks!
