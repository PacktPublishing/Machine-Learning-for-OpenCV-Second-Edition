Interactive Open Season - Two packages of transportation capacity were post=
ed=20
on Friday 7/21 for auction.  Strong markets out west indicate we should=20
expect at or near max rates for the 3-month space and above average bids fo=
r=20
the 12-month space.  We expect 6-12 bidders to actively participate.  A=20
significant amount of time was spent by all team members working with IT=20
personnel modifying the existing computer system to enable the auction to=
=20
take place.  Thanks to all who made this come together.

Duke - We sold to Duke a firm transport agreement that will bring 20,000=20
MMBtu/d of incremental supply to TW's east end at the Crawford receipt=20
point.  The contract is a 2 year FT agreement beginning 8/1/00 for 20,000=
=20
MMBtu/d from Crawford to Oasis (EOT - EOT) at $0.02 for year 1 and $0.0250=
=20
for year two.

NGPL Winkler I/C - This interconnect was activated on Monday and began=20
flowing gas its first week of operation.  We received a nomination of 40,00=
0=20
MMBtu to supply western gas demand.

Southwest Gas - We received the shipper executed agreement in our office th=
is=20
week!

August Gas Sale - 10,000 MMBtu/d was sold for the month of August at=20
$4.10/MMBtu.

SoCal - Visited their office to discuss among several things the issue of t=
he=20
Needles Window.  SoCal's fluctuation of this set point has hampered TW's=20
throughput for several months now.  They agreed to give Transwestern a chan=
ce=20
to meet the 750,000 MMBtu/day.  The window has been 750,000 MMBtu/day and=
=20
above since our visit and TW=01,s deliverability has not been a problem. =
=20
Additionally, PG&E has raised their window to 300,000 MMBtu/d.  These two=
=20
events combined allowed TW to deliver near-record throughput to California=
=20
this week.  Thanks to everyone, including all Ops Team Members for helping=
=20
make this happen.

PG&E - Met with Market Center personnel to discuss storage opportunities fo=
r=20
both TW & PG&E.  They were interested in the idea of using TW=01,s Park'N R=
ide=20
Service when their storage was allocated (a role reversal from when we=20
initiated this program last year).  The Market Center and TW will continue =
to=20
talk daily to pursue any storage opportunities that arise.

El Paso Merchant Services was provided a 10-year proposal for transportatio=
n=20
in TW's East of Thoreau Area for a potential power plant load off of the=20
PG&E-Intrastate line beginning November 2001.  Initial expected load=20
requirements of 10-15,000 MMBtu/d may increase to 75,000/d during the term =
of=20
the agreement.  This would be incremental supply into TW's east end.

Unbound Technology - Met with Unbound representatives again this week.  Thi=
s=20
wireless message provider gave us a draft proposal outlining potential=20
services TW could use in an effort to be more proactive with customers=20
regarding noms, confirmations, cut notices, and auction information.  We wi=
ll=20
review the draft internally and follow up with them next week with addition=
al=20
questions.

Cross-Functional Team Meeting - Attended the Operational Team meeting in=20
Albuquerque this week.  We gave a short presentation on the status of vario=
us=20
capital projects, proposed transport services, and overall market condition=
s=20
that are impacting the pipeline.

Aquila - Gained $35,000 in the realignment of points on an existing Aquila=
=20
contract.
