Audrey,

Since the project is in full swing and things are moving fast, it would be good to have someone who has been involved with the project to attend and address any issues Steve's area may have.  I will ask Andy Brady, the IT project leader,  if he can recommend someone that has been working closely with the project.

Thanks, LV

Lillian, Steve Harris will be out of town on Thursday.  Is it necessary to have someone attend in his absence?
