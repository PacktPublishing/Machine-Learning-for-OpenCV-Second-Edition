Transwestern is seeking your assistance in conducting a workshop on its 
proposed Transport Options Program.  We are asking a small group of our 
business partners representing a cross section of Transwestern's customer 
base to help us resolve some of the remaining details of the program.  During 
the 2-hour workshop, Transwestern will attempt to answer questions raised by 
its customers following the original rollout of the program a couple of weeks 
ago.  It is hoped that following the workshop, we can put the finishing 
touches to a service offering that merits the support of those involved in 
the workshop group as well as the FERC and Transwestern's shippers.  We ask 
that you send both a commercial representative as well as a regulatory or 
legal representative in order that we can address the full range of issues 
affecting this proposed filing.  Below are the details of the meeting:

Double Tree Hotel
400 Dallas Street
Houston, TX  77002

Meeting Room: Fannin Room, 2nd Floor
