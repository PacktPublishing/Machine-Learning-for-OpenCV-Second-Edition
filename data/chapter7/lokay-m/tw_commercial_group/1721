Thanks for attending the meeting this morning.  I hope it was useful.  As we discussed, I have added 3 slides to the end of presentation analyzing the west contracts by season and by month excluding the 13 month blow out period.  The new slides are pages 46-48.  The entire presentation is attached.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
