Please be advised that we successfully converted existing data and implemented the new contract/capacity release system for Transwestern last week.  With that, there is one change that will impact the Commercial group.  In the old CBS system, the Contract Admin group was responsible for identifying whether a contract was negotiated as a one-part or two-part rate.  Until a deal sheet is built and the new rates/revenue system is implemented, the Marketers will continue to update discounts in the existing CBS system under Negotiated Rates Maintenance.  

Additionally, the Marketer will be responsible for updating within the same rate maintenance screen the one-part/two-part flag for all new firm contracts under the 'reservation' charge code.  If a contract amendment requires a change to this indicator, this must also be captured; however, be advised that this field does not have effective dates.  Therefore, if the indicator is not applicable until a future date, the one-part/two-part flag cannot be updated because the current billing will pick up this change.  I will provide any additional training if necessary regarding the loading of rates/indicators.  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

As a reminder, we have scheduled internal demos of the new system today at 1:30pm and 3pm as well as this Thursday at 1:30pm in EB3907.


Thanks,
Elizabeth
