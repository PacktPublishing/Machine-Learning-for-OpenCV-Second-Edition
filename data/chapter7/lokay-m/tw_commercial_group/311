E prime would have interest in the following expansion plans:

1.  Creating a Cunningham/Maddox connection directly from the Linam plant:
Dave Engbrock (303-308-6002) would have more information on this idea in
terms of volume and rate commitments.

2.  Increasing the CIG/Tumbleweed interconnect capacity from 40,000 to
60,000:  During the summer, e prime flowed up to 15,000 from CIG into TW's
PEPL Pool;  if this capacity were expanded, we might be able to get more
supply off CIG.  The problem we had this summer was that at times the
capacity was reduced to 25,000 due to operational reasons, and that was not
enough room for all shippers.  Any additional supply that e prime brings in
from this area will most likely go to shippers who already have firm
transport to California, or e prime may be interested in shipping this to
the Waha area.

3.  E prime would be interested in 10,000/d of capacity from NW Pipeline to
Socal Topock--term could be anywhere from 1 to 2 years, rate would be the
maximum rate.

If you have any additional questions, please feel free to contact me at
303-308-6072.
