The Newark Group has withdrawn its bid for 800 MMBtu/d Needles expansion.  (After looking at the contract I sent to them, it appears their lawyers had red-lined the entire agreement and that for such a small volume it wasn't worth it!)  Not a big deal, but how should we proceed with awarding the 800/d?  I think BP would take it or maybe Oneok.  What do ya'll think?
