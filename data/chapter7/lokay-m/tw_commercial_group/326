Here's as good a treatise on the subject as I've seen.  I think this articl=
e=20
does an excellent job of trying to explain the recent California market=20
phenomenon...

Gas Daily

No quick fix for soaring California gas prices
In the past year, gas prices in most regions have doubled and in some cases=
=20
tripled.  But no
region has seen the breadth of the price blowout now under way in the West.
While Henry Hub futures on the NYMEX appear to be leading the way for highe=
r=20
winter
prices nationally, most industry professionals are watching in amazement at=
=20
the fundamentals-driven
price surge centered in the Pacific Northwest and California.

The cost of gas in Southern California has been skyrocketing.  Prices last=
=20
week started
trading in the $7-$7.50 range and by Wednesday were trading $14-$18.
The cost of gas entering into the Northwest region of California via the N.=
W.=20
Sumas,
PG&E Citygate, and Malin interconnections also soared to incredible heights=
,=20
some pricing
nearing $20/mmBtu.

The most obvious cause of the dramatic escalation is scarcity of gas.  The=
=20
bullish fundamentals
in California include heavier-than-normal heating loads due to uncommonly=
=20
cold temperatures,
planned and unplanned nuclear plant outages that substantially increased=20
demand
for gas-generated power, depletion of storage in Southern California and=20
transmission constraints on regional pipelines.

Improving deliverability into Southern California is key to bringing the=20
market back into
balance, said one trader, noting constraint-causing problems that have=20
plagued pipelines serving
the region, including Kern River Gas Transmission, El Paso Natural Gas and=
=20
Transwestern
Pipeline.

Those problems had come to a head in part because of high summer prices tha=
t=20
helped
drain storage in Southern California and discouraged refill before the=20
winter, he said.  Now,
unseasonably cold weather has hit the region, amplifying market needs to me=
et=20
heating loads
and produce power. Add growing and competing markets in the desert Southwes=
t=20
and Northern
California and you have a crisis.

=01&It shows that when you get all the stars aligned, there is not enough g=
as to=20
meet demand,=018
he said.  At most, only 15%-20% of California=01,s supply of gas comes from=
=20
in-state producers, with
the other 80%-85% coming from out-of-state, said Bill Woods with the=20
California Energy
Commission.  Roughly 60% comes from the Southwest, 15%-20% comes from Canad=
a,=20
and the rest is
Rocky Mountain supply.

=01&At the moment, there is a lot of gas being purchased out of Canada.  Bu=
t=20
because of
imposed restrictions and other flow transmission problems, prices are=20
soaring,=018 he said.
At the moment, a lot of the new gas production in the Southern California=
=20
area is mainly a
byproduct of oil exploration and production =01* so any new natural gas=20
production will be
associated with what the demand for oil is, he said.
A majority of the =01&dry gas=018 producers are located in the northern par=
t of the=20
state, which
until recently, was primarily a captive market of Pacific Gas & Electric. =
=20
But new production
efforts are under way, he said.

=01&I definitely think that there needs to be some additional action taken =
to=20
enhance our own
in-state production efforts, but there are a lot of bureaucratic hurdles to=
=20
contend with before a
company can just go in and start drilling,=018 he said.
=01&Hopefully, once the cold weather comes off, and our electricity loads s=
tart=20
moderating,
I think pricing will adjust respectively. But until then, I guess we have n=
o=20
choice but to
deal with it.=018=20
