Transwestern accepts all Natural's suggested changes except for the
following 2 sentences which we will add to the end of Paragraph 1:

Transwestern shall have the right to review and approve the design
drawings as soon as they become available and prior to the beginning of
construction.  Transwestern's field personnel may observe the testing of
the over pressure protection equipment and/or emergency shut down
