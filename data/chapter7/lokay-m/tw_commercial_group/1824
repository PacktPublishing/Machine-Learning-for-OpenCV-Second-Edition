On February 27th, the FERC approved TW's Electronic Contracting filing to become effective March 4, 2002.  We made the filing to correspond with the implementation of the new contracting system in Market Services.  Shippers can still contract via fax and in writing; however, they will now (I believe after this coming weekend) by able to do requests and contracting electronically.  This include capacity release.  There were a few minor changes in the shipper requests requirements, but I believe most of these were already occurring; we just updated the tariff language.  

One change which is very different is that a service agreement must be signed and returned within 15 days instead of 30 days. 

If you have any questions, please call myself (x54600) or Teb (x36868).
