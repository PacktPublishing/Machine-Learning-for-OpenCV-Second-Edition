Lindy,

	This is missing the pool cuts. The system will cut in the following order:
	
	Cut IT by price 1st (Overrun & IT)
	Cut pro-rata Outside the path transactions next in this order:
	1.	Alt. Receipt to Alt. Delivery(outside the path)
	2.	Alt. Receipt to Primary Delivery (Outside the Path)
	3.	Primary Pool Receipt to Alt. Delivery (Outside the Path)
	4.	Primary Physical Receipt to Alt. Delivery (Outside the Path)
	Cut pro-rata Inside the path transactions next in this order:
	1.	Alt. Receipt to Alt. Delivery(Inside the path)
	2.	Alt. Receipt to Primary Delivery (Inside the Path)
	3.	Primary Pool Receipt to Alt. Delivery (Inside the Path)
	4.	Primary Physical Receipt to Alt. Delivery (Inside the Path)
	Cut Pro-rata any primary to primary transactions next in this order:
	1.	Primary Pool Receipt to Primary Delivery
	2.	Primary Physical Receipt to Primary Delivery

Keep in mind some of the other factors when scheduling like evening & I/D 1 cycles are bump cycles.
Once Alt. is scheduled in a cycle . it can not be bumped by primary firm, Incremental gas is cut before flowing gas, TW's FTS3 & EFHB are scheduled in a separate transmission and point allocation process, & LFT is scheduled to zero during the rollover and balance process if we have called No LFT available, otherwise, LFT is scheduled like Firm. 


 
Thanks Ramona

1st     Primary to Primary
2nd    Primary to Alternate (Inside)
3rd     Alternate to Primary (Inside)
4th    Alternate to Alternate (Inside)
5th    Primary to Alternate  (Outside)
6th    Alternate to Primary  (Outside)
