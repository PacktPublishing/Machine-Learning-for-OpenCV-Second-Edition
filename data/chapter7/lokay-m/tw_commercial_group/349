EIA Rolls Out Long List of New Gas-Fired Power 
Between 2000 and 2004, a total of 145,417 MW of nonutility generation is 
expected to be added to the U.S. power grid and 83% of that total will be 
gas-fired power generation, according to a new survey by the Energy 
Information Administration. 

The EIA's Inventory of Nonutility Electric Power Plants in the United States 
find that a total of 799 new gas-fired units, totaling 120,645 MW in 
nameplate capacity, are scheduled to be added by the end of 2004.  The 
Southeastern Electric Reliability Council is expected to receive the largest 
portion of new nonutility generation with an additional 252 units totaling 
36,636 MW.  SERC is followed by ERCOT with 109 new units totaling 21,775 MW, 
ECAR with an expected 181 additional units totaling 17,733 MW and MAIN with 
140 new units totaling 17,139 MW. 

The largest amount of new nonutility capacity, or about 61,823 MW, is 
expected to be added in 2002.  About 46,551 MW of new capacity is scheduled 
to be in service next year. 

Electric restructuring has led to a boom in nonutility power generation.  The 
EIA report found that total nonutility generation in 1999 reached 167,357 MW, 
which was a 71% increase from the previous year.  However, only 21% of the 
total represented new plants.  In 1999, about 50,000 MW of electric utility 
generation assets were purchased by nonutility generation companies.  At the 
end of 1999, nonutility generation accounted for 19.8% of total electric 
generation in the country.  The totals reported by EIA include all operable 
units, even those that did not run at all in 1999 but are expected to return 
to service. 

Gas-fired power accounted for the largest share of nonutility generation last 
year, and the Pacific Census Division accounted for 31.4% of that gas-fired 
capacity. The Pacific Census Division also accounted for the greatest number 
(1,167) of total nonutility generation and the most nonutility capacity 
(33,254 MW). California was the dominant state in the division with 30,189 
MW. 

Gas-fired (only) generation represented 29.4% (49,353 MW) of total nonutility 
capacity in 1999, and petroleum/natural gas (fuel switchable/combined) 
generation accounted for 24.2% (40,508 MW) of the total. Coal represented 
28.9% (48,501 MW).  Hydroelectric power accounted for 3.6%. Petroleum (only) 
totaled 2.2% and all other sources amounted to 11.5% of total nonutility 
generation. 

The top five states based on existing nameplate capacity are California 
(30,189 MW), Illinois (24,013 MW), New York (17,256 MW), Pennsylvania (12,483 
MW) and Texas (12,376 MW).
