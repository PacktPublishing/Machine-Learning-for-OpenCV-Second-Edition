Sorry, I was looking at the wrong row, BP's contract is 22,000/d (Sempra's contract with June 30, 2001 trigger is 30,000/d).

FYI,  BP's ROFR trigger on their 30,000/d Ignacio to Blanco contract was June 30, 2001.

Also, there is 15,000/d of unsubscribed, not subject to ROFR, Ignacio to Blanco capacity available for December, 2001 (just one month).  Since there seems to be some interest recently, I didn't know if we would want to go ahead and sell this now.

There's also 6,500/d of unsubscribed, not subject to ROFR, Blanco to Thoreau capacity available for December, 2001 too.

(Perry, This is what I have in my spreadsheet.  Please confirm these numbers for December 2001.  Thanks!)
