In addition, it's my understanding that the border numbers are the take-away 
capacity at the border, not El Paso's delivery capacity.  EP is still down 
several 100 MMBtu/d due to lower line pressure restrictions mandated by Fed 
DOT after the New Mexico explosion.

Yes, these numbers are the posted volumes according to their bulletin board.  
Update, as of 01/23...PG&ETop is 699 (61%), SoCalEhr is 1195 (96%), and 
SoCalTop ios 538 (100%).  These volumes are slightly above last week's 
posting.  I was told that the board was the official source for throughput 
information; but, I will see if there is another source.

Are you absolutely positive about these numbers? With all the problems in CA 
how could El Paso not be flowing more at Topock? I know we are taking up part 
of the space but it seems like they should be full to SoCal as well. Please 
reconfirm with other sources.
