The Commission issued a draft order in Docket No. RP00-249 today accepting 
TW's tariff sheets to acquire offsystem capacity on PNM, effective Sept. 15, 
subject to the following conditions:

The tariff sheets are accepted for a 2-year period subject to TW's refiling 
within 15 days of the order to 1) limit its acquisition to a max. of 40,000 
MMBtu/day and 2) to limit the firm service to the non-peak summer period.  
Also, TW must file a report with the Commission at the end of the 2-year 
period detailing what impact, if any, the proposal has had on the market.  
After the report is filed, parties may comment on the report.

We agreed to the 40,000 MMBtu limit but not to the non-peak period or the 
20-year limit.  Let's discuss whether we should seek rehearing of the order.
