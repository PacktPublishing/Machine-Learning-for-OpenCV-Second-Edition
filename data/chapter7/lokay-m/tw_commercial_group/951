Darrell informed Burlington late on Friday that we will have an unplanned o=
utage next week for two days.  We will talk with their commercial folks on =
Monday morning to make sure that they are in the loop.  We anticipate that =
we can be back online by September business so Burlington can proceed ahead=
 with their September business as usual.  We will also talk with the other =
SJ players to help fill the gap so that we can maintain 800,000MMBtu/d down=
 the lateral while Burlington is down. =20

Thanks, Kim.  =20

The effect will be to the Burlington (low pressure) system only.   We can s=
till flow 800 mmcfd down the lateral, we will just need to make up the low =
pressure volumes recieved from Burlington through the high pressure custome=
rs.  I've discussed with Darryl....

Today Burlington is flowing approximately 130 mmcfd.  Limited to 800 mmcfd =
down the lateral due to Gallups condition. =20

What will be the volume impact during the outage? Thanks.

A conf. call has been set up for Monday morning 9:00 a.m. CST to discuss a =
force majeure situation on the #3 unit at the San Juan Compressor Station. =
 877-795-3687 pin 475577=20

Overview:  (for those uninvolved to date)
     In a walk through of the San Juan Station with the Team Thursday eveni=
ng 8/16 it was noted that severe settling issues on yard piping existed.  T=
he Team had been working with Engineering on developing an action plan to a=
ddress over the last several months.  Upon a visual inspection we requested=
 that the Team contact a local contractor and have the pipe cover (dirt) re=
moved immediately to allow the piping to relieve itself.  This would provid=
e the necessary time to follow up with Engineering and attain feedback on t=
he status of the project and implement remedies.  The Team had a contractor=
 on location the following Monday 8/20, and work removing the cover was com=
pleted this Monday 8/27.  However, the expected results were not achieved. =
 In other words the piping did not spring back to the degree that pipe stre=
ss concerns were eliminated.  We requested that a structural engineer be se=
nt to the site immediately to evaluate the integrity of the piping.  He was=
 on location Thursday morning (8/29).  In a phone conversation with Phil Di=
ckenson (Trigon structural engineer) he mentioned that his immediate concer=
n was how this much displacement could not induce high stresses.  However, =
no pipe coating cracks were visible so he wanted an opportunity to input th=
e data in a model and evaluate prior to making any recommendations.  He did=
 offer, that at a minimum, we stand a good chance of exceeding the .5 desig=
n factor, but without reviewing the data further he would not commit to a c=
onclusion.  We asked that he work through the evening, if required, to prov=
ide the necessary information with regards to the pipes integrity.   While =
waiting on Trigons report, we notified the Team and asked that they contact=
 Foutz & Bursham (local pipeline contractor) and get an evaluation from the=
m on the estimated down time it would require in a worst case scenario to m=
ake the repairs/replacements.  (4 to 5 days)  We then requested that the Ro=
swell CDC (Ernie DeLosSantos) determine the availability of approximately 1=
50" of X42 356 wall 10" pipe, 12 ea. Y42  365 wall 90's, and 1 ea. Y42 365 =
wall 45.  (all material is available at Redman Supply in Farmington) =20

Conclusion:   =20
     Mr. Dickenson called with the results this morning and informed us tha=
t we appear to be exceeding allowable stress levels.  The stress levels cal=
culated by Dickinson were in excess of yield as follows:  1.09% of SMYS at =
the connection between the recycle/surge line and the discharge header, and=
 1.01% of SMYS at the elbow immediately outside the building wall on the 10=
" recycle line.    His recommendation was that the piping be cut and re-wel=
ded to return the piping to a lower stress condition and that suitable pipe=
 supports, not subject to subsidence, be provided.

     Conference calls with Engineering (Spalding, Eisenstein, Rance, Pebdan=
i, Minnoti ???) were set up to review the data with Mr. Dickenson and it wa=
s decided to have Greg McIlwain on location Monday in conjunction with Mike=
 McCracken to initiate the necessary repairs.  After much discussion with D=
ickenson with regards to the modeling performed, Engineering indicated that=
 the system is Operational and therefore we will remain loaded until early =
next week when repairs are made.  The repairs will be isolated to the #3 un=
it only so, the downtime is not expected to exceed 2 days (48 hours).  Howe=
ver, furhter evaluation by McIlwain will confirm timelines. =20

If anyone has questions through the weekend prior to Mondays call, I can be=
 reached at 520-853-3253.
