Glen, just hung up with Calpine. They have the Pastoria plant. Currently,
they have signed up for 100 mmcfd with Kern 03 capacity. However, their Las
Vegas plant may be able to take this capacity in which case they would be
open to alternatives. I believe SoCal is making a proposal to serve this
location as well. Mark, IGS.
