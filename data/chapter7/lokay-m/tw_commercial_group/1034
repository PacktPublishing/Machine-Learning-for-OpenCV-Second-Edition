Glen, I thought I pass this tidbit of information on to you and the Enron
team. I was speaking to a PG&E manager yesterday attempting to get an update
of where PG&E thinks it stands on it open season application. Bottom line
this individual had just received word a few minutes before that
Commissioner Bilas was writing a Proposed Decision that would "deny" PG&E's
application. Therefore, PG&E's open season would be closed down. I will
follow up next week.

On another important initiative, PG&E's Gas Accord II, apparently PG&E's
long awaited application is still hung up with the bankruptcy attorneys.
Given their Chapter 11 status, I am sure that their application which
includes spending hundreds of millions of dollars for system upgrades
requires review and preliminary approval from the bankruptcy attorneys and
eventually the judge. I will keep you posted.
Mark Baldwin, IGS.
