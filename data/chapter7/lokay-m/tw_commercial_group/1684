Michelle, 

Per our conversation on January 2, please assign 3735/dth of available
West Texas Pool receipts for contract 27641 during the four months
beginning November, 2002 and ending February, 2003.  We will continue to
look for the remaining 2000.


As for Amendment 3 which increased our West Texas receipts to 14265
during the period described above, I do not see anything.  Can you send
me another copy and I will get that signed today.  Sorry for the
confusion.

If you have any questions, please give me a call.

Best Regards
David
