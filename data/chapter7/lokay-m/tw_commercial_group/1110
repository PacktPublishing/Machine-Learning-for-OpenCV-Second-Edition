Yesterday in our meeting regarding Red Rock and future expansions Eric stated the current capacity through Station 8 is between 590,000 - 600,000 MMBtu/d.  Contractually, Transwestern currently has 599,500 MMBtu of firm transportation pathed through Station 8.  

SoCal Gas' FT allows for 200,000 MMBtu of firm receipts in San Juan and 306,000 MMBtu of firm receipts EOT.  Typically, SoCal baseloads the 200,000 MMBtu each day from the San Juan, so historical use of EOT receipts has not exceeded 106,000 MMBtu.  

Eric - If the San Juan Lateral was to go partially or totally down and Socal nominated its 306,000 MMBtu of EOT receipts, given our current contractual obligations pathed through Station 8 and the 150,000 MMBtu Red Rock capacity, would the lower pressure at the junction allow us to move up to 750,000 MMBtu/d from EOT?
