Hi Michelle - here are the months that there are scheduling discrepencies
from January 1998 forward and the scheduled volume that I have. I can fax
you the daily volume for each of these months so we can narrow down the
research.

01/00  Mojave 842,128 TW 842,127   Difference = 1
03/00  Mojave 912,977 TW 912,917   Difference = 60
06/00  Mojave 606,535 TW 606,534   Difference = 1
09/00  Mojave 1,674,721 TW 1,662,566  Difference = 12,155
11/00  Mojave 857,540 TW 854,874   Difference = 2,666

12/01  Mojave 616,730 TW 616,524   Difference = 206
