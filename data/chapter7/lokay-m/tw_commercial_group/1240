Do you have Conoco's account?  We talked about this last week.  Did you say that you were working-on a termination letter on the three Conoco contracts and how their ROFR works with our notice of termination of the evergreen?  They are:

	20747	mainline	10,000/d	termination 2/28/02	month to month evergreen
	20748	mainline	10,000/d	termination 2/28/02	month to month evergreen
	20835	san juan	20,000/d	termination 2/28/02	year to year evergreen

They all can be terminated by either Party with 365 days notice prior to the end of the primary term.
