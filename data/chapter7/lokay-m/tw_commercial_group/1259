For your convenience and/or use by your customers, I've revised the proposed term sheet to include the two (2) altenative sharing mechanisms that your customers should base their bids upon.  This term sheet also includes a second example of how the sharing mechanism works.

Subject:	Additional bid criteria

We've been asked to go back to the shippers and secure two (2) bids on the capacity.   Ask your shippers to look at the term sheet and give us a bid on (1) the [original] 30% sharing mechanism on alternate west flows, and (2) a 50% sharing mechanism on alternate west flows.  Let them know we realize that the 50% sharing mechanism will likely result in a reduced reservation rate, however, we'd like to see both "looks" at the deal.  Also, whether we choose the structure with a 30% sharing, or the 50% sharing, let them know that we'll make our decision on best bid [on Friday] based on the highest NPV of reservation bid.
