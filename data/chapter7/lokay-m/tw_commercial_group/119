Subject: 2001 Plan - Resubscription Assumptions

Please let me know your availability to meet for 1-2 hours either Wednesday 
or Friday afternoon to discuss the resubscription assumptions for the 
following blocks of capacity that become available in the year 2001.  It 
would be helpful to get some long-term and short-term quotes before our 
meeting (so maybe Friday is better) to discuss the future value of this 
space.  (Of course, contracts can extend past Dec-01, but these are the 
months we need for the plan.)  Let's discuss various combinations of these 
segments as well (for example:  Can we get more for IG to BL space if we 
ultimately combine to subscribe IG to WOT?)

EOT to WOT    20,000/d Feb-Dec
EOT to WOT    70,000/d Nov-Dec
EOT to WOT      8,000/d Apr-Dec
(Currently subscribed at $.13  to .15)

BL to TH    20,000/d Dec
(Currently subscribed at max)

EOT to EOT    10,000/d Mar-Dec
EOT to EOT    15,000/d Apr-Dec
EOT to EOT    25,000/d Oct-Dec (currently sold seasonally 40/25/10)
EOT to EOT  440,000/d Nov-Dec
(Currently subscribed at $.0075 to .11)

TH to EOT     20,000/d Dec
(Currently subscribed at max)

IG to BL     48,000/d Jan-Dec
IG to BL       4,000/d Feb-Dec
IG to BL     15,000/d Dec
(Currently subscribed at $.03 to .06)

S. IG to BL  158,500/d Jan-Dec
S. IG to BL    26,000/d Feb-Dec
(Currently subscribed at $.02 to .06)

Thanks!  Lindy
