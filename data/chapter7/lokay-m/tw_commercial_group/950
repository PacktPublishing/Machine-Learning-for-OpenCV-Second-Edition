Michelle,

=09I forget that you started with the team after I quit working on the TW A=
greements; here's a brief update on what our "normal" process was previousl=
y.  We can change anything if you've found a better process...

The Deal Capture Team (Craig & Esther) processes all FTS discount related a=
mendments for TW Marketing.  The Contract Group processes the new (base) ag=
reement and any POI/MDQ/TERM type changes.  All FTS service requests still =
go to Contracts and, after the Capacity/Credit issues are completed and the=
 contract printed out, the entire contract folder is forwarded to Deal Capt=
ure for additional processing (all firm contracts/amendments get sent to De=
al Capture for review).  Deal Capture gets with the Marketer to determine i=
f a Discount is being offered and then creates the Discount Amendment, Rout=
es it for approval (if needed) and Tenders all documents to the Shipper.  D=
eal Capture is responsible for obtaining all approvals other than Capacity =
and Credit.  When (if) the Agreement is executed and returned by the Shippe=
r, Deal Capture will handoff the original documents back to Contracts for a=
ctivation and to complete all additional distribution and processing.  Let =
me know if you have any concerns or questions.  As the first few deals go t=
hrough, we'll need your feedback to see if the process needs some adjustmen=
ts.  Thanks for all your help...

Craig
