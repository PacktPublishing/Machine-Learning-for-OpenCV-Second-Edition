Maria moved the new provision into paragraph No. 2; other than positioning, nothing changed from the first Route...

Please review the attached amendment to TW K# 27714.  This amendment was previously routed/approved; however, paragraph No. 7 (in red) has been added.  Please respond with comments and/or approval to Craig Buehler as soon as possible.  We would like to tender this amendment tomorrow (10/5/01).  Contact Michelle Lokay with questions (x57932).  Thanks

Craig

"For the term of this Amendment, Transwestern agrees to provide an additional discount to the Shipper for quantities that could not be scheduled hereunder due to an event of Force Majeure, as reasonably determined by Transwestern,
rendering the supplies unavailable.  The additional discount will be an amount equal to any quantities made unavailable multiplied by the Discounted Rate."

This contract needs to be amended for the above paragraph.  Legal (Maria Pavlou) has already approved and PPL is expecting this change.  Thanks!
