Michelle sent me the attached (different version) this morning for approval where she changed the first paragraph.  I've reviewed the original version Susan Scott just sent as well.  It appears that most of the changes were just spelling out "Transwestern."  I am ok with both versions as long as we have the July, 2000 date correct.  Please send me the final version that goes out for my records.

Michelle, as I mentioned in my voice mail, the other lawyers wanted a few changes.  My sincerest apologies for the confusion.  Apparently you and I were actually working off an old version of FGT's letter, not the one they ultimately approved and used.  Since you are out of the office, I've taken the liberty of forwarding it to Carl without you reviewing it first, since I know we want to mail this out soon.  

Carl, Michelle advised me that EOL's lawyer had approved the previous version so I assume they will want to review this one as well.  Let me know if there are any concerns.

Thanks!

Susan (x30596)
