Sheila--

Currently, the TW Market Team manually calculates the various prices associated with our negotiated rate deals at the end of every month.  Once the calculation is complete, the price is input into the billing system so customer invoices can be generated.  I have 3-4 people spending a full day every month end performing this rate calc for their deals (no two are exactly alike).

These calculations are all based on various published market indices.  As you evaluate the development and installation of the new contract billing system, is there a way we can automate this rate process?  Were it not for the manual labor process, the TW team would likely do more index-based negotitations.  

Please let me know your thoughts and timing.

thanks
Kevin Hyatt
