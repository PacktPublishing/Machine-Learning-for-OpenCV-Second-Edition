As reported in Gas Daily today, the CPUC has issued a report assessing the state's gas infrastructure of the three major utilities in California.  Their conclusion is that the natural gas transportation and storage systems are adequate to provide seasonally reliable amounts of competitively priced natural gas to residential, commercial, industrial and electric generation customers.  Therefore they recommend that the Power Authority should not finance any new natural gas projects.  Other conclusions: conservation will reduce demand on the infrastructure, improved coordination between electric and gas operations can enhance reliability, and the CPUC should continue to evaluate the need for gas infrastructure expansions.  Below is the link if you would like to review the entire report.  gh
