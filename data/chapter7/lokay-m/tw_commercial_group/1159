We need your help!

On Tues 4/17 at 2:30 pm in room 49c2, the TW Market Team will meet with the software business development team to review criteria to be included in the new ETS Invoicing System.

We will review the structure of current negotiated rate transactions (and their manual rate calculations) plus try and define additional pricing flexibility we would like to see incorporated into a new system.

What you need to bring:

	1) Ideas for various market-based rate calculations
	2) Brief pricing description of current deals we manually calc rates for on a monthly basis
	3) Other parameters you feel the system should include

If you have a conflict with the above date, please see me.  Meeting should last no more than one hour.

thanks
Kevin
