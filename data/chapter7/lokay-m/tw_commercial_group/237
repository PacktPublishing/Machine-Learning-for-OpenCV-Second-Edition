individuals whom you want to receive a Xmas card from TW.  Please also make 
any necessary changes / deletions for those people whose company names have 
changed or who have left the company.

I would like your changes completed no later than Friday Nov. 3.  thanks for 
the help.

P.S.  You may also hand write your changes and submit them to Audrey.
