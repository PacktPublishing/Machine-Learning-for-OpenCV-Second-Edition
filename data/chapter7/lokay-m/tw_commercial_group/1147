Please advise if the 750 exchange and set-up is acceptable.

Julie - we can assign a centrex line (713-750-xxxx) number for him.  I will have to order call notes from SWB (monthly charge) on this for his voicemail.  This will work totally different from the Lucent phone with it's only feature being call notes.  Please be sure Eric understands this.  I'll let you know the due date this will all be completed.  It will probably be another 5 working days to get the order completed by Bell.

Let me know if you have any questions.   I apologize for the delay...this request did not make it to my group.

It was good to talk to you and thank you for your assistance yesterday.  Louis Porter quickly resolved issue and I learned a feature on the phone system.  
I have an unique request and wanted to get your expert assistance on the below request.  The physical phone will need to be set up in Eric Gadd's office, EB4162.  The phone should have the features such as voice mail and send calls. 
Charge to Co#1439, Cost #112442.   If you have any questions, please call me at x33597. Thanks.

Subject:	Mavrix phone

Per Legal's recommendation, please order another phone for Eric Gadd.  He is the officer representing Mavrix and needs a phone number that is not associated with Enron (no 853 or 345 prefix).  Thanks.
