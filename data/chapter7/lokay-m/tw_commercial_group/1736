Attached is the Transwestern Capacity Release Report that lists all capacity release transactions for the period effective 2/1/2002 forward. 

A couple of things to note:
PG&E released two separate packages of gas for 25,000/day from Bloomfield to CA [one was at a fixed rate and the other is index based].
Socal indicated that the core customers they provided capacity via capacity release protested a ruling by the CPUC and won; therefore, these monthly prearranged releases are back on for now.  Because the decision came in late, Socal was not able to release for the full month of February.
ENA's capacity on K #24924 was again successfully released for February with TW collecting marketing revenues.

If you have any questions, please let me know.



 

Thanks,
Elizabeth
