For the short Thanksgiving week of  November 20th-November 22th:

Transwestern weekly average deliveries to California were 941 MMcf/d (86% - 
due to pipeline maintenance) while east deliveries averaged 310 MMcf/d.  San 
Juan lateral throughput averaged 789 MMcf/d while receipts from Rio Puerco 
averaged 27 MMcf/d.  

El Paso average deliveries to California were 2,491 MMcf/d (85%) :
- PG&ETop (capacity 1,140 MMcf/d) deliveries averaged 495 MMcf/d (70%)
- SoCalEhr (capacity 1,250 MMcf/d) deliveries averaged 1,102 MMcf/d (88%)
- SoCalTop (capacity 549 MMcf/d) deliveries averaged 521 MMcf/d (97%)


Other pipeline throughput to California:
- PGT ( capacity 1,901 MMcf/d) throughput to California averaged 1,627 MMc/d 
(86%).   
-  Kern River (total pipeline capacity 700) throughput to California averaged 
225 MMcf/d (32%). The remaining 475 MMcf/d  (68%) is assumed delivered to the 
Las Vegas market.


The cash PG&E/Topock - SoCal/Needles spread went from  $.80 Monday spread to 
to a $1.23 Wednesday level.

Daily Cash prices were absolutely wild this week at the southern California 
border.  Monday's cash price of $13.42 went to $17.35 by Wednesday.  San Juan 
and Permian cash prices each had some increase and by Wednesday were  $6.32 
and $6.40, respectively.  This price spike occurred despite the fact that 
total California sendout (sum of interstate gas, intrastate production & 
storage withdrawals) decreased from last week's 7.6 BCF/day level to this 
week's level of 7.2 BCF/day.
