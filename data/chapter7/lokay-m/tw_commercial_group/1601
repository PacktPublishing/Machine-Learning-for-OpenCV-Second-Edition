Below is a new well Phillip's has completed in the Panhandle that appears 
to be very close to a TW pipeline.  Would you be the person I would 
discuss a possible interconnect with TW?

Trumbell #3, Morrow test.  Sherman County, Texas.  999' FNL & 974' FWL, 
Section 246-Blk1T-T&NO Survey.  Perforated morrow interval.  Well kick off 
        and flowed ~ 8.5 MMcfd, fp 625 psi.  Shut in well w/1025 psi at 
wellhead.  Shut well for pipeline connect.  Recommend high pressure connect.

Thanks,
