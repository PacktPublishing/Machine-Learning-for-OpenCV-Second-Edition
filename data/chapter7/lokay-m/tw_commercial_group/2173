Settlement discussions have hit the wall.  Conoco, the third of the Indicated Shippers the commercial group was going to talk to, cancelled their Friday meeting stating that their regulatory folks told them they shouldn't meet with Transwestern (Re: Negotiated Rate Proceeding) unless all of the indicated shippers were present... never mind the fact that TW had already met individually with BP/Amoco and Burlington.

Exceptions to the October 24, 2001 Initial Decision are due by Thursday, November 8, 2001.  TW will need to response with in seven days.  I have asked Steve Stojic, with the assistance of Maria, to circulate the first draft.  

Any questions, please let me know.  Greg
