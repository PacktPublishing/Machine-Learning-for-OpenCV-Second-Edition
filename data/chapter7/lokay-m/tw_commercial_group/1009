Hey guys (or actually for our current group, girls),

Let's plan on getting together on Wednesday, Aug. 1 from 2:00 to 3:30 in EB4180.  The following is a list of things that we need to discuss and they are in no particular order of priority.  To the extent that each of you could volunteer to come with some or all of the information on the following items, it will expedite our discussion (just let me know that you would like to begin pulling this information) :

Price Spreads for ROFR contracts to articulate our resubscription strategy.
Imbalances on OBA's
Analysis of I to I spreads.  -  Review past fixed rate transport deals and compare to the historical spreads.  Would we have made more money?  Is it reasonable to carve out a percentage of our capacity portfolio and always sell on an I to I rate?
Update Map - coordinate with Darrell, Facility Planning and NNG.
West Texas Leg - discussion on our preparation for the Facility Planning/Marketing Strategy Meeting.
Arizona Strategy - including Sun Devil.
Pooling.
Analysis of our business sold and utilized.  FT, Alt. Points, IT and contracts sold for specifically for flexible delivery points. (On this item, we can discuss the type of analysis we would like to look at in our staff meeting prior to pulling any information)
Weekend on call schedule - update
Phones
Update - replacement for Jeff's position.
Frequency of our staff meeting.
Industry Conferences
Vacation Schedules


Also, please let me know of additional items that you would like to have discussed in our staff meeting.  I would be happy to include them.

Thanks, Kim.
