Hi Michelle!

I am assuming that, like most IT agreements, we can put a base agreement in
place and then negotiate short-term discounts when available from time to
time (last time I talked to T.K. about this capacity it was discounted to
like a penny or 1.5 pennies)?  One of the reasons that we've never gotten
anything accomplished here is that we alway's seem to be doing in the middle
of bid-week.

So, if we can, I'd like Bryan to work with you immediately to begin the base
agreement processing.  OK?

Thanks!

Scott

Because our San Juan lateral on Transwestern is fully subscribed, we are
only able to offer Interruptible versus Firm transport.  The Commodity
charge is .1031, plus .25% fuel.  Please call next week when you arrive
in Albuquerque and we can process the Service Request.  Thanks.
