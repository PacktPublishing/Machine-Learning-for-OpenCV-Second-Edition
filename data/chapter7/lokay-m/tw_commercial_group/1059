Joe,
Here's the final version for your approval and execution.  As we
discussed, if possible, we need you to execute and return via facsimile
a signed copy as soon as possible this  morning.  You are the last
contract to get signed here and we are at the deadline to authorize G.E.
to proceed on the turbine production schedule today.  Also, look for a
facsimile from me that has the form Transportation Agreement attached.
You'll need to sign that and return it along with the Privileged and
Confidential Agreement.

I know we were diametrically opposed on a couple of issues here, but I
genuinely appreciate your professionalism and commitment to see this
negotiation through to a successful conclusion.  Thank you.

Regards,

Jeff
