Optimization/ Facility Planning Team Weekly Report
Week of September 25 - 29, 2000




ET&S Outages  (Outages: Jerry Graves  713/345-8923)=20





System Optimization Team  (Team Leader: Ben Asante  713/853-9432)

TW Fuel Performance Measurement Model (FPM)
Working with the SCADA support group to identify the equivalent SCADA point=
s=20
to existing MIPS Points, for conversion of the model to a real-time basis. =
An=20
initial query revealed that only ~50% of MIPS points have a SCADA=20
equivalent.  Priority will be given to identification/addition of points on=
=20
the San Juan Lateral and the Thoreau Junction to Needles. =20

Developing an estimate of the time required to complete the conversion of t=
he=20
FPM Model to a real-time basis.

TW Fuel Performance Measurement for Fuel Overage Forecasting
The Revenue/Risk Management group are analyzing the existing FPM model=20
groupings to evaluate the use of our model in combination with their demand=
=20
model.  The combined model would provide fuel burned on forecasted demand. =
 =20
Initial analysis looks promising and they hope to give us an answer by next=
=20
week whether the FPM model can be used as is.=20

Beaver to Mullinville B-C Sweeping=20
 Pipeline operating conditions have been analyzed since the sweep was=20
completed on 09/21/00.  Recent sweeps had improved flow efficiency only abo=
ut=20
5%.  Last week's sweep improved the efficiency by 35% to about 85%.  Pressu=
re=20
drops decreased from 125 PSI down to about 40 PSI.  Mullinville has operate=
d=20
with one less 2000 HP unit while Beaver units are operating with less load=
=20
while producing lower suctions.

Outage Modeling
Ran hydraulic models for Gas Control to determine flows with Bisti down and=
=20
with Unit 303 down.

San Juan Efficiency Study
Developed multiple scenarios for San Juan flows and pressures if the line w=
as=20
to be cleaned.  Basic economic analysis was also performed.

Hydraulic Model for EOTT
The current EOTT hydraulic model has been revised to include the dependence=
=20
of the fluid properties on temperature and pressure as well the appropriate=
=20
heat transfer considerations.


Houston Facility Planning Team    (Team Leader: Perry Frazier 713/853-0667)

TW Expansion Studies=20
Looked at different combinations of pipe loop and compression trying to=20
reduce overall costs.  No luck so far.  A brainstorming session is schedule=
d=20
next week to see if there are any different approaches not considered to da=
te.
El Paso Field Services
Compiling information for inclusion into the Interconnect and Operating=20
Agreement between EPFS and Enron.  Mostly locations, materials and POI=20
number, expect to have all information gathered by the end of the week.

San Juan Lateral
Enron Operations Services has visited 3 laboratories in the area and compil=
ed=20
information on their analysis procedures.  They want Facility Planning to=
=20
help evaluate and choose one for the sample evaluation.  Results will take=
=20
about 2 weeks.  Also, received some expected flow/pressure enhancements for=
=20
the last 30 - 40 miles of the SJ Lateral, using the expected efficiencies=
=20
calculated for a pressure profile taken after the 1998 chemical cleaning=20
run.   Results will be reported next week.=20

Liberal Operations - PRIDE Meeting
Attended operations meeting in Liberal that covered various areas of=20
operations and ways to improve.  Facility Planning did a presentation on th=
e=20
proposed Emergency Response Program and provided general information on=20
Facility Planning services that can assist Operations.

Prospective Market Zone Wichita, Kansas
Commercial requested market study of competitor pipelines serving the=20
Wichita, Kansas area (Duke, KPL, Williams), research possible load=20
requirements, and facility requirements to connect the area to NNG's pipeli=
ne=20
system.  Wichita is located about 90 miles from the Macksville compressor=
=20
station as a crow flies.
Outage Coordination=20
 Provided the study to determine flows on the San Juan lateral and mainline=
=20
when Bisti outage occurs in October.  Both San Juan and the mainline will=
=20
have reduced flows.  Study results were given to Market Services. Also=20
provided support for System Optimization to determine the flows west when=
=20
Station #3 unit 3 is out of service.

Marketing Strategy Meeting=20
Attended and participated in the Marketing Strategy meeting.  Main assignme=
nt=20
for Planning is to continue looking for revenue generating projects.

E&C
Participated in a review of the responding candidates for the vacant Projec=
t=20
Engineering position.



Omaha Facility Planning Team     (Team Leader: Steve Thomas 402-398-7468)

Earlville Outage
On October 12th starting at 8:00 am the Earlville unit will be taken down f=
or=20
relocation of the blow down silencer.   Solar will also be on site to do so=
me=20
bleed air manifold baffle modifications.  After this work is completed, the=
=20
District will perform a water wash in preparation for emissions testing on=
=20
October 16th & 17th.  The unit should be back on-line sometime near midnigh=
t=20
on October 12th.

With Earlville down for this time frame the flow on the East leg will be=20
limited to the 660-680 mmcf/d range.  We anticipate that normal nominations=
=20
will be below this threshold, and that by packing the system the night befo=
re=20
we will be able to make it through without any impact.   Gas Control is=20
putting this outage on the EBB.  From a Marketing perspective we should lim=
it=20
short term sustainables, but Ops did not want to call an allocation day.  I=
f=20
we did, the allocation would be 86% of firm in Zone D for all deliveries. =
=20

The emissions testing on October 16th & 17th will have very little impact o=
n=20
system flows.

Planning White Paper
Planning met with various Marketing representatives to try and attach a val=
ue=20
to the four ideas put forth in the White Paper.   The ideas were thoroughly=
=20
discussed and the input we received will be incorporated into the Paper.  =
=20
One suggestion was that we use the Pricing Desk to determine the value of t=
he=20
additional capacity.  We will be meeting with them to do that.  Meanwhile=
=20
research continues on the various costs associated with the White Paper,=20
specifically sites for proposed inlet pressure additions. =20

Engineering Records Research
EOG - Texas Co. #4 (C.000269.01): =20
This is an interconnect where the Texas Co. #4 8" Lateral (OKG-19301)=20
connected to the 24" OKM-12001.  An incorrect line number on the project=20
authorization located the project six miles upstream of the actual site. =
=20
Engineering Records did not have the one page amendment with the project=20
authorization to explain who owns and operates the facilities.  Texas Co. #=
4=20
facilities had been removed.  The remaining pipe downstream of the compress=
or=20
site to OKM-12001 (approximately 4.5 miles) has been transferred to EOG=20
Resources as of June 16, 2000.  (Project Authorization C.000369.02/Removal)=
.

Ogden H2S Monitor (SN0157): =20
Verification of materials used in the construction of the monitor was=20
needed.  Operations confirmed that a Farm Tap Assembly was used to create t=
he=20
monitoring facilities, not to install a farm tap within the Ogden Plant yar=
d.=20
=20
Cedar Falls #2
Marketing needed to know if there was any money left in the work order to=
=20
purchase a new regulator, since the interruptible peaking turbine load is=
=20
causing problems with the existing regulator.  Property Accounting reported=
=20
the amount remaining, but it will not be enough for a new regulator.

St. Croix Valley
Provided options for the proposed ten year expansion for St. Croix Valley. =
=20
Examined cost versus incremental growth on the Black River Falls Branchline=
. =20
Provided an analysis for option of integrating the growth with the Wisconsi=
n=20
Gas proposal.  Following the latest strategic marketing meeting, will exami=
ne=20
compression alternatives for St. Criox Valley as a stand-alone project.

Grimes #1 TBS - Pressure Increase
Working with Marketing and the Field.  Examined several options regarding t=
he=20
customer=01,s request for a pressure increase to a delivery of 150 psig. =
=20
Marketing will examine all the options in order to determine best strategic=
=20
fit for the customer.

Ogden Building #2 Discharge Pressure
Research has been completed in trying to locate documentation that supports=
=20
the 1000 psig MAOP for the building #2 discharge header.  The supporting=20
documentation has been forwarded to Lisa Choquette in Codes for approval.  =
If=20
documentation is approved as supporting evidence for the 1000 psig MAOP the=
n=20
only minor controls work will be required in the field in order to increase=
=20
the discharge pressure of the building #2 engines. =20

Pengilly TBS - Mesabi System
Marketing was presented with two separate estimates for modification requir=
ed=20
to increase firm at Pengilly from 12 mcf/day to 210 mcf/day.   The first=20
estimate for $85,000 consisted mostly of contract labor with field personne=
l=20
only installing the EFM.  The team responded with a proposal that they woul=
d=20
be willing to do all of the labor if it could be scheduled during Jan-March=
. =20
A second estimate of $66,000 was submitted to Marketing, which included all=
=20
district labor.  This estimate is contingent on completing the deal prior t=
o=20
Dec 31,2000.  If a deal is made after Dec 31, 2000 then the higher cost=20
estimate applies.

Monroe #1 TBS Mods / Pressure Increase
The Monroe #1 TBS Mods Project was released to Engineering.   The project w=
as=20
the result of WIGas raising the IT load by approximately 4000 mcf/day.  The=
y=20
also requested a pressure increase at the station from 80 psig to 275=20
psig.    A Form 2476 "Pressure Increase Request Form" is being circulated f=
or=20
signature.  The project has a targeted Nov 30, 2000 in-service date.  The=
=20
modifications consist of replacing both meters with spool pieces and=20
performing a pressure test to upgrade the MAOP.

Milbank Project
Continued gathering data to model the Milbank system as it is today.

Melbourne #1 - Project Release
The Melbourne #1 TBS Mods project was released to Engineering.   The projec=
t=20
consists of TBS mods to support the increase of firm from 330 mcf/day to 50=
0=20
mcf/day at Melbourne. Presently the Marshalltown B/L is constrained and cou=
ld=20
not support the incremental firm.  Alliant will realign gas away from the=
=20
Marshalltown #1 TBS which is at the end of this B/L to the Marshalltown #1A=
=20
TBS which is on a different B/L.  This will open up capacity on the line fo=
r=20
this new load.   The project has a targeted Nov 30, 2000 in-service date. =
=20
Modifications consist of replacing the first and second cut regulators and=
=20
replacing the meter.

Adel #1A TBS Mods - project release
The Adel #1A TBS Mods Project was released to engineering.  This project wa=
s=20
a result of the customer wanting to convert an existing IT load at Adel #1A=
=20
to a Firm load.  The new Firm load will be 1400 mcf/day.   The project has =
a=20
targeted Nov 30, 2000 in-service date.  The station will have a new meter=
=20
installed along with piping size modifications.

Ethanol Injection
Reviewed and researched (for Marketing) the possibility of injecting Ethano=
l=20
into the pipeline for a possible "Green Energy" rating and as a means of BT=
U=20
enhancement.  Since ethanol would remain a liquid at any normal pipeline=20
conditions, even atomizing the ethanol at the point of injection would not=
=20
insure the Ethanol from liquefying, dropping out and collecting into the=20
pipeline low spots.  Also, there were many issues concerning possible liqui=
ds=20
entering the fuel systems of our equipment and other customers=01, equipmen=
t. =20
Planning recommended that this project not be pursued.

Researched (for Marketing) was the possibility of burning a Methane/Ethanol=
=20
mix in our equipment (i.e.: Turbines) in order to receive a "Green Power"=
=20
rating.  Solar was contacted concerning the possibility of "co-burning"=20
ethanol and methane.  As a manufacturer they said they would be willing to=
=20
work with us, however, they only recommended it if it were to be a constant=
=20
fuel source.  Solar said there would be considerable fuel injection system=
=20
retrofits required.  Also, if this were not a constant fuel then there woul=
d=20
have to be two separate fuel systems (co-burn and methane only) and a=20
complete fuel control system change.  With all that the project has been=20
deemed cost prohibitive.

Vapor Injection of Propane (VIP Service)
Research was started for Marketing into the possibility of injecting=20
vaporized propane into the pipeline as a way of increasing capacity during=
=20
peak days.  Upon initial review many questions were generated by the planni=
ng=20
team concerning specific requirements of the new service (i.e.: # of days/y=
r,=20
firm, daily firm etc.)  Planning awaits feedback from Marketing before any=
=20
more action is taken.

Electric Generation=20
Proposal was reviewed for Marketing from APA for an engineering study to=20
review the possibility of utilizing stand-by generators as electric produce=
rs=20
for the Utilities during peak power times in the summer months.  A few=20
discrepancies were found and are being worked out before APA can be release=
d=20
to complete the engineering study.

Beaver Dehy
A request was received from John Sturn of the optimization team to review t=
he=20
Capacity of the Mole sieve Dehy system at Beaver Compressor Station on the =
SE=20
24" line.  Beaver is considering a capital project to re-route the dehy=20
system that is currently piped into the suction of the station to the=20
discharge, thus increasing the capacity. =20

Cogentrix Power Plant
Three detailed cost estimates for the Cogentrix Power Plant proposals were=
=20
prepared and forwarded to Marketing.  The details of the cost estimate=20
included a breakdown of costs for:
Material Costs
Labor
Freight and Taxes
Surveys/Permits
Construction Support
District Labor
Engineering/Drafting/As-builts
Contingency
Overhead
AFUDC
The break down of costs was done for the Sheldon, Lehigh, and Raun projects=
=20
in Nebraska and Iowa.

Cherokee Ethanol Projects
Seven sites were examined for a proposed ethanol plant in Cherokee County,=
=20
Iowa.  The delivery volume was for 8 MMCF/D at a delivery pressure of 70=20
psig.  It was assumed for this study that the initial load would be for 4=
=20
MMCF/D for two years and then increase to the 8 MMCF/D level.  The cost=20
estimate assumed that the initial design would be for the 8 MMCF/D.  This w=
as=20
done to reduce the cost for the project.  Each cost estimate was done for a=
=20
firm transport level and an interruptible transport level (14 cost estimate=
s=20
total).  Two of the sites are on the C line approximately 10 miles southwes=
t=20
of the Paullina Station.  The remaining sites were on the Storm Lake/Lytton=
=20
Branchline.
