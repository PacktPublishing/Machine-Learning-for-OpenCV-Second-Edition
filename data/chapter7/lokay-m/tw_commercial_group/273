Michelle, I thought I would pass this along to make you aware that now EOG 
isn't going to supply the EFM at their new location.  Given that they have 
yet to contribute the funds requested for our efforts, I don't think we 
should spend the money to put measurement out there until they send us the 
$10,000.  Maybe we should ammend the interconnect agreement to change the 
estimate back to the $30,000 we originally requested.

Thanks, Bob

On the EFM / SCADA, I talked to Dirk Ellison with EOG. He contacted Jerry 
Ball and their reply was for us to go ahead and get our own equipment. 
Laura's work order doesn't have anything about EFM, only the costs to inspect 
the construction and their connection to our tap valve. Laura will check on 
the responsibility of the EFM equipment tomorrow.

Thanks
Mike
