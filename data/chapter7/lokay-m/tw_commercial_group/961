Please place on your calendars a date with Mr. Stan Horton.  On Wednesday, September 26, Stan Horton would like to have an appreciation luncheon with Steve and the TW Team.  

We would like for everyone to make the necessary arrangements to attend.  If this conflicts with any of your calendars, please let me know as soon as possible. (Via voicemail, since I'm out on Monday and Tuesday.)

Thanks in advance,
