Please build a new point as both a receipt and a delivery on Transwestern.  The point name is "PNM Rio Puerco" and the receipt number is 9240 and the delivery number is 60921.

Another point that need to be built is "Valero Pecos" and the receipt number is 12283 and the delivery number is 500515.

For the point-to-point combination, please build Rio Puerco as a receipt and Valero Pecos (#500515) and West Texas Pool (#58646) as the delivery for IT and FRM transport.

Thanks.
