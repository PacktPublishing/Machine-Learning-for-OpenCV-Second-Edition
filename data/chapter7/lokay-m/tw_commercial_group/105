Audrey:

One part of the computer system was not working for our last Deal 
Profitability Meeting.  Steve wanted to get together in a couple of weeks to 
see the final piece.  I would appreciate it if you could set up a meeting (1 
hour) with the group before 8/17 if possible --  baring the following days: 
all fridays & 8/14.

Thanks.

Dave
