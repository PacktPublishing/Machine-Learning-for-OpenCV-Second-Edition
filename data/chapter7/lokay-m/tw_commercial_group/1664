Stick with the $.08.  Let Greg know you talk with me and Michelle.

TK, 
Just spoke with Greg Hathaway with Virginia Power regarding a Ride at the Panhandle point.   He wants to Ride for 12/13 for 5,000 MMBTu to Park on 12/14.   I quoted him $.08, but he insists that you previously did a deal with him for $.05 and would like to do this at $.05 as well.

Let me know.  Thanks.
