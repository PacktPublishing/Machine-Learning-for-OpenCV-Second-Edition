Please write-off the balances held on the contracts listed below. I cannot 
find any current information to verify the existence or final resolution of 
account balances for the subject contracts.  A review of our billing records 
reflects that the contracts have not been invoiced since December 1998.  The 
net loss of revenue will be negligible compared to the ill will that would be 
generated in attempting to bill these all-but-forgotten, year and a half old 
P&R quantities. 

The monthly invoicing file now tracks P&R quantities carried over from month 
to month. This practice should prevent this problem from occurring in the 
future.  

Note: There are currently two shippers with P&R balances that have carried 
over from previous months. - Reliant PO# 27060 has 1,514 MMBtu parked at POI# 
500621 since April 2000  and Sempra  PO# 27255 has 6,000 MMBtu parked at POI# 
500615 since June 2000.  We will work with Darrell to get these quantities 
returned to these shippers.

Richard, today I gave Mike Bodnar  the PNR contracts listed below to review.  
I'll let you know what the "fix" will be once the Storage desk decide what 
needs to be done; write-off, bill, or maybe even netting two of the contracts.
