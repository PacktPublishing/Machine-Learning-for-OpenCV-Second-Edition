Toby and myself received this message through tw@enron.com.  Since Toby is 
out of the office, I thought you might be able to handle the request.  If 
not, could you please forward it to someone who could.

Subject: Map Request



I am with Henwood Energy Services, Inc.,  headquartered in Sacramento, 
California.? I am looking to get a Gas  Pipeline Map from Transwestern 
Pipeline Co.? Our company is going to be  using the maps for various studies, 
such as an analysis of electric market  clearing prices and where to site 
gas-fired generating plants.
?
If you can help me, please let me know.? If  I have contacted the wrong 
department could you please tell me who to contact or  even forward my 
message to that person?
?
Thank you so much for your help.
