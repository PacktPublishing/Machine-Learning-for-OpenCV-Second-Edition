Pete,
I appreciate your response.  While I certainly understand your position, 
please know that we were careful in choosing the date and time, balancing the 
need to conduct the workshop as soon as practicable with the need to 
accomodate the commercial activities of our customers.  We were told by a 
number of parties that by the last day of the month, most of the next month's 
business has been done.  We also set it up for later in the day to accomodate 
morning trading.

Given your personal experience in these matters and Conoco's involvement in 
gas and electric matters across the county, I really hope that you can find 
time to participate in our workshop.  If not, certainly your efforts to date 
to bring certain questions and issues to our attention have been very 
helpful.  We look forward to working with you on this and other projects in 
the future.

Thanks,
Jeff

Jeff,

Conoco would like to participate in the referenced conference, but because
the meeting is scheduled on August 31st, during gas bid-week, we will most
likely be unable to attend.  However, given the importance of this meeting
to all of TW's shippers, we suggest that consideration be given to
rescheduling the meeting to a later time when all interested parties have an
unhindered opportunity to attend.  This would allow TW to seek input from
the largest possible number of its customers.

We look forward to actively participating in the development of this
proposed service.  Additionally, please place me on the distribution list
for future correspondence.

Sincerely,

Pete Frost
Manager of Regulatory Affairs
Conoco Gas and Power Marketing

Transwestern is seeking your assistance in conducting a workshop on its
proposed Transport Options Program.  We are asking a small group of our
business partners representing a cross section of Transwestern's customer
base to help us resolve some of the remaining details of the program.
During the 2-hour workshop, Transwestern will attempt to answer questions
raised by its customers following the original rollout of the program a
couple of weeks ago.  It is hoped that following the workshop, we can put
the finishing touches to a service offering that merits the support of those
involved in the workshop group as well as the FERC and Transwestern's
shippers.  We ask that you send both a commercial representative as well as
a regulatory or legal representative in order that we can address the full
range of issues affecting this proposed filing.  Below are the details of
the meeting:

Double Tree Hotel
400 Dallas Street
Houston, TX  77002
(713) 759-0202

Meeting Room: Fannin Room, 2nd Floor
Date: Thursday, August 31, 2000
 Time:  2:00 - 4:00 p.m.
 Coffee, soft drinks and snacks will be provided

RSVP your company's attendance by telephone or Email to Jeff Fawcett at
713-853-1521 or jfawcet@enron.com <mailto:jfawcet@enron.com> .  Your
