Please find attached a letter from Lad and Pat of Socal.  TW was requested by Socal to reallocate the Needles "window" on intraday 1 cycle last Friday.  Socal lowered the "window" below TW's firm requirements.  This has not been the policy previously followed by the two companies.  Once the Socal "window" was established on the timely cycle, the window would not change for that gas day.  I did not want to cut TW's FT shippers late on Friday.  I wanted time to alert them that this policy was changing and they could not rely on getting the same allocation of gas at Needles during each daily cycle.

Lynn and I talked with Pat Davidson and TW has agreed to accomodate any changes (increases or decreases) to the "window" during a particular gas day except for the intraday 2 cycle. Lynn and I told Pat that changing the allocation during intraday 2 cycle would create imbalances on TW's system, and TW was not allowed to have shipper imbalances per its tariff.

Lynn has prepared an EBB posting alerting our shippers of this change.  It will be posted today and the policy will go into affect for Friday's gas day.

Any questions, please call Mrs. Blair!
