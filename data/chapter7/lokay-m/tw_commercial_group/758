You asked for quotes for:

Buying a call spread option for a SJ to Cal Border spread for Calendar 2002 
and 2003 at a strike price of $3.90 (spread exceeds $3.90)
-That was priced at $0.25 for 2002 and $0.20 for 2003.

Selling a put spread option, SJ to Cal Border in the same time frames at a 
strike price of $0.10 (spread drops below $0.10)
-This is basically worthless in that it is inside the variable cost.  

These quotes were from ENA on 1/9/01.

Call me with any questions.
