Subject: TableTalk Session with Stan Horton


At least once a month, Stan likes to meet informally with different parts of 
the organization to hear from employees about what's going on.  During these 
TableTalk sessions, Stan also shares the latest Enron information and answers 
employee questions.

Please plan to join Stan on Monday, November 6, 3:30-5:00p in EB-49C3 for a 
TableTalk Session with the TW Commercial Group group.  

Ahead of the meeting, Steve will get with a few of the TW Commercial Group 
employees to ask them to give Stan a short, informal update on what's 
happening in our group.  This will facilitate an open discussion with Stan. 

At the session, Stan will also field any questions you have.  If you prefer, 
you can pre-submit your questions for Stan to Gina Taylor.  

I hope you'll make plans to join Stan on November 6.  This is a great 
opportunity to "hear it from the top."
