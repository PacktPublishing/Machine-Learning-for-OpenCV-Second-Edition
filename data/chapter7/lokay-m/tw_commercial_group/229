Southwest Gas - Conversations with SWG indicate that somewhere along the 
construction path for the interconnect, TW approved the installation of the 
meter bypass piping (we are waiting for engineering to confirm this).  If 
this is the case, we will ask SWG to install skillets or padlock the valves 
so it cannot be used without TW approval.  In addition, we are proposing to 
amend the start date of the SWG transport contract so that TW may resell the 
unused space in early November on a daily firm basis.  

USGT - US Gas Transportation is protesting the Market Center deal we 
negotiated during our brief September outage.  We re-negotiated the original 
invoice from $140,000 down to $113,000.  USGT has countered with $65,000 
citing mis-communication on the original deal.

Plains Farmer's Co-op - Higher gas prices have created an additional level of 
credit exposure across our customer base in terms of transportation 
balancing.  For September, this small Co-op had accumulated a balance payable 
to TW of approximately $440,000.  The customer indicated they would be 
sending us a payment of $250,000 but so far has only sent in $75,000.  Our 
credit department has demanded a Letter of Credit be put in place for 
$500,000.
