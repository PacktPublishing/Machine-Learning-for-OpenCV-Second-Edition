The existing capacity of this system is 38 mmcf/d.
Now that we know where the exactl location of the tie-in is and based on  your input I have created two flow modeling options for this project::
 
Option-1:
Assuming 30 mmcf/d from Lanam Ranch, the Monument Station can do another 12 mmcf/d from Conoco at 576 psig pressure for a total of     42 mmcf/d. If the pressure at Lanam Ranch reduces, it will change the capacity to a lower figure. 
  			

  Option-2:
  Assuming 0 (zero) from Lanam Ranch, the Monument Station can handle 62 mmcf/d from Conoco at 696 psig pressure.

						


If the pressure at Conoco reduces, it will create higher differential pressure at monument and that will reduce the capacity.
If you have any comments please e-mail me as soon as you can so we can finalize the capacity of this system.

 1 What is the legal description of this tie- in? Northeast corner of R35E, T20S, Section 24

  2) What is the maximum pressure that Conoco can provide at this point?  Per Conoco, max sustainable pressure would be 700#

  3) If the volume from Conoco is going to be 60 mmcf/d, how much gas are you planning to flow from the existing Lanam Ranch interconnect ( 0 to 30 mmcfd range)
	We would only flow 60mm from Conoco if Linam was delivering 0.   Conoco would be the "swing" supplier" based on what Linam was giving to TW.  If you determine that with Conoco's interconnect location and operating pressure that the Monument line and compressors would do 75mm (for example), and Linam gives us 20mm, then we theoretically could take 55mm from Conoco.

  4) What is the pressure commitment at Lanam Ranch  - Per Darrel, at over 620#, we start to hit the pressure regulator for the Class III shut in valve, so plan on no more than 620.

   These are required in order to develop a scope /costs for the project.
