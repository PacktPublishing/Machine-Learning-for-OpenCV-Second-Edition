I would like to ask for your help in providing me with the following details for each membership you may have.


1)	Corporate Membership or Individual Membership
2)	Reimbursement of Initiation Fees
3)	Timing of reimbursement of initiation fees
4)	Type of membership reimbursement method (one of the three listed below)
5)	Is there a business reason to continue payment of fees?

	Reimbursement methods:
1)   Flex Perks
2)   Payroll Reimbursement
      3)	Reimbursement via direct payment to employee or to the country club



Should you not have any memberships, please respond to that effect.  I need this information by Tuesday, February 26.

Thank you for your assistance.
