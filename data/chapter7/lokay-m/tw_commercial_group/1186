TEAM- 
	Below is a project request spreadsheet developed by Facility Planning.  We will use this form in an attempt to better communicate and track ALL the various cost estimates and project requests originating from TW Marketing.  This form should at a minimum help to: 1) better track requests, 2) allocate planning and engineering resources and 3) better communicate needs and wants so more accurate cost figures can be generated.  This form is a preliminary step in a larger project that Eric Faucheaux is developing.  

For now, TW Marketing is required to submit this form to FP on any new project requests effective immediately.  If once a form is submitted and the project is later revised, then a revised form must be submitted.  This is a great tool that will not only help us, but will help all the groups that SUPPORT us and our marketing efforts. Thanks for your cooperation.

Kevin, this is okay for now.  Facility Planning will be rolling out a form and procedures in the very near future that we will all use.  Attached is just a sample of the form and general functionality (select enable macros when opening).  I am currently revising it.
