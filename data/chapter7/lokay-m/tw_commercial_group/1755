Michelle,

Would you please write up a full description of what the scope of our plans are with PG&E.  This description will be useful to Kevin Howard as he proceeds to determine the best way to secure funds for this project.  Please send it to me and I will add the virtual capacity write up to it and forward on to Kevin.

Thanks, Kim.
