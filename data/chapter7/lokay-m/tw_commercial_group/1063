Jeff,

Here is some information regarding the supply flexibility/liquidity/quantity on the East end of the pipe.  These volumes are representative of what can, and usually does flow, but given constraints and contract priorities, the volumes do fluctuate.  This list does not include the supply available from interconnects.  Let me know if you need anything else.

Bob
