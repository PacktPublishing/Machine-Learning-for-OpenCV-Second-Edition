The TCR II surcharges are only charged on 20747 and 20748, the mainline contracts, not 20835 (it is a SJ contract).

I guess Conoco CR #20835 would also be billed the TCR surchage beginning March, 2002.

Let me know if you agree.

Thanks again!

Jeanette:

I just reviewed the handout for your presentation on the Global Settlement.  One of your slides stated that the 
TCR surcharge is applicable for 10 years from the Global settlement, even if the CFS's contract expires.

Conoco Contract Nos. 20747 & 20748 expired at the end of February.  I assume we should bill the TCR
surcharge for these contracts beginning in March, 2002.  Please let me know if this is correct.

Thanks!
