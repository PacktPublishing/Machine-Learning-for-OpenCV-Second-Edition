The question below was forwarded to me by Aquila.  The question (in red) is from PPL.  What would be TW's strategy and can someone get back with PPL?

thanks
kh

Kevin, thanks for the document we will have it reviewed in the event PPL
opts to 
use it to meet any credit requirements.

I do have one question that might have been addressed at the informational 
sessions.  Based on the open season documents, Red Lake will interconnect
with 
both El Paso and TW at a minimum, with other points to be determined based
on 
interest. I was wondering if there had been any discussions with either
pipeline 
about the impact of adding this interconnection. I know that may be a loaded

questions, but based on historic flows, in order to guarantee firm
deliveries 
from that receipt point, a shipper would have to move its primary receipt
point 
to the Red Lake interconnection (from say San Juan or East of Thoreau areas
on 
TW) or negotiate alternate arrangements with the pipelines. Sorry for the 
rambling question, but in valuating the asset, the question of
transportation 
inevitably comes up. 

Thanks
David
