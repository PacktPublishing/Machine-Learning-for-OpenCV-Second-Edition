Ranelle,
I'm sorry I didn't get back to you sooner on this.  I do have some questions regarding the attached notice.  What is the counter-offer methodology and when will we use it vs. FCFS.  Our tariff currently allows us to use the NPV methodology and does not state that we can use an alternate methodology.    We need to rewrite the tariff provision.  Until then, we should definitely post the alternate methodology that we plan to use for at least 3 business days in advance.  Drew and Susan and I are supposed to meet on this subject today.  I will get their thoughts as well.  thanks, Maria

Attached is a draft of what could be added to the TW Website's unsubscribed capacity section.  This is similar to what was done for NNG so that if a shipper was looking for unsubscribed capacity on our Website, they would also know we have capacity available on EOL.  The change also indicates that we may be using a different methodology for selling/awarding capacity than we have in our tariff.  What do you think?
Ranelle
