Here is my first draft of a "paper the file" letter to BP Amoco.  I need you all to carefully review it for factual content and to make sure I got the tone right.  I'd love to be even harsher, but I've already implicitly accused them of bad faith, so I'll stop for now (sure felt good).  Thanks.  df
