Attached is a letter I drafted (with comments from Mary Kay and Drew) reminding shippers that the deadline for bids has passed and that bidding will be opened up to all interested parties.  The consensus was that this letter might help eliminate any misunderstanding about the open season process.  Please send this to your respective shippers (only those who sent a timely response to the open season).  Also attached for your reference is a posting I'm having Toby put on the website.
