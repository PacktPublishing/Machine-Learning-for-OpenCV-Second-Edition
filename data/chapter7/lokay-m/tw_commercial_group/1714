												as alt pt on each contract (until we move to new system)

3531	TW/NNG Beaver				Panhandle Deliveries			Already exists under PHDEL template
500176	Dale Ferguson Tap			Panhandle Deliveries			Needs to be added to PHDEL template
500203	Continental Follette			Panhandle Deliveries			Needs to be added to PHDEL template
500390	Sum WTG Delivery Pt 			Panhandle Deliveries			Already exists under PHDEL template

Lindy - Could you verify if POI #57096 is still valid for any reason?

Ramona - It appears that some of these points are available for displacement.  In the new system, Linda indicated that a separate group has been set up for any points you have identified as valid.  I will assume then that these should not be added to the paired template (ie, if a delivery point allows displacement, then they will only be added to the related basin delivery template.  Nominating this point as a receipt would depend on the displacement grouping defined in the new system for pools and interruptibles.).


Thanks,
Elizabeth

Subject:	TW Contract Template Clean-up

In cleaning up some template information, the following points were found to be on no templates. 

	1. Do they belong on a template?
	2. Is the template listed the correct one?

Unless I hear differently, I will go ahead and update the templates accordingly.
