Thanks Michelle, I got the agreement and am looking at it and forwarding it internally for review.

Also, can I get a copy of your filing that you make with FERC regarding this Red Rock expansion?  Is that something that you can easily fax or e-mail to me?  If not, then could you get me the filing numbers.

Thanks, Terri Dickerson
