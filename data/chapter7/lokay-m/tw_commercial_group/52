Subject: Transwestern Record Throughput

 Today we reached another milestone on Transwestern for total volumes flowing 
West and down the San Juan Lateral. Our volumes on the lateral were a record 
878,000 dth/d and flowing West were a record !,065,000 dth/d.

 This tremendous accomplishment is due to several factors including the 
success of the TW Commercial Team in fully subscribing all capacity including 
Daily Firm and LFT (there is no more space!).  In addition, the significant 
effort put forth by Market Services, Gas Control, Facility Planning and 
Operations to identify all capacity and make it flow should be recognized. 
Thanks for a job well done and supporting the team effort! 

  Steve
