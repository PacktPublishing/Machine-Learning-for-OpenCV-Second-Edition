Enron Corp. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") are exposed to market, cre=
dit, operational and liquidity/funding risks in the normal course of its bu=
siness activities.  The Enron Corp. Board of Directors approved a new Risk =
Management Policy (the "Policy") on August 14, 2001.  This Policy establish=
es a framework under which the Company's exposure to risks shall be evaluat=
ed, managed and controlled, and pursuant to which capital will be allocated=
 and preserved.  The Policy focuses on four major types of risk: (a) market=
 risk; (b) credit risk; (c) operational risk and (d) liquidity/funding risk=
.  These risks shall be managed on a portfolio basis for standard transacti=
ons via various market risk limit structures and credit approval processes,=
 and for non-standard transactions via the Transaction Approval Process and=
 the Guarantee Approval Process.   This Policy provides an overview of vari=
ous risk measurement tools and limits to be applied to these risks, and the=
 roles and responsibilities for the key participants of the risk management=
 framework. =20
