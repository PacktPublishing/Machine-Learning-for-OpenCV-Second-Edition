As Enron employees, we are responsible for conducting the business affairs =
of=20
the Company in accordance with all applicable laws and in a moral and hones=
t=20

To make certain that we understand what is expected of us, Enron has adopte=
d=20
certain policies, approved by the Board of Directors, which are in the Code=
=20
of Ethics July 2000, formerly known as the Enron Conduct of Business=20
Affairs.  This year, we=01,ve made some revisions to our Code of Ethics to=
=20
address recent policies approved by the Board of Directors and adopted by=
=20
Enron.  These changes include: =20

=01  Principles of Human Rights have been added, which describe Enron=01,s=
=20
responsibility to conduct itself according to basic tenets of human behavio=
r=20

national boundaries (see pg. 4);
=01  Additional information about our Business Ethics policy about legal=20
contracts, the selection of outside counsel, and disparaging remarks made b=
y=20

The Code of Ethics contains commonsense rules of conduct that most employee=
s=20
practice on a day-to-day basis.  However, I ask that you read them carefull=
y=20
and completely to make certain that you are complying with these policies. =
=20
It is absolutely essential that you fully comply with these policies in the=
=20
future.  If you have any questions, I encourage you to discuss them with yo=
ur=20
supervisor or Enron legal counsel.

d=20
a Certificate of Compliance, which you must sign as a statement of your=20
agreement to comply with the policies stated in the Code of Ethics booklet=
