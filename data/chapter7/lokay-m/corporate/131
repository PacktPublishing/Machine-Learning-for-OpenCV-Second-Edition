The initial phase of construction on I-45  is scheduled to begin Sunday, 
October 1, all southbound lanes will be closed Sunday night at 7:00 p.m., 
with a detour at I-10 eastbound to US 59 southbound.  Two southbound lanes

 The southbound exit ramp to Pierce/Dallas will be closed during the initial 
phase of this work.

 Additionally, the entrance ramp from Allen Parkway eastbound will be closed
