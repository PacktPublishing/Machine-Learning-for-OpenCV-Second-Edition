It's six months into the new Millennium.  Where do you get your company 
news?  Enron, cited as the Most Innovative Company in America for five years 
in a row, prints a newsletter every two months.  We could reorganize entire 
business units between issues.  Twice.

Don't worry.  Our printed newsletter isn't going anywhere; it's still the 
best way to bring you detailed accounts of Enron's long-term business 
direction and achievements.  

Let's just say that print has a new friend.  And -- you guessed it -- that 
friend is the dot.  As in "dot.com"; as in you now have an online connection 
for fast-breaking news about and around Enron.  It's called eBiz, and it will 
change the way you get news.  It might even change the way you think about 
news.  

eBiz will come racing across the Enron intranet on home.enron.com every two 
weeks, and we will post breaking news and announcements as they happen.  The 
news in eBiz will be so fresh and timely and fun to read, you may have to 
skip your morning coffee so you don't miss anything.

Get ready, get set, get connected with eBiz.
