That's right; the dot is coming.  Prepare to be enlightened, entertained and 
engaged.  Prepare to receive information online that is so current, your 
mouse will be hiding under its mousepad.  Prepare to enter a brave new world 
of communication at Enron.  A world in which news is delivered so quickly you 
just might not be able to keep up.

A world in which we can rest easy that the information we need will be 
delivered with the speed and efficiency the Most Innovative Company in 
America deserves.

The dot is coming.  And it's bringing news you can use.  Now.
