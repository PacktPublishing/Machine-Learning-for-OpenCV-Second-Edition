Flood Relief in Massive floods in recent weeks have devastated much of the 
Mekong Delta in Vietnam, and as much help as possible
Vietnam is needed to help the millions of victims driven out by the natural 
disaster.  Thousands of people have died and the main 
 food source, rice, has been destroyed.  Homes and crops are not expected to 
recover until well after next year. Food, 
 water, and shelter are all in extremely short supply.  Every bit of help can 
make a huge difference!

 For information on how to support this important cause, contact Thu Pham 
Arnold at ext. 55125. Donations to 
 the flood relief can be made to:
 
 VCSA Flood Relief
 Vietnamese Culture & Science Association
 P.O. Box 741301
 Houston, TX 77247
