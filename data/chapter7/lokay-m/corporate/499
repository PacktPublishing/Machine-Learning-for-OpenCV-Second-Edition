Thursday, Feb. 22 at 10:00 am Houston time, join Charlene Jackson, managing 
director of the Associate/Analyst program, on eSpeak.  Charlene will host an 
"open-mike" event to answer your questions about this program.  If you can't 
make it to eSpeak for the live event, be sure to pre-submit your question(s) 
on the eSpeak site, and then read the transcript later for the answers.  

Note:  Please, please, please do not e-mail your questions to the eThink 
mailbox.  They must be submitted in the appropriate eSpeak event, or they 
won't get answered.


The hits just keep on coming!  Check out the latest ideas in the Idea Vault 
-- who knows, maybe one of them will make it into the Enron Xcelerator!  
Visit the ThinkBank today and make a deposit or a withdrawal.


Read the latest posting in the Office of the Chairman category.  And, don't 
forget:  There's an all-employee meeting on Wednesday, Feb. 21.  Any 
questions that don't get answered during the meeting will be addressed on 
eMeet.
