IVOLUNTEERI  
St. Joseph Hospital is looking for volunteers during the Neonatal Intensive 
Care Unit Reunion.  The reunion will give the staff, former patients and 
their families a chance to visit and allows the staff to view first-hand the 
success stories of their patients.  Volunteers are asked to assist with 
registration, set-up and decorations, games, snacks, photos, distribution of 
baseball caps and clean-up.  Your act of kindness will free-up the nursing 
staff so they can interact with the families.  To be a part of this special 
day, please contact Sue at 713-756-4009.
