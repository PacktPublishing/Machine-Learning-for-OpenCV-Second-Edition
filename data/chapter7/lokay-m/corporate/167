Sunday, November 5th, is the big day.  Although we have less than two weeks 
left, we still have several exciting fundraising activities taking place.  
All walkers should continue getting pledges and watch for further 
instructions on turning in the walk forms.  Everyone has done an incredible 
job this year.  Great news, we are getting very close to reaching our goal, 
but if we want to continue to be the number one walk team in Houston, we need 
to continue with our fundraising efforts.  Please plan to join us for the 
following activities this week:
 
Silent/Cyber Auction - The JDF Silent Cyber Auction will open for bids on 
Wednesday, October 25th, at 8:00 a.m. and will close on Thursday, October 
26th, at 4:00 p.m.  You may access the Cyber Auction to place your bids at 
8:00 a.m. on Wednesday, October 25th, by launching the website at 
http://ecinside.enron.net/apps/jdf.nsf  or go to the Enron home page on the 
Intranet and click on the JDF Cyber Auction.  For more information, contact 
Sophie Patel at ext. 35055 or Eddie Sera at ext. 30480.  

Bake Sale and Raffles - Just in time for the Holidays!  On Friday, October 
27th, we will have several groups selling delicious baked goods on the second 
floor level of the Enron Building outside the Energizer.  In addition, we 
will have representatives from some of our walk teams available for the 
purchase of raffle tickets at the same location.

For all that are not signed up, please join us in the walk.  You still have 
time.  It will take 2 minutes to fill out a walk form, you get a great 
Enron/JDF T-shirt for collecting or donating $25 or more, and will join 
hundreds of Enron employees and approximately 10,000 Houstonians for the walk 
on Sunday, November 5th, at the Sam Houston Race Park.  I promise this will 
be a blast.  The Enron tent will be great again this year!  We will begin 
with a continental breakfast prior to the walk and when everyone returns from 
the walk we will have music, balloons for the children and wonderful Frankie 
Mandola's hamburgers, hot dogs and fries.  Parking at the Sam Houston Race 
Park is free.  You will be part of something very worthwhile and it will make 
you feel great.  This is a world class event.

Please contact any of the following Steering Committee members to make a 
donation, sign up as a walker, or ask any questions you may have.  Come join 
the fun.
