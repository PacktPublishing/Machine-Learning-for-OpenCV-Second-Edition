We want to know what you think.

We all know that communication is one of Enron's core values.   We have 
introduced several new communication tools in the last year, like eThink and 
eBiz, that complement our more traditional methods of communicating, such as 
Enron Business (print and online) and face-to-face meetings.

The internal communications team would like you to take a few minutes and 
complete the following survey about the communication tools you find most 
effective.  Please give us your honest feedback about the tools and methods 
you use most often -- and tell us about the ones you don't use or need.

We appreciate your time.  Your feedback will help us tailor our communication 
efforts to better meet your needs.
