We want to hear from you!  The eThink Team is asking each Enron employee to 
submit one "Dream eSpeaker" suggestion for consideration to host an eSpeak 
session.

Is there someone outside of Enron that you feel would have a valid audience 
inside Enron?  Or, is there someone at Enron you think we have overlooked 
thus far?  

E-mail your eSpeak wish to ethink@enron.com.
