ched=20
and evaluated alternative Managed Services programs to determine which sour=
ce=20
would best meet our current and future needs in terms of quality, performan=

and cost containment objectives.  The Business Unit Implementation Project=

As a result of the team=01,s efforts, we are pleased to announce the beginn=
ing=20
of a strategic alliance with CORESTAFF=01,s Managed Services Group.  This g=

=20
The goal of our alliance with CORESTAFF is to make obtaining a temporary=20

We plan to implement Phase I of this improvement effective January 2, 2001.=
 =20
This Phase I of the implementation will encompass administrative/clerical=
=20
temporary workers at the Houston locations only. If you currently have=20
administrative/clerical temporary workers in your department, the enhanceme=
nt=20
will not affect their position. In an effort to preserve relationships, all=
=20
current staffing vendors will be invited to participate in this enhanced=20
program.  CORESTAFF shares our commitment to minimize any disruptions in=20
service during this transition.=20
=20
We expect to incorporate the administrative/clerical workers in Omaha,=20
Seattle and Portland in Phase II, which is scheduled for February, 2001.  T=
he=20
scope and timing of any additional phases will be determined after these tw=
o=20
phases have been completed.

Realizing the impact that the temporary workforce has in business today, we=
=20
selected CORESTAFF=01,s Managed Services Group based on their exceptional=
=20
management team, commitment to quality service, and creative solutions to o=
ur=20
staffing needs.  The relationship promises to offer Enron a cost effective=
=20
and simple means for obtaining temporary employees.

In the coming weeks, Enron and CORESTAFF=01,s Managed Services Group will b=
e=20
communicating to Enron=01,s administrative/clerical temporary staffing vend=
ors=20
about the new process. =20
