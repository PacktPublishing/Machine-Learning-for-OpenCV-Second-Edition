ETS Human Resources department is determining the feasibility of providing a 
retirement planning workshops for ETS employees.  By completing the following 
survey, you will provide us the information we need to determine the level of 
interest for this type of training.  If there is sufficient interest we will 
schedule these workshops around mid-December. 

Please complete the survey and return to Merlyn Fance by fax 713-646-3300 or

will be conducted by an outside Financial Planner.  This is not about an 
Enron Retirement package.
