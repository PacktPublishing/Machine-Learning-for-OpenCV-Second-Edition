This weekend marks the first employee move into our new office building, Enron Center South.

Approximately 400 Enron Global Markets employees will occupy the building's 3rd floor next Monday.  In the ensuing six weeks another 1,500 employees from Enron Industrial Markets, Enron Net Works, and our Power and Gas Marketers will follow, occupying levels 4, 5, and 6.

We know all employees are curious to experience this exciting new space.  HOWEVER, since Enron only has an occupancy permit for these specific floors, including limited access corridors from the skywalk, we ask that:

ONLY EMPLOYEES WHO ARE ASSIGNED OFFICE SPACE IN THE NEW BUILDING AND EMPLOYEES WITH STRICT BUSINESS NEEDS TO ACCESS OCCUPIED SPACE ARE PERMITTED TO BE IN THE NEW BUILDING.

Your compliance is appreciated and will assist in our ability to effectively conduct business by not over crowding newly occupied areas with visitors.  In addition, the balance of the building remains under construction and employees are strictly prohibited from entering these areas.

We are planning an open house in late Nov. or early Dec. so that every employee has the opportunity to see for themselves what is truly a world class commercial trading environment.  Thank you for your cooperation.
