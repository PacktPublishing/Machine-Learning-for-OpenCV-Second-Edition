The SDWT task force would like you to know that the web site is now up and 
running. Information pertaining to the task force will be updated on a 
continual basis. The web site address is 
http://www.ets.enron.com/services/SDWT/default.htm and hopefully the site 
will be available to meet your questions. 

Included in the web site is a listing of the current task force membership 
along with contact information. The site also includes the minutes of past 
meetings as well as links for performance management and the latest resources 
available to employees. The task force members would like to encourage you to 
utilize this resource and please feel free to contact the members for 
assistance and comments.

The task force is currently working on several objectives related to 
Self-Directed Work Teams. We are also continuing to assist in the EOTT 
transition. The task force is looking forward to serving ETS for the upcoming 
year, and please continue to communicate your concerns and comments to the 
members.


Sincerely,

The SDWT Communication Committee
