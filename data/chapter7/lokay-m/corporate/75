eMeetings are a hit!  John Keller's GPG Engineering & Construction group held 
the first eMeeting on Monday, August 7.  Within two hours, over 80 
participants from across the U.S. created a discussion with 150 postings.  
The eThink team is already working on features that will make eMeetings an 
even better communication tool.  Many thanks to John for suggesting we push 
the envelope with eMeet!
