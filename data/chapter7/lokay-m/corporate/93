You asked; we answered.  Many of you shared your ideas with us about what you 
think will make the New Peoplefinder a better information resource.  You 
suggested that we add aliases (AKAs) and fax, pager, and cell numbers.  We 
did.  Keep sending us your good ideas, click "Contact us" on peoplefinder.

Thanks for your support.
