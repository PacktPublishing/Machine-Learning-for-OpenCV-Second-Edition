The purpose of this memo is to inform you of organizational changes for ETS Pipeline Integrity Program Management.

Frank Osburn, Director of Facility and Operational Records, will move from Engineering and Construction to the Pipeline Integrity organization. Frank will bring the Document Control Team, the Mapping Team, and the Project Completion Team, as well as be responsible for Operational Compliance (Meagan Bange) and the PHD / PDMS group under Larry Abbott. We believe this entire group is critical to Pipeline Safety and Integrity and will help ensure consistent strategies.

Max Brown, currently Director of Corrosion and Risk Management, will add Pipeline Integrity Program responsibilities to his role. Max will add Ronny Davenport, Mike Ames, and John Millar to his Corrosion / Pipeline Integrity organization. This group will be working closely with the ETS Area VP's and Region Directors to ensure our Pipeline Integrity initiatives are communicated and on track. 

David Johnson will continue in the critical role as VP of Pipeline Safety, with Michael Crump as Director. The Pipeline Safety group will consist of Merlin Moseman, Pat Vaughan, and Lisa Choquette (RPT), with two Pipeline Safety Engineer vacancies currently open and posted.
