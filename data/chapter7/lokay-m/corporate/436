Enron Benefit Plans 
Summary Annual Report    

The basic financial and insurance information on the back of this page, as 
well as the material below, provide a Summary Annual Report for the Enron 
Benefit Plans.  The annual report for each plan has been filed with the 
Internal Revenue Service, as required by the Employee Retirement Income 
Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). 

NOTE:  You may receive a report for a benefit plan in which you are not a 
participant or under which you are not entitled.  Entitlement to benefits 
under any of the plans is based on the provisions of each plan.


Your Rights to Additional Information

You have the right to receive, upon request, a copy of the full annual 
report, or any part thereof, for any plan.  For insured plans, insurance 
information (including any sales commissions paid by insurance carriers) is 
shown in the annual reports.

To obtain a copy of the full annual report, or any part thereof, for any 
plan, write or call:

Enron Corp
1400 Smith Street
Houston, TX  77002-7311

You also have the right to receive from the plan administrator, on request 
and at no charge, a statement of the assets and liabilities of the plan and 
accompanying notes, or a statement of income and expenses of the plan and 
accompanying notes, or both.  If you request a copy of the full annual report 
from the plan administrator, these two statements and accompanying notes will 
be included as part of that report.

You also have the legally protected right to examine the annual report at the 
main office of the plan (Enron Corp., 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX  
77002-7311) and at the U.S. Department of Labor in Washington, D.C., or to
