As you are all aware, EBS has grown to be a significant part of Enron.  The=
=20
EBS/Blockbuster movies on-demand announcement this week, as Merrill Lynch p=
ut=20
it, =01&confirms the tremendous inroads Enron has made in the telecommunica=
tions=20
business.=018  We expect this deal to be a springboard for enabling EBS to=
=20
accomplish even greater things.

Because we believe that EBS is integral to Enron=01,s success, it is becomi=
ng=20
increasingly important for greater interaction among EBS senior management,=
=20
corporate leadership and our Houston-based business units.   In short, we=
=20
determined that it is necessary for the CEO to be based in Houston, althoug=
h=20
the Portland office will remain an integral part of EBS.=20

Joe Hirko as CEO and Ken Rice as Chief Commercial Officer have accomplished=
=20
great things, and we believe that both are completely qualified to fill the=
=20
CEO role moving forward.  However, Joe has decided to stay in Portland for=
=20
family reasons, and as a result, Ken will assume the role of CEO for EBS,=
=20
effective immediately. =20

Joe, unfortunately, has decided to leave Enron.  We want to recognize Joe f=
or=20
his role in making EBS a success.  He started the business, demonstrated it=
s=20
value to Enron management, and brought the team together to create the EBS=
=20
vision.

We do believe that EBS will continue to grow and succeed under Ken=01,s=20
leadership.  Throughout his 19-year career with Enron, he has consistently=
=20
been a driving force in building businesses.

Please join us in wishing both Joe and Ken great success.
