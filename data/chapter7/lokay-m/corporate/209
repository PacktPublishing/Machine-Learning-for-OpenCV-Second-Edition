HOLIDAY SAFETY REMINDER

The holiday season can mean an increased risk of fires and a higher potenti=
al=20
for criminal activity due to people taking advantage of convenient downtown=
=20
shopping and because of the increased number of special events and office=
=20
parties.  We would like to pass along a few safety and security tips from t=
he=20
City of Houston Fire Department and the Houston Police Department.

? Please do not prop open stairwell doors or doors to the freight elevators=
. =20
This defeats security.=20

? Use only artificial trees and greenery in decorating your office space. D=
o=20
not place cut trees or greenery within the building. Cut trees become major=
=20
fire hazards when they dry out.

? Office parties or the holiday mood may distract you.  Be alert for thieve=
s=20
who try to take advantage of the holiday season. Sometimes just having fewe=
r=20
people at work during the holidays creates an opening for thieves. If you s=
ee=20
someone that does not appear to belong in your work area, immediately call=
=20
the Enron Security Console at 713-853-5360.

? Keep your purse or wallet with you at all times or locked away in a drawe=
r=20
or closet.

? If you go shopping, invite a friend to go along. Try not to overload=20
yourself with packages.  When you return, lock your gifts away in a safe=20
place.

? Always be aware of your surroundings while in a public area. If things do=
n=01,
t look right, follow your instincts and avoid going into the area.

? When waiting for a ride home after hours, remain inside the building near=
 a=20
card-reader door until you see your ride arrive.=20

? If office parties are on company premises and involve alcoholic beverages=
=20
or public invitees, call security at 713-853-5360.  Security will advise yo=
u=20
as to company guidelines.
