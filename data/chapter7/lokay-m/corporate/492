On Thursday, February 22, 2001,  from 6:00 - 7:00 p.m.  the ETS QuickPlace 
server will be down for maintenance.   The maintenance is expected to last 
approximately 1 hour.

What does this mean to you?

Users who access the IdeaBank or any QuickPlace discussion sites (i.e.,  ETS 
Infrastructure, Program Office, ETS Standards, and FERC) will not be able to 
access them until the server has been brought back up.

If you have any concerns about this maintenance, please call us at:

 ETS Solution Center - Houston, at 713-345-4745
