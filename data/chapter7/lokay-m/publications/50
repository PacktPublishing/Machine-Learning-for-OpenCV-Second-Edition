We will see record numbers of new powerplants coming on line this year. New, much larger RTOs promise dramatic increases in liquidity. The Enron fallout will continue to force balance sheet improvements-- perhaps more mergers and acquisitions. Price volatility will continue, and risk management techniques will continue to be honed.
