Michelle,
Our True-Quote rep is Kelly Stroud at 713-350-1008.  If Jim wants to call
her to find out some info, he can tell her he got the number from Calpine.
I have only met Kelly Stroud a couple of times and she will remember me
because I was taking motorcycle classes when I met her and she used to ride
bikes.
Good Luck
Lisa
