One morning Dick Cheney and George W. Bush were having brunch at a
restaurant.

The attractive waitress asks Cheney what he would like and he replies, "I'll
have a bowl of oatmeal and some fruit."

"And what can I get for you, sir?" she asks George W.

He replies, "How about a quickie?"

"Why, Mr. President," the waitress says, "How rude . . . you're starting to
act like Mr. Clinton and you haven't even been in office for a month yet!"

As the waitress storms away, Cheney leans over to Bush and whispers, "It's
pronounced "quiche."
