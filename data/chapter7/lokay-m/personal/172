If I were you I would take Hwy 290 to Sam Houston Tollway, take beltway to I-45, then

take I-45 North and exit Kuykendahl - turn left under freeway and when you get to

light (not  feeder light) but approx one block later there will be the light @Kuykendahl - turn

right and stay on Kuykendahl all the way - you will pass the intersection at FM1960 and

then I think at the next light  or one after that is "WOERNER RD"  TURN RIGHT AND APPROX

1/2 BLOCK down you'll see sign on left "Shirley Acres" - its in the trees.....thats the place



See the red star above that is "Woerner Rd" and see where you exit off I-45 on Rankin/Kuykendalh exit,

go left under freeway and then turn right onKuykendahl....  You can come all the way down 1960 from Hwy 249

but thats a long slow trip with a lot of lights and traffic.....

Pray for sunshine and warm weather....

Caio bene'
