The following short quiz consists of 4 questions and will tell you
whether you are qualified to be a "professional."

Scroll down for each answer. The questions are NOT that difficult and
this won't take long at all.

previous actions.

Correct Answer:  The Elephant. The elephant is in the refrigerator.

This tests your memory.  OK, even if you did not answer the first three
questions correctly, you still have one more chance to show your true
abilities.

4.  There is a river you must cross. But it is inhabited by crocodiles.
How do you manage it?

Correct Answer: You swim across. All the crocodiles are attending the
Animal Meeting.

This tests whether you learn quickly from your mistakes.

According to Anderson Consulting Worldwide, around 90% of the
professionals they tested got all questions wrong. But many preschoolers
got several correct answers.

Anderson Consulting says this conclusively disproves the theory that
most professionals have the brains of a four year old. Send this out to
frustrate all of your smart friends.
