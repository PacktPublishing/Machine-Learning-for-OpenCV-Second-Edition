Thanks for your suggestions.  I forgot about you leaving at 4:30.  By girls
have both those movies.  At age 2, my girls could not sit down long enough
to watch a movie.  They would watch a few minutes at a time of Barney.

Sorry I wasn't here for your email last Friday...I try to leave by 4:30!!!
Yes, let's allget together soon...call me!

Jim and I did see some movies lately:  Men of Honor with Cuba Wadding Jr
was a good tear jerker, Charlie's Angel was humorous because we weren't
expecting much, and Bedazzled brought us back down to earth.  I would
recommend all three!  Meghan got some DVD's and her two favorite that she
watches every night are Toy Story 2 and Little Mermaid 2...have your girls
seen either one?

Subject:  Movie Suggestions


Hi Michelle,

How are you?  I was talking to Marilyn the other day.  We thought it would
be a good idea if we can try to get together one day.  Anyway, I haven't
asked you for movie suggestions since a long time.  I've seen "Perfect
Storm" and "The Patriot" .  Do you know of any others?  Or even if they are
still the theater ... I could add them to my future rental list.  Thanks.
