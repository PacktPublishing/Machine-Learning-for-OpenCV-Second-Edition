Revenue Generating:
Launched Transwestern capacity trading on EnronOnLine, with unlimited future revenue opportunities.  Executed daily firm transactions with ePrime, a new shipper, adding incremental $1000 in demand charges. 
Executed firm transport contract with Conoco at maximum tariff rate for 5 years,  generating $14 million in revenue.
Assisted in Red Rock expansion project.  Awarded capacity to Western, another new shipper, for 15 years; will generate $8 million in NPV revenue.  Capacity was also awarded to Oneok, for 2 years; generating $2 million in NPV revenue.
Contracted with North Star Steel for incremental firm service from their facilities to California border, adding $125,000 in demand charges plus additional 4.5% fuel collection.

Non-Revenue:
Completed new facility interconnect with Pogo for additional supply on east end of system.  Well was unfortunately dry and will not generate incremental revenue.
Liaison with Facility Planning to coordinate capacity, ROFR, expiration, and systems testing.
Coordinating with Operations and Market Services to monitor imbalances on OBAs to maximize financial impact.
