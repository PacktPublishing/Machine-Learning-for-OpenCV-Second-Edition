GOOD NEWS!!!!!
I contacted Schlitterbahn about a two-day ticket for next year and they told me that it is not well advertised but if you want a second-day ticket all you have to do is go to the admissions booth, show them your ticket for the current day or arm band and you will be able to purchase the second-day ticket for:  Adult $16.62, Child $12.07.  This is the only way you can get a reduced ticket for the second day.  Get the second-day ticket as you go in because the admission booth closes at 6 pm.  That is not all the second-day ticket can be used anytime, it does not have to be used the next day.
