> So God agreed (sigh).

> Monkey said, "How boring, monkey tricks for twenty years?  I don't think

> Dog gave you back ten, so that's what I'll do too, okay?"

> And God agreed again.

> On the fourth day God created man.

> God said, "Eat, sleep, play, have sex, enjoy. Do nothing, just enjoy,

> I'll give you twenty years."

> Man said, "What? Only twenty years? No way man. Tell you what, I'll take

> monkey gave back. That makes eighty, okay?" 
> 
> "Okay," said God. "You've got a deal." 
> 
> So that is why for the first twenty years we eat, sleep, play, have sex, 
> enjoy, and do nothing; for the next forty years we slave in the sun to 
> support our family; for the next ten years we do monkey tricks to
