Yes, it's the largest time of the year!  :)
===========================================

>I hate this time of year. Not for its crass commercialism and forced
frivolity, but because it's the season when the food police come out
with their wagging fingers and annual tips on how to get through the
holidays without gaining 10 pounds.
>
>You can't pick up a magazine without finding a list of holiday eating
do's and don'ts. Eliminate second helpings, high-calorie sauces and cookies
made with butter, they say. Fill up on vegetable sticks, they say.
>
>Good grief. Is your favorite childhood memory of Christmas a carrot
stick?  I didn't think so. Isn't mine, either. A carrot was something you
left for Rudolph.
>
>I have my own list of tips for holiday eating. I assure you, if you
follow them, you'll be fat and happy.
>
>So what if you don't make it to New Year's? Your pants won't fit
anymore,anyway.
>
>1. About those carrot sticks. Avoid them. Anyone who puts carrots on a
holiday buffet table knows nothing of the Christmas spirit. In fact, if
you see carrots, leave immediately. Go next door, where they're serving rum
balls.
>
>2. Drink as much eggnog as you can. And quickly. Like fine single-malt
scotch, it's rare. In fact, it's even rarer than single-malt scotch. You
can't find it any other time of year but now. So drink up! Who cares
that it has 10,000 calories in every sip? It's not as if you're going to
turn into an eggnogaholic or something. It's a treat. Enjoy it. Have one for
me.  Have two. It's later than you think. It's Christmas!
>
>3. If something comes with gravy, use it. That's the whole point of
gravy.  Gravy does not stand alone. Pour it on. Make a volcano out of your
mashed potatoes. Fill it with gravy. Eat the volcano. Repeat.
>
>4. As for mashed potatoes, always ask if they're made with skim milk or
whole milk. If it's skim, pass. Why bother? It's like buying a sports
car with an automatic transmission.
>
>5. Do not have a snack before going to a party in an effort to control
your eating. The whole point of going to a Christmas party is to eat
other people's food for free. Lots of it. Hello? Remember college?
>
>6. Under no circumstances should you exercise between now and New
Year's.  You can do that in January when you have nothing else to do. This
is the time for long naps, which you'll need after circling the buffet table
while carrying a 10-pound plate of food and that vat of eggnog.
>
>7. If you come across something really good at a buffet table, like
frosted Christmas cookies in the shape and size of Santa, position
yourself near them and don't budge. Have as many as you can before becoming
the center of attention. They're like a beautiful pair of shoes. You can't
leave them behind. You're not going to see them again.
>
>8. Same for pies. Apple. Pumpkin. Mincemeat. Have a slice of each. Or,
if you don't like mincemeat, have two apples and one pumpkin. Always have
three. When else do you get to have more than one dessert? Labor Day?
>
>9. Did someone mention fruitcake? Granted, it's loaded with the
mandatory celebratory calories, but avoid it at all cost. I mean, have some
standards, mate.
>
>10. And one final tip: If you don't feel terrible when you leave the
party or get up from the table, you haven't been paying attention. Reread
tips.  Start over.
>
>But hurry! Cookieless January is just around the corner.
