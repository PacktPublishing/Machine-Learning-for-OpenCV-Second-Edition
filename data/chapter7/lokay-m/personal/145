Michelle,

Thank you for your interest in our child care center! We do still have openings in our pre-school class at this time. If you are interested in obtaining an application, you can either pick one up from me at EB1633d or let me send one to you via intercompany mail. Let me know either way.

Regards,

Charla

OPEN ENROLLMENT FOR ENRON KIDS' CENTER IS UNDERWAY!!!

Want to be closer to your child during the workday?  Want to read to them at lunchtime or just give them a hug?  Then consider enrolling your child in the Enron Kids' Center.

Enron Kids' Center child care facility is currently under construction and will be located on Louisiana Street, across from our corporate headquarters in Houston. Enron is partnering with Knowledge Beginnings, one of the leaders in the child care industry, to provide high quality, conveniently located, customer service-oriented childcare for Enron employees in Houston. 


Anticipated opening date:	September 2001

Hours of operation:		The center will be open Monday through Friday from 7:00 AM - 6:30 PM. The center will be closed on all Enron holidays. In addition, special "parents' night out" care will be offered for occasions such as holiday shopping and night out at the movies for an additional fee.

Complete meal service:	Your child's breakfast, lunch and two snacks are included in tuition. Infants will need to bring their own food until they are ready for "table food".	

Eligibility:			Regular full-time or part-time Enron employees who are the parents or legal guardians of the child or children named on the application are eligible to enroll their children in the center.  Temporary employees, contract workers and non-custodial parents are not eligible to enroll their children in the child development center.
