It's not the same without your smiling face!!!!!!

I hope all is well for you and your family....how is that precious daughter
of yours?  I bet Meghan is really growing!!  (sorry, I probably mispelled
her name)

We miss you very much but so glad you found a new "home".....(ie work place)

I wanted to drop a line and say hello.....

I'm enjoying working at campus.  It's very nice being close to home and my
son's school.

Take care,
Sharee
