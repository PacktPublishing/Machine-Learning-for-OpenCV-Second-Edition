Here is the website.  Fiesta Flambeau parade is Saturday night; Battle of the Flowers parade is Friday at 12:45.  Aggie Band is in Friday's parade, Texas band in Saturday's.  The zoo is also having a deal on Saturday, and I will look for discount tickets for Fiesta Texas.http://www.fiesta-sa.org/ci/index.html  
Bring bathing suits too - our pool opens Saturday.
