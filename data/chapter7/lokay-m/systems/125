Joe, we would like to make an urgent request to have one of our staff persons 
added to our hotline number 18000.  We have discussed this request on 
numerous occasions, but have not been successful in any attempt.

Would you please, at this time, please arrange to have Michelle Lokay's 
extension, 57932, roll over to the hotline number, 18000.

When we spoke, you assured me that this would be handled.  Please call me on 
ext. 35849 if you have any questions regarding this request.

Again, we will need this handled today.

Thanks in advance for your assistance,
