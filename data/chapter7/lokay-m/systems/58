eSource Launches eSearch Site Bringing Research to Your Desktop


eSource, Enron's premier research group, launched their new product, eSearch, 
on December 8, 2000. 

eSource's team of specialized researchers have created a web site to bring 
information and research to every employee's desktop.  The eSearch web site 
offers many links to information resources, access to research databases, 
specialized searches, sites to purchase books, articles, and reports, and 
training.  Employees can use the web site to conduct their own research or as 
a vehicle to submit research requests.  eSource's researchers and industry 
specialists are available to all Enron business units to provide timely and 
cost efficient research, to work with individuals or groups to fulfill one 
time research requests, or to design ongoing, customized monitoring projects 
or news updates.


The preferred browser is Internet Explorer

Join us for a demonstration and training session on Friday, December 15th at 
1:00-1:30 and 2:00-2:30 in room EB5C2.
