In mid-January, we are going to begin the next phase of the Windows=20
2000/Outlook Migration Projects.  In the first phase, we gathered informati=
on=20
about the hardware and software that you are using within your group.  We a=
re=20
now in the process of testing any applications that have not been previousl=
y=20
tested with Windows 2000.

The migration will happen in groups.  The Migration Leader will work with t=
he=20
Point of Contact for your group to set up a date for your group to be=20
migrated to Windows 2000 and Outlook.  Before your group can migrate, we mu=
st:
? select convenient migration dates
? assure that all applications have been tested
? order and receive any necessary hardware
? arrange for necessary Windows 2000 and Outlook training

We will also send (via email) further information on features and other=20
migration considerations regarding ETS=01, scheduled conversion from Lotus =
Notes=20
to Microsoft Outlook.  This conversion will coincide with the Windows 2000=
=20
operating system (OS) upgrade.  Microsoft Outlook 2000 integrates more=20
effectively with the Windows 2000 OS and other Microsoft products.  Further=
,=20
it provides a more robust mail platform. =20

To prepare for the migration effort, we advise that you take a few minutes =
to=20
do some data housekeeping.   As we move to the new environment, there will =
be=20
mailbox size limits enforced.  We encourage you to review your Notes folder=
s=20
to eliminate any unnecessary files.  Also, you might want to review your da=
ta=20
files, in both your work directory and any common directories you use, to=
=20
assure you still have a need for them.   As you review these files, you=20
should assure that you're retaining only business-related files.

We look forward to this exciting, beneficial effort.  You will be receiving=
=20
more communications soon.  However, if you have any questions in the=20
meantime, please give us a call.
