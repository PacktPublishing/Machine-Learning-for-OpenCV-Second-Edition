Effective Monday, January 7, 2002, Dynegydirect will institute a "new look"
on our Trade Floors. The new look will have ACTIVE and INACTIVE markets
designated with green and red lights to the right of the product line.

Upon opening your individual Trade Floor/Window the window may not contain
the usual number of products. You have two choices to make:

                                 Choice 1:
A "SHOW ALL MKTS" button will be on the upper right of the screen. If you
check this, all the markets you have saved in your trading window(s) will
appear, just as they always have, whether the markets are ACTIVE or
INACTIVE. You will not see the green and red lights to the right of the
product line.
                                 Choice 2:
If you do not check the "SHOW ALL MKTS" button, the window may be blank
until Dynegy begins posting prices and volumes and a "REFRESH" button
appears on the top center of the window. Clicking on the "REFRESH" button
will enable ACTIVE markets, which will be indicated by a GREEN light to the
right of the product line. The light will remain GREEN for 30 seconds after
activation.

The "REFRESH" button will reappear as additional markets become ACTIVE or
as an existing market becomes INACTIVE. When Dynegy places a product on
hold (INACTIVE market) the price and volume will disappear and a RED light
will appear to the right of the product line after 15 minutes of
inactivity.

Clicking on the "REFRESH" button will add all ACTIVE markets and/or remove
all INACTIVE markets.


ADDITIONAL NOTE:
Any new Trading Windows you create from Monday forward will default to
Choice 2.
