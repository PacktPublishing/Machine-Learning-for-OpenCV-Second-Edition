Over the next few weeks, Project Apollo and Beyond will conduct its final SAP 
implementation.  This implementation will impact approximately 12,000 new 
users plus all existing SAP users. SAP brings a new dynamic to Enron, 
enhancing the timely, appropriate flow of financial, project, procurement, 
and human resources information within and across business units and around 
the world.

For help as SAP goes live for you:
Go to http://sap.enron.com for old to new coding references, SAP forms.  See 
example web paths and SAP coding contacts at the bottom of this note.
During the first few weeks, contact SAP support personnel that will be on 
site at various field locations, in Houston and Omaha.  
Call the SAP help desk at (713)345-4SAP. Depending on the issue, they will 
solve it on the spot, or log it and follow-up.
Call (713)853-1555 if you are still having difficulty.  Some of the same 
folks who have been supporting you over the years on MSA and DSS will be 
available to work with you to ensure that your issues are addressed.
