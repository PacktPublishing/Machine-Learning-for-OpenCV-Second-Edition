What does this all mean for you after July 1, 2000?

New SAP Coding for everyone
 This includes all new General Ledger Accounts, Workorder numbers and Cost 
Centers.  Company numbers have now been expanded to four positions.
 
All departments have been assigned a new SAP Cost Center number 
 A new SAP Company/Cost Center must be used to request Houston Office 
internal services such as:
   Forms & Stationary   
  Overnight Deliveries (Fed Ex, UPS, etc.)
  Audio/Visual Services
  TAP - Travel Agency in the Park
  A/C Lighting after hours
