Some of you have had problems with this months newsletter - sorry.  The 
system we normally use to create it on was down and even though this one was 
compatible with the group I test with, it did not work well with everyone.  
If you have trouble viewing or printing the format, or just prefer another 
format, I have 2 other versions I can send you.  Just reply to this note or 
call me at 713-853-3986.  If the majority have problems and another version 
works, I'll resend it to the whole group.  For the moment, I'll keep working 
one-on-one.  

Thanks,
Donna
