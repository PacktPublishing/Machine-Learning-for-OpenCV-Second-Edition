Subject: socket vs tibco


Yesterday's meeting concluded that real time fuel project should use socket 
to communicate
wtih SCADA to be in sync with other real time application in the group. 
Steve Littel sent his VB codes to me and I am working on it.

I asked Joe Zhou about TW Deal Analysis on Window 2000.  He said there should 
be no problem.
Window 2000 should have IE 5.0 features.
