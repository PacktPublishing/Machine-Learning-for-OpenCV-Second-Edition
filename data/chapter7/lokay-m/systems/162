Important Instructions for Sending in Expense Reports:

?	Prepare your expense report. 

?	Once completed, click on the print button at the top. 

?	A box requesting you to select the appropriate type of report will be displayed.  Select either Receipt Report or Detail Report based on the following specifications:

1.	Receipt Report - This report must be printed and sent to accounting. This report has a bar code on it that is needed for the accounting department to scan in your report. It also tells you which receipts must be sent in with the receipt report. 

2.	Detail Report - Do not send this report to accounting (it has no bar code).  This report is more appropriate for the traveler or the person that prepares the report in case they would like to keep a paper copy. 


?	Once you have printed the receipt report and attached the receipts, you must send all expense reports in the white A/P envelope with the open slot at the right hand corner (the bar code must be seen through this slot). 


**If you follow these instructions when sending in your expense reports, the receipts will be scanned much more quickly.  If you do not use the correct envelope or do not send the correct report, it will significantly slow down the process.
