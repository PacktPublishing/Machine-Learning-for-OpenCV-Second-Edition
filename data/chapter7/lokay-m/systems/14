Michelle -- I am glad they finally fixed your name!   

You need to go under "Actions", Calendar Tools", "Calendar Profile" and under 
mail file owner go out to the address book and reselect your name.    

Page me if you have any questions.    Thanks, Jean 1-800-906-8093

Subject: Michelle Lokay Name Problem

The notes team has corrected her name from Michele to Michelle.  But as you 
can see in her letter head it still come up as Michele.
How do we change that.  I've reset up her notes from scratch to see if that 
corrected the problem.  
For the long run - should we just get corrected ID file from the Notes Team?
