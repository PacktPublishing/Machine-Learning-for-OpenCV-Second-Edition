Hi Jean.

Please review the message below from Michele Lokay.  Her Lotus Note address 
appears to be included in the "All Omaha Office Employees" listing.

Thank you!

Hi Julie,
I just started with the Transwestern group in Houston and am getting all 
these emails for Omaha.  You guys sure have a lot of fun; but can you take me 
off the distribution list?  Thanks!
