WinInstall Will Run on Friday

A WinInstall screen will appear during your login on Friday, January 12, 
2001.  

WinInstall will then make updates to your computer including:
McAfee anti-virus software update

The WinInstall process will take approximately 1 minute to complete.  A bar 
showing percentage of completion is displayed during the process.  Please 
note that during the update, you should not disturb the machine.  Doing so 
will only slow the update.

If you have any questions, please call the GPG Solution Center

                        ET&S Help Desk - 713-345-GPG5
