You can install the TW Map program via these instructions:

Got to the "Start" button -> Programs -> Standard Applications -> Winstall 
for Other Apps.

After winstall loads, scroll down in the "Available Applications" windows 
until you see
"TW Map #1". 

Click once on the "TW Map #1" then on "Install".

Click on "OK" then on the "Exit" button to close Winstall.

You should see an ICON on your desktop labeled "TW Map".  Another application 
should appear
under "Start" -> Programs -> TW Production Apps -> TW Map.
