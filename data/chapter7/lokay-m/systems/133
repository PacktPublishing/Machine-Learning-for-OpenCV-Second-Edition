Subject:  Omaha Helpdesk Consolidation

We are pleased to announce that effective immediately we are consolidating=
=20
the two Omaha Infrastructure teams into one team that supports Enron=01,s T=
wo=20
Pacific Place office building in Omaha.  We believe this consolidation will=
=20
provide all Enron employees in Omaha better support in a more efficient=20
manner.  This new team will continue to work with the Houston ETS=20
Infrastructure team to implement the ETS standard across companies and citi=
es.

Joe Palik will lead the new team.  Joe and the team will be responsible for=
=20
all the day-to-day operations relating to help desk calls, desktop support,=
=20
and Infrastructure support.  Joe will have a dual reporting role to both To=
ny=20
Mayer and Bob Martinez.=20

Jean McFarland is moving into full-time project management, reporting to Bo=
b=20
Martinez.  In the near-term, in addition to her project work, Jean will=20
remain accessible to her current customers and Joe and his team to help in=
=20
this transition.

Until the completion of the Omaha Windows 2000 and Exchange implementation,=
=20
Mike Guzman and Tommy Sellers will be spending the majority of their time o=
n=20
this project reporting to Jean.  Jean will continue to have responsibility=
=20
for this and other key ETS projects currently in progress or planned for=20
2001.  Diane Becker will continue to work on the Windows 2000 Security item=
s=20
along with her help desk responsibilities.

Once the Windows 2000 project is complete, reporting to Joe will be:

 Infrastructure Platform:  Helpdesk/Desktop:
 Mike Guzman (W2K)    Karen Melton
 Mike Rasmussen  Diane Becker
 Tyler Theobald ,  Randy Lukken
Dan Bunch
       Ed Wojcik
     Tommy Sellers , (W2K)

The first step in this merger will be to combine the help desks and move to=
 a=20
common help desk call system.  Once this is complete, we=01,ll initiate=20
cross-training activities in the desktop support area, allowing these suppo=
rt=20
functions to be shared.=20

Please congratulate Jean and Joe on their new responsibilities and work wit=
h=20
them to ensure a smooth transition to one support team for Omaha.  If you=
=20
have any questions or concerns, please contact one of us, Bob Martinez, or=
=20
Tony Mayer.  Thank you for your cooperation.
