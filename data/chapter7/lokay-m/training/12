Most people want to work well with others.  But most were raised in families 
where conflict did not bring them closer.  We come to work with two habitual 
ways of dealing with difficult relationships -- to attack or to withdraw.  We 
tend to avoid addressing differences with our co-workers and especially with 
our supervisors.  Information is not shared, dangers are not discussed, and 
mistakes are ignored.  The individual can become overwhelmingly stressed.  
The organiziation suffers loss of respect and trust and risks financial 
loss.  The Successful Working Relationships seminar series provides a range 
of practical tools and techniques that will help you build a more supportive 
environment in which you will actually look forward to working each day.  


Successful Working Relationships - Valuing Differences
October 3, 2000    8:30am -4:30pm  in  EB552    $600.00 

Organizations are like "step-families".  People come together with different 
backgrounds, perceptions, and preferences.  These different habits of 
attitude and behaviour can be the sources of much confusion and frustration.  
Using a unique approach to the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) through 
entertaining examples and informative exercises, this program teaches the 
strengths inherent in the various personality types. This module emphasizes 
the importance of not being pigeonholed in any particular category, but 
rather developing your own full range of potential.


Successful Working Relationships - Creating Understanding
November 3, 2000    8:30am -4:30pm  in  EB552    $450.00

People will tolerate a disagreement whey they feel understood but will not 
tolerate not be misunderstood.  Respect occurs when co-workers are able to 
eliminate misunderstandings and successfully resolve conflicts - together.  
Using a unique and powerful approach this module will help you actually 
reduce the resistance of others to your point of view.
