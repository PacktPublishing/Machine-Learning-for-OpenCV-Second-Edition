We continue our salute to the ETS employees nominated for the 2000 Chairman's Award. This week, please join me in congratulating:

Bob Martinez
Johnny McGee
Corrine Miller
Jim Nelson

Bob, director of non-IT development in Houston, is a highly revered person. He goes above and beyond the call of duty to treat others with respect at work and outside of work. Bob is well respected by his teammates and coworkers.

Johnny, director of right-of-way in Houston, sets the pace for the pack to follow. He can follow, but he is also a great leader. He shows that we can be more than we are if only we believe and trust our business sense. While setting goals, he wants you to succeed and is an encourager. Johnny is the type of person who thinks it is better to be well done than well said.

Corrine, senior project coordinator in Omaha, was a crucial part of the new accounting/ management reporting system (SAP). In her commitment to excellence and desire to make Enron the best it can be, Corrine worked many long hours to assure the project cost issues were given high priority during development and implementation.

Jim, senior tech O&M in Willmar, MN, shows invaluable integrity as a Willmar team member and an Enron employee. He provides excellent quality customer service. While responding to some tense issues of customer/company relations, Jim acted very professional and followed up to all questions and concerns of both Enron and the customer. Jim always carries a greeting smile and a waiting handshake.

Again, please join me in congratulating Bob, Johnny, Corrine and Jim.
