To date, ETS has raised $297,940.00, which is 86% of our goal of $346,000.  If you've given to the United Way, THANK YOU for your contribution.  

If you haven't made your contribution to the United Way, please log on to home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com> today.  Today is your last chance to make your United Way pledge.

Every employee who makes or who has made a contribution at the Make a Difference level will be eligible for a drawing to receive one of three Dinner for Two Gift Certificates from Caf? Annie valued at $200.00 each.  The drawing will be held at 8:30 am, Thursday, August 23 and the three lucky winners will be notified by 10:00 am.

To make a contribution at the Make a Difference level, employees with a base salary of $90,000 or below contribute .06% of their base salary.  Employees with a base salary greater than $90,000 contribute 1.2% of their base salary.

Thank you for your generosity and for working with the United Way to change lives right here in our community.

Stan
