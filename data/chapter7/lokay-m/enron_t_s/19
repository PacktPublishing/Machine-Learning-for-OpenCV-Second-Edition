Why are we doing this?
In the spirit of the One GPG campaign, we are consolidating all of the GPG=
=20
Intranet sites to present a common look and feel by leveraging the latest w=
eb=20
technology.  This effort will reduce the cost to maintain these sites and=
=20
servers.

How will it affect me as a user? As a user you will be able to search the G=
PG=20
Intranet, create your own myGPG.com page and update content you are=20
responsible for whenever you need.

=01(.as a Webmaster?
By utilizing Content Management tools, Webmasters will be able to focus on=
=20
development efforts.  Standards will be put in place regarding navigation,=
=20
graphics, content and performance.  Tools will be available to check the=20
performance and usage of your site.

What are the next steps?
The Intranet team will be contacting Webmasters with content on the current=
=20
GPG website (www.ots.enron.com) to discuss the migration.  All content on t=
he=20
existing web server will be moved to the new GPG Intranet.

What is the future direction?
The initial rollout will include the migration of the existing GPG site=20
(www.ots.enron.com), content management of that information and the=20
myGPG.com. =20

Meetings will be setup with each operating company's Webmaster to discuss=

timelines for integrating the remaining web servers into the new environmen=
