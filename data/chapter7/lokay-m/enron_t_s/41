We plan to post the following notice Friday, November 3 or Monday, November 
6, concerning a potential expansion of the TBPL point.  

We will also be publicizing this notice in Gas Daily and will be sending a 
letter to a few customers that bring in gas on TBPL now and plan to be part 
of the TBPL expansion.

Let me know if you have questions.  My phone number is 398-7707.
