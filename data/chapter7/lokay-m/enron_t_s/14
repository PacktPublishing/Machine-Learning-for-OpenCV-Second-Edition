  GPG and EOTT Operations have joined together to explore the idea of 
combining the technical services and field operations of the two groups in 
order to reduce costs and capture available synergies.

 We will be spending the next 30 days or so evaluating the pros and cons of a 
combination, including the accounting, legal and human resources implications 
of such a partnership.  We will keep you up-to-date as efforts move forward.
