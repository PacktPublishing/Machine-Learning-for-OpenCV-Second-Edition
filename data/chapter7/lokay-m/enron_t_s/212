Hopefully, by now, you've heard about ETS: The Next Generation on Monday, April 2.  

Here are the details you've been waiting for:

2:00 p.m - ETS Employee Meeting at the Hyatt Downtown in the Exhibit Hall and Omaha Room 227 - please note the change in meeting time.  

All ETS employees are encouraged to attend this meeting to hear what's going on across ETS from our Leadership Team.  This meeting will be like no other, so be sure to come!  

The meeting will be video streamed to Omaha in room 227 for employees to gather there.  

Houston employees, after the meeting, please connect with your family and head to the Museum of Fine Arts.

4:30 - 7:30 p.m. - ETS Reception for employees and their families.

Please join me and my family at Star Wars: The Magic of Myth at the Museum of Fine Arts, Audrey Jones Beck Building, as we celebrate our ETS successes and Rock Meyer's Enron career.  

At the reception you and your family will enjoy the infamous Star Wars exhibit hassle-free with no long lines and no time limits while you're viewing the exhibit.  You'll also have the opportunity to wish Rock Meyer and his family all the best as they head for Arizona.

On top of that, we'll have great food and beverages, crafts for the kids, raffle prizes and a few surprises!   

With free parking connected to the museum via the tunnel, you'll have spare change to spend in the Star Wars gift shop!  Kids of all ages are welcome, including ones in strollers. 

So, please click below to RSVP for the reception and bring your family to enjoy a magical night at the museum.

I look forward to seeing our full "FORCE" on April 2 at the employee meeting as well as at the reception.
