It is a special pleasure to announce that Steve January has been promoted to Senior Director, effective immediately.
Steve's promotion is well-earned recognition of his significant impact on Gas Control, Market Services and ETS.  His 28 years of operations, pipeline dispatch and scheduling experience, as well as his credibility with our customers and other ETS and Enron business units influenced the ETS Management Committee's decision to promote him.
Please join me in congratulating Steve.
