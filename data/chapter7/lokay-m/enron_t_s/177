eProcurement

Today marks the launch of the iBuyit eProcurement tool within Enron Transportation Services.  While many employees are using eProcurement through the B2B procurement tool, starting today, employees throughout ETS should utilize the iBuyit eProcurement tool to purchase O&M expense materials, office supplies, IT hardware and both fleet and capital work order material.  

Using iBuyit is a milestone in the Enron-wide cost saving effort.  This new tool will enable us to monitor and analyze our expenses and enhance our value with preferred suppliers, as well as help us control costs more effectively.   

The iBuyit eProcurement tool also has the potential for unlimited growth when partnered with the ETS Procurement organization, the GSS organization and good business sense.    

As you use iBuyit, please provide Morris Brassfield and the iBuyit team feedback to ensure that the eProcurement tool becomes and remains a valuable and integral part of our purchasing activities.

Please visit the iBuyit portal to logon to iBuyit eProcurement to access training information and materials and learn more about Enron's business-wide cost savings opportunities: <http://ibuyit.enron.com>.  To logon enter your User ID (P number) and Password (initial password is ENRON1).

If assistance is needed, please contact your trainer or call the ISC Customer Care line at 713.345.4727.
