I am extremely pleased to announce that Jo Williams has accepted the position 
as Director of the Pricing & Structuring group!  Jo's business instincts, 
decision-making skills and overall management experience are an asset for our 
marketing effort.  She will be helping to lead and organize our efforts to 
provide centralized pricing and structuring and to coordinate our deal 
inventory as well as supporting our Risk Management and Reporting group.

Jo received her Bachelor of Science Degree in Civil Engineering from the 
University of Nebraska at Lincoln and Master of Science Degree in Economics 
from the University of Nebraska at Omaha.  She began her career with the 
company in 1979 with the engineering and operations group.  In 1991 she was 
promoted to Director of Technical Operations for Northern Plains, and in 1994 
moved to Northern Natural Gas as Director of Technical Services.  Jo has 
spent the last 1 1/2 years working with the Business Management and Pricing 
and Structured Products teams for the ET&S marketing group.

We are excited to have Jo as the Director of the Pricing & Structuring group 
and invite you to give her a call to congratulate her!
