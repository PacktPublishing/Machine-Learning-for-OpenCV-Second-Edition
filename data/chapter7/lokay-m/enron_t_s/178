Earlier in the month, ETS IT employees and Enron Networks employees were presented the Gold Sponsorship Award at the Texas State Wide Summer Games for Special Olympics held in Arlington. Enron employees were given this award for their donation of time, as well as their ongoing support of the Guardian System and Special Olympics.  

The Guardian System, originally created by EDS and now supported by Enron employees, keeps scoring information and medical records, and other information on the athletes and the games. The system is now being used in other states besides Texas and is being considered for possible future use in the upcoming Special Olympics World Games. 

ETS IT employees Matthew Parchem, Ahmad Mousselli, Mike Dervin and James Regan provide technical expertise for the Guardian System, while walking with the project leader, Roger Fernandez of Enron Networks.

Karon O'Gorman, also an ETS IT employee, works with vendors to gather donations for computer equipment to be used during the games and coordinates safe and timely delivery of the equipment. 

This award given to ETS IT employees exemplifies the excellence and integrity we value at ETS and Enron. Congratulations!
