Jim Prentice, President of Enron Clean Fuels, was recently honored by Child Advocates, Inc. with the Hero Sword award.

The Hero Sword is the highest honor bestowed upon donors, supporters or volunteer leaders of Child Advocates, Inc.  This award was presented to Jim in recognition of his outstanding leadership as Chairman of the BP Houston Children's Festival for the past three years, raising more than $1 million to support the efforts of Child Advocates Inc.  Jim has been involved with Child Advocates since 1996.

"Jim truly is deserving of this award, as it is symbolic of his efforts in slaying the dragons of child abuse, making him a hero to the many children whose lives he changed for the better," said Tony Terwilliger, manager of special events for Child Advocates, Inc.

Congratulations Jim.
