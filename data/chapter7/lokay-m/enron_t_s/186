A message from my friends at Channel 8.
-----------------------------------------------------------
An FYI from HoustonPBS/Channel 8:

I have had a couple of calls regarding airing of the PBS documentary
"Blackout" on tonight's Frontline program.

Due to our pledge schedule, Frontline will not air in the regular 9:00 p.m.
timeslot.  Instead, Channel 8 will air Frontline at 10:00 p.m. tonight
(Tuesday, June 5).

A second airing of " Blackout" is scheduled for Tuesday, June 12th in
Frontline's regular timeslot at 9:00 p.m. We apologize that these changes
were not made in time for publication.

I know this program is of interest to many of the firms in EWI, especially
our energy companies, so I wanted to give you a heads up regarding the
correct air times so you have a chance to let your executives know of the
time change.

Please pass the information on to all interested parties in your company.

Frontline "Blackout" airs:

Tuesday, June 5, 2001 at 10:00 p.m. CST
Tuesday, June 12, 2001 at 9:00 p.m. CST


Thanks,
