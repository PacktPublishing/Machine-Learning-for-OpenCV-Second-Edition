Danny has mentioned that he will make phone calls to any of our customers that we think may be concerned about the Enron situation and how it may impact the ongoing business of Transwestern.  Please pull together a list of customers (ASAP since Danny will be out of the office tomorrow) that you think need a personal phone call from Danny.  Audrey has volunteered to combine our lists for us, so please submit the customer, name of contact, title and phone number to her within the next couple of hours.  

Thanks, Kim.
