	ETS Intranet Consolidation Project Updates (www.ETS.enron.com)
What is the status of the consolidation?

Completed Sites:
The core ETS Intranet Site, www.ets.enron.com
ETS Solution Center 
http://www.ets.enron.com/Services/Solution_Center/default.htm
Self-Directed Task Force http://www.ets.enron.com/Services/SDWT/default.htm

Sites in Progress:
Safety Site http://www.ots.enron.com/safety/default.htm
Design and Records Management
Engineering Standards http://www.ots.enron.com/docs/stds/0000-1.htm

How will this consolidation affect me as a user? As we roll out new sites, 
any bookmarks to the old sites will need to 
be modified.  If you navigate to an old site, you will see a redirect message 
requesting that you update your bookmarks and a link to the new site.

What are the next steps?
The Intranet team will be contacting Webmasters with content or applications 
on the current ETS website (www.ots.enron.com)
to discuss the migration.  All content and applications on this web server 
will be moved to the new ETS Intranet before the end of the 2nd quarter.
