Thank you for your commitment to the United Way.   

By raising $301,386, ETS reached a milestone in contributions.  We also set a record for participation, with 94.8% of our employees giving generously to the United Way.

Congratulations to our Make a Difference contributors Sheila Nacey, Mark Adleman and Amy Krone for winning Dinner for Two at Cafe Annie.  Each of these winners will receive a $200 Cafe Annie gift certificate.

Again, thank you for supporting the United Way and for believing that ETS can make a difference right here in our community.
