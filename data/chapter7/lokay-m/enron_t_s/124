Thank you for your participation in the Pulse survey this past October.  We=
=20
achieved our highest response rate ever, with more than 1,400 ETS employees=
=20
(63%) participating in this important feedback process.=20

The survey results, too, are very encouraging.  Most elements improved and=
=20
ETS=01, strengths continue to be in the area of our employees, just as Enro=
n as=20
a whole has been recognized by Fortune magazine for our employees and=20
management.  ETS received high marks from employees for the following areas=
:

 =01  People are treated with respect and dignity - 76%
 =01  Information from management is believable - 74%
 =01  Supervisors deal fairly with everyone - 72%
 =01  Teamwork is encouraged - 71%
 =01  Employee benefits are satisfying - 68%
 =01  ETS is well-managed - 66%

I am pleased with these results, because I believe they exhibit a strong=20
belief in Enron=01,s core values, Respect, Integrity, Communication and=20
Excellence.  These results are indicative of the quality of ETS employees a=
t=20
all levels.

In this recent survey, just as in 1999, workload was a concern, with 39=20
percent of survey participants saying they believed they did not have enoug=
h=20
time to complete all of the work required of them.  While we have made some=
=20
strides at alleviating this concern as compared to the December, 1999 and=
=20
June, 1999 surveys, I believe that we can do better still by shifting=20
resources as business needs change, eliminating unnecessary work and more=
=20
effectively using technology.  I would also encourage you to consider the=
=20
variety of training and development offerings available in the areas of=20
workload planning and management. =20

You also voiced concerns with communication across departments.  I take you=
r=20
concerns very seriously and will ensure that ETS focuses on further=20
improvements in this area.

Even beyond this survey, I continue to be interested in your thoughts on=20
improving the ETS organization.   Please feel free to send me your ideas vi=
a=20
e-mail or interoffice mail.  You can also send your ideas to Gary Smith, Vi=
ce=20
President of Human Resources or to any of the ETS management team.

The Pulse enables us to focus on real issues affecting each employee, so yo=
ur=20
continued participation is critical to its success.  I hope you will choose=
=20
to be a part of future surveys, the next of which is scheduled for the fall=
=20
of 2001. Your input is essential in creating and shaping ETS to be the best=
=20
it can be.

Thank you again for participating in the 2000 Pulse survey.
