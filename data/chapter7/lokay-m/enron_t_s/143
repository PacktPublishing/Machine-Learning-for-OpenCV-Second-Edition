From the Desk of Steve Kirk:


It is a pleasure to announce that Michele Winckowski will transfer from Certificates & Reporting to Rates & Tariffs effective September 1.  Michele replaces Ranelle Paladino who will transfer to the Pricing Desk in Northern's Business Development and Marketing Division.

Michele's Enron experience spans 22 years, starting as an Integrator Operator.   Over the next 10 years, she moved into various administrative and accounting positions where she gained experience in disbursements, property accounting and financial planning.  She joined the Regulatory Affairs Division in 1989 as a Regulatory Analyst.  Over the next 12 years, she developed additional expertise in the Cost-of-Service and Certificates areas, which prompted a promotion to Sr. Regulatory Analyst in 1993.  Her strong accounting and regulatory background will be a real asset to the Rates & Tariffs Deaprtment .

We look forward to Michele's transfer and the strengths she brings to her new position.
