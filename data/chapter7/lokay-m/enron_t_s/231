Due to a scheduling conflict, Mark Frevert will not be able to speak at the ETS floor meeting on the 41st floor tomorrow.

Greg Whalley, President and COO of Enron Wholesale Services, will be our guest speaker. 

Greg will be informing us of what is currently happening within EWS, as well as answer any questions you have.

Please join us tomorrow, Thursday, February 1, at 2:00 pm by the Fax Center on 41.

I look forward to seeing you there.

Danny J. McCarty
