Once again, it's time to find out what you think about your work experience=
=20
at Enron and Enron Transportation Services Company, and what we can do to=
=20
help make it better.  That's why we want to check your pulse.  In fact, we'=
ve=20
changed the name of last year's "Excellence Through Communication" employee=
=20
survey to The Pulse.  We believe The Pulse more accurately captures the=20
purpose of the survey.  Your diagnosis will help us correct problem areas s=
o=20
we can continue to make Enron a great place to work.

2. We will respond actively to your comments.  We are going to do our best =
to=20

ones.  We may ask for your help in resolving some of the issues that are=20
collected in the survey - your active role will help us identify the best=
=20
solutions.
In last year's survey, you identified several problem areas regarding=20
internal communications, workload and performance management. We've already=
=20
acted on many of your recommendations.  These are a few of the things we've=
=20
accomplished in direct response to your input:

=01  ETS strengthened management focus on intellectual capital and employee=
=20
through the initiation of:
=01  Table Talk sessions with ETS Office of the Chairman, which give employ=
ees=20
the opportunity to have frontline discussions,
=01  The "Innovation Series," which invites employees to share their ideas=
=20
openly and ensures management commitment to evaluating ideas,
=01  E-Speak sessions with ETS leaders to exchange ideas, and
=01  Our name change to Enron Transportation Services to recognize our most=
=20
strategic asset - you.

=01  We made workload planning and management training/development availabl=
e to=20
ETS employees to address workload issues, the greatest ETS concern in the=
=20
survey.

=01  We improved the consistency of performance management, the survey topi=
c=20
that received the most employee comments, by extending the use of the=20
Performance Evaluation Process (PEP) system and the Performance Review=20
Committee (PRC) process to all levels in ETS at mid-year in 2000.
