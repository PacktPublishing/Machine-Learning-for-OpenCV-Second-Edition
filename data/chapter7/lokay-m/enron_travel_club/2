The Alley Theatre presents 

"Art"
(By Ysmina Reza)

This international comedy sensation chronicles the hilarious events surrounding the purchase of a contemporary painting for a huge amount of money.  Yasmina Reza's clever comedy ran for over a year at the Comedie des Champs-Elysees in Paris and has already garnered the Moliere Award for Best Play, Olivier Award for Best Comedy, Evening Standard Award for Best New Comedy, as well as a Tony and New York Critics Award for Best Play.  "A remarkably wise, witty, and intelligent comedy - ART has touched a universal nerve,"  wrote The New York Times.
