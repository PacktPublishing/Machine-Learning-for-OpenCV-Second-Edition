TUTS presents 

"Cirque du Soleil"
Dralion

For the first time ever, performances of this awe-inspiring entertainment event, which is the toast of major cities in Europe and North America, will be offered as part of a theatre series. Only the second time Cirque du Soleil has appeared in Houston, this will be an all-new show. It's called "Dralion," and it features 54 artists from eight different countries, who present a variety of music, theatre and dance -all in a breath-taking futuristic set, in brilliantly colored costumes, with a musical score that is an inspired fusion of sounds from East and West. Cirque du Soleil is a once-in-a-lifetime theatrical opportunity that must be seen to be believed and enjoyed!
