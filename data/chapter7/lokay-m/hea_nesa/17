Michelle Lokay,

Good morning!  Before bid weeks gets cranked up next week, I wanted to remind 
you to register for the upcoming Sports Tournament.  It's only a few weeks 
away, and as additional incentive to do so, Chairman Bobby Norris has decided 
to hold a special drawing for members who have registered AND paid by October 
2.  A door prize worth approximately $500 will be awarded to some lucky early 
registrant, so get your form in today!  Have a good weekend and we'll look 
for you on the 16th.
