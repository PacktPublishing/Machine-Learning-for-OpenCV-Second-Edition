Dear NESA/HEA Members:

Just a quick reminder that the Sports Tournament is just a month away, so
please take the time to review the attached files and send in your
registration today!  If you haven't yet renewed for 2001, this is an
excellent time to do so and have your dues covered for 2002!  

Additionally, there are still a few selected sponsorships available -
LONGEST DRIVES, BEVERAGE CARTS and HOLE SPONSORSHIPS.  Give us a call at the
office (713/856-6525) and ask for me or Eva Pollard, or contact one of our
PRIZE COMMITTEE members - Charles Neuberger (Mirant Americas Energy), Ed
Troutman (CMS Field Services) or Jana Phillips (Calpine).  

I hope to see you all in October!  Have a great day and God bless America!
