Just a reminder that we still haven't received your renewal and dues for
2002!  Please take a moment to do so, and if you can't find your original
renewal application, use the attached form and just fax it in with your
credit card payment, or mail it with your check.

I hope to see you at our CRAWFISH BOIL on April 11th at Woodrow's on Chimney
Rock.  Also keep in mind our Brown Bag Field Trip on the M/V Sam Houston
(April 3), our Spring Mixer in New York (April 4), and the Risk Management
Technical Training classes on April 9-10.

Have a great day and a wonderful week. I look forward to hearing from you
soon and hope you won't delay in making sure you don't miss out on any
upcoming NESA notices!
