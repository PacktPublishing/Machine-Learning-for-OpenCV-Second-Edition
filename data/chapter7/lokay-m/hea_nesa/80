All NESA/HEA Members:

Attached is a copy of the revised Bylaws as drafted by the Executive
Committee's Transition Team.  The Transition Team was charged with, among
other duties,  reviewing the two sets of bylaws of NESA and HEA, and to
combine the two into one document that would best serve the association.
The Team has prepared a revised set of bylaws that is more consistent with
how the combined organization operates and is asking for your vote to
approve them.

Please email your response to revise the attached bylaws to Bill Harper,
NESA/HEA President at william.harper@nesanet.org as soon as possible.  The
results will be announced at the Annual Meeting in San Antonio on September
10.

Thank you for your cooperation and assistance.

Sincerely,

Teresa Knight
Vice President, Member Services
NESA/HEA
