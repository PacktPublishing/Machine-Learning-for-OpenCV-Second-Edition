Kim,  we have some units at Ivanhoe Station that have not operated in quite a long time.  We need to begin a process to abandon the units otherwise we are looking at a rather large expense to upgrade the station esd system.  Can you let us know how we can begin to move toward this end?
Fred Jordan or the Beaver Pipeline Team can provide more information about the specifics. 
Thanks for your help.
