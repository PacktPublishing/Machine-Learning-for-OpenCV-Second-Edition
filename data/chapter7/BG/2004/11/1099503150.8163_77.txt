Kindest Attention. 

This proposal may be of a surprise to you,  as we have not met in any way before. I  feel you will serve as a reliable source  to be used to achieve this aim, by  trusting under your care the total sum of  Thirty Million United States Dollars (US$ 30,000,000.00).

My name is Michael Hahn a National of  Republic of de Philippines, Manager at  Bank and the personal Accountant to late  Robert Rice a British Citizen who used to  be a private contractor with the Sibneft  Oil Trade (Siboil) Russia. 

On the 21st of April 2001 he was involved  in an auto crash alongside his wife and  their three children all occupants of the  vehicle unfortunately lost their lives,  since then I have made several enquiries  with his country's embassies to locate any  of my clients extended relatives this has  also proved unsuccessful.

After these several unsuccessful attempts  I decided to contact you with this  business partnership proposal, I have  contacted you to assist in repatriating  the funds left behind by my client before  they get confiscated or declared  unserviceable where these deposit was  lodged.

The Company has issued me a notice to  provide his next of kin otherwise have the  account confiscated within next week,  since I have been unsuccessful in locating  the relatives for over two years now. 

I seek your consent to present you as the  next of kin to the deceased so that the  money can be paid to you, this will be  disbursed in these percentages 70% to me  and 25% to you while 5% would be earmarked  for any expenses incurred during the  collection of this funds from the Holding  firm.

All I require is your honest co-operation;  confidentiality and trust to enable us see  this transaction through. I guarantee you  that this will be executed under a  legitimate arrangement that will protect  you from any breach of the law. 

If you are interested in assisting do  contact me with the following information your  address and direct telephone numbers, your  urgent response is highly anticipated and  will be appreciated.

Michael Hahn.
