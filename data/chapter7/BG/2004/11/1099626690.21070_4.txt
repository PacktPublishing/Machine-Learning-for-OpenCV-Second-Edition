GET BACK TO ME. 
 
 
FROM:MR. CHEUNG PUI 
Hang Seng Bank Ltd 
Sai Wan Ho Branch 
171 Shaukiwan Road 
Hong Kong. 
cheung_4@fastermail.com


Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. Cheung Pui 
director of operations of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd,Sai Wan Ho Branch. 
I have a obscured business suggestion for you. 
 

Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client Major Fadi Basem 
who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a 
numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value 
of Twenty Four millions Five Hundred Thousand United State 
Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several 
notice was sent to him, even during the war early this 
year. Again after the war another notification was sent 
and still no response came from him. We later find out that 
the Major and his family had been killed during the war in 
bomb blast that hit their home. 

After further investigation it was also discovered that 
Major Fadi Basem did not declare any next of kin in his 
official papers including the paper work of his bank 
deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at 
my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my 
bank. So, Twenty Four millions Five Hundred Thousand United 
State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will 
ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that 
according to the to the laws of my country at the 
expiration 3 years the funds will revert to the ownership 
of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the 
funds. 
Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will 
like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to 
Major Fadi Basem so that you will be able to receive his 
funds. 
 
WHAT IS TO BE DONE: 
 
I want you to know that I have had everything planned out 
so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an 
attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will 
back you up as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem , all 
that is required from you at this stage is for you to 
provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the 
attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the 
next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on 
your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of 
probate in your favor for the move of the funds to 



account that will be provided by you. 
 
There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are 
going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will 
 
prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to 
observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this 
issue. Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank 
account we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me, 30% for 
you . Should you be interested please send me your full 
names and current residential address and I will prefers 
you to reach me on the email address below 
cheung_4@fastermail.com) and finally after that i shall provide 
you with more details of this operation. 
 
Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated. 
 
Kind Regards 
 
Mr. Cheung Pui
