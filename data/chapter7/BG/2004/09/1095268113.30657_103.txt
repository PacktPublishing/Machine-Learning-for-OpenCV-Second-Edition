PLEASE GIVE ME AN IMMEDIATE RESPONSE

 This is to seek your co-operation as my foreign partner
and your assistance to enable me own a property and
invest in the stable economy of your country. Accept
my apologies if this mail does not suit your personal
or business ethics.

 My name is Mr. Donald Udoh. I am making this venture
proposal to you in strict confidence. The money we
want to invest was acquired from an over invoiced
contract proceed. This is in my capacity as the
chairperson of the senate financial committee 
on foreign contracts verification and payments
(Member, Contract Review Panel (CRP). Our good
fortune is that we are privy to such classified
information.

 The amount in question is $28,200,000.00 Million US
Dollars. As a senior civil servant in the Nigerian
Government, our country's prudential policy prohibits
me from operating a foreign account. If you would like
to assist me as a partner, please kindly indicate your
interest after which we shall both discuss on the
modalities.

 All other information to facilitate the remittance of
the funds will be revealed to you in due course. For
your assistance, you shall receive 25% of the funds to
be transferred and 5% will be set aside for all
expenses incurred by both parties.

 I would appreciate if this proposal is kept
confidential because of what I have explained above.
Note that you can reach me urgently on my e-mail,or
in my  (American internet fax number 1 775-514-1606, 
which I believe is more secured).

 Please do indicate your direct telephone and fax
number when replying to this business proposal. I will
be calling you when necessary. In the meantime, I will
appreciate if you can contact me through my alternative 
email udoh2004@latinmail.com 

 A swift acknowledgement on the receipt of this mail
will be appreciated.

Best regards,
Mr. Donald Udoh
