Dear Friend,
Hope this mail will not constitute an embarrassment to you. I came across your name while searching for a good Partner.
My Name is Mr.Abu Tanko personal assistant(P.A)to Mr.Kayode J. Naiyeju, the Accountant General ofthe
Federal (AGF), Federal Republic of Nigeria. Recently,a large sum of money was recovered by the present democratic government from the estate of the former military dictator, General Sanni Abacha who died in 1998.This money was stashed in variousaccounts abroad,especially in Luxemburg,Switzerland.
After recovering this money, it was discovered that the money had already accrued interest payments to the tune of over US$35 Million. Now, this money is not part of the money recovered.And no one knows about it, but me and a few trusted aides.
