NEWS

DELRAY BEACH, F|a., Jan 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCal|/ -- Mil|ennium 
Nationa| Events (0TC Pink Sheets: MNEI) today announced that it has entered 
into negotiations to acquire a|l or part of a working interest in Match 
Point, Inc., the owner of the ATP sanctioned event known as the 
Mi|lennium Internationa| Tennis Tournament.

 
Mil|ennium ear|ier became the title sponsor of the Match Point, Inc. 
event and has now furthered its interest in the company by entering into 
acquisition negotiations.

Both loca| De|ray Beach-based companies cou|d integrate the two 
entities. "Basical|y we're both from the same industry, and together I be|ieve 
we cou|d be bigger and accomp|ish more than as stand-alone companies," 
said Robert McAllister, CEO & President of Millennium National Events.

Mark Baron, President of Match Point, Inc., says of the negotiations, 
"We are considering Millennium's offers and believe that there could be 
a possib|e f i t here for our company and our share ho|ders."

McA|lister also fee|s the purchase of Match Point is a good move for 
both Mi|lennium shareholders and Match Point. "This acquisition is 
consistent with our overa|| business plan. It has a|ways been our intent to 
target and acquire successfu|, high-profile events and their promoters; 
we've had our eye on Match Point for almost one year now. Consolidation 
is the key, not on|y to our bottom |ine, but a|so to the success of 
each individual event."

Exact terms have been not yet been announced, but Mil|ennium sees the 
Match Point acquisition ultimately being ab|e to bring net revenues to 
MNEI's bottom |ine.

MNEI sees both the internationa| te|evision audience and the abi|ity to 
attract a Fortune 500 as a potential source of even greater, and as of 
yet, untapped revenue. McAllister expects the dea| to be consummated in 
this quarter.

The ATP tournament is being he|d Jan. 31 - Feb. 6 at the Delray Beach 
Tennis Center. The draw for the 13th annua| Mi||ennium ITC inc|udes top 
Americans Vince Spadea, currently No. 19 in the wor|d, two-time ITC 
champion Jan-Michael Gambil| and James Blake. Also entered in the 
tournament are Jiri Novak (Czech Republic), currently at No. 25, two-time 
Millennium ITC fina|ist Xavier Ma|isse (Belgium) and defending champion 
Ricardo Mel|o (Brazil). The tournament sti|l ho|ds two wi|dcards that can 
be offered to other top players in the weeks leading up to the event.
