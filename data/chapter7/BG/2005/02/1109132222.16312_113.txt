Dear Partner, 
 
Compliment of the season.
 
It is my pleasure to contact you to help me out of this terrible and ugly situation, l know that the content of this letter might be a suprise to you, but even though we hardly know each other I believe that you can help me.
 
I am Mrs. Mariam A. Abacha, the wife to the late Head of State, of the Federal Republic of Nigeria from 1993 -1998 - General Sani Abacha. My late husband made a lot of money as the Head of state of Nigeria for 5 years. He has different accounts in many banks of the world. He has not left any stone unturned in accruing riches for his family. 
 
The present democratic government of Nigeria led by President (Gen. (Rtd)) Olusegun Obasanjo has not found favour with my family since their inception. This may be as a result of his hatred for my late husband who kept him in jail for over two years for a coup attempt, before the death of my father. He was released immediately my husband died and he was later made the present president. He has confiscated and frozen all my family account in Nigeria and some other American, Europe and Asian continents, It has been in both the local and international news.
 
Presently, my son mohammed Abacha has been languishing in different prison custody in Nigeria for a case  against his father which he knows nothing about, but l thank the Almighty Allah for his release. Now, my purpose of all these introduction and proposal is just seeking for your candid assistance in saving this sum 0f $38,000,000.00 (THIRTY EIGHT MILLION.DOLLARS ONLY) which my late husband had hidden from the Nigerian government during his regime, and which is presently somewhere in a financial and security company outside the entire Nigeria and West African region. 
 
This is a huge sum of money, I cannot trust much on most saboteur friends of my family in Nigeria who could not be trusted. I got your contact through our trade mission . I deemed it necessary to contact you for this trustworthy transaction. All what I needed is a sincere, honest, trustworthy and God-fearing individuals whom my mind will absolve to help me in this deal. If you have feelings about my situation, don't hesitate to stand for me. If my proposal is sudden to you, all I need now is for you to stand as the beneficiary of this money to claim it and save for me. 
 
There is no difficulty, I will send your name as the recipient as well as the beneficiary of the money.On your identification and confirmation from me, the fund will be handed to you. All l need is your confirmention of willingness and l will give you the full details. You will be compensated with 25% of the total fund for all your efforts in this transaction, provided this fund is safe for me in your account in your country. 
 
Please this is a very serious matter, it is a save my soul request to you and I will be delighted too much to receive a positive response from you in order to move into action. I will give you details on request from you. 
 
Finally, if you are not interested on this matter, kindly destroy this proposal and maintain the adequate secret for the security of my fund in the security vault.
