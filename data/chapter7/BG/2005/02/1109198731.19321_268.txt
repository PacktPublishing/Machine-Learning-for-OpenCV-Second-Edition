DEPARTMENT OF MINERALS AND ENERGY
PRETORIA,
SOUTH AFRICA.

Kindly reply: fr_zamaye@yuku.org

Dear Friend,
It is my great pleasure to write you this letter on  behalf of my colleagues.I have decided to seek a  confidential co-operation   with you  in the execution of a deal hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope  you will keep it confidential because of the nature  of the business.

Within the  Department of Minerals and Energy where I work as an Assistant Director of audit,with the co-operation of two other top officials,we have in our possession an overdue contractor payment in   US  Dollars funds.The said funds  represent certain percentage of the 
contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign   contracting firm,(Pearls Ltd) which we the officials over-invoiced to the amount of US$15,200,000  (Fifteen Million Two Hundred Thousand US Dollars).Since the present elected Government is determined to pay foreign contractors all debts   owed,so as to maintain good relations with foreign governments and non-governmental agencies,we included our bills for approvals with the  Department of Finance and the Reserve Bank of South Africa (RBSA).We   are 100% sure of funds approvals to anyone or company we (The Audit   Committee) recommend as part of the sub-contractors who did jobs for the Department. 

We are seeking your assistance to front as the sub-contractor of the unclaimed funds,since we are  not allowed to operate foreign   accounts.Details and  change of beneficiary information upon   application for claim to reflect payment and approvals will be secured  on behalf of you/your Company.

My colleagues and I are prepared to give you US$2.5m while we take US$7.4m and the balance of US$5.3m for taxes and   miscellaneous expenses incurred.

This business is completely safe and secure,provided you treat it with utmost confidentiality.It does not matter whether you/your Company does contract projects,as a transfer of rights will be secured in favour of you/your Company through the Federal High Court of South Africa before we can proceed.

I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not  disappoint us.Kindly notify me immediately via my alternative email (fr_zamaye@yuku.org) for further details upon your acceptance of this proposal.
 
Yours Faithfully,
Frank Zamaye(Mr)
