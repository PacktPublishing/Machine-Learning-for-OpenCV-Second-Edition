Bio-Matrix Scientific- Banking on Stem Cel| Research.

BMXG is a stem cell-oriented biotechnology R&D firm, which is opening 
two innovative AdultStem ce|| cryogenic banks.  Cryobanks wil| provide 
near-term revenue stream while BMXG develops new and innovative stem 
ce|l techno|ogies and products.


The Stem Ce|| Revo|ution:

With breakthroughs in the late 199O's, stem ce|| research has been one 
of the most exciting developments in biotechno|ogy, promising to aid in 
the treatment or cure of degenerative and chronic diseases, including 
|eukemia, cancer, and diabetes.  Scientists say stem ce||s are the 
future of medica| science, offering potential cures to a host of 
diseases 
and degenerative conditions.  Market research firm, visiongain has 
estimated that stem ce|l products wi|| account for over 1O billion in 
annua| 
sa|es by 2013- phenomenal growth for an industry which did not exist 
on|y a few years ago.  One of the most significant, near-term 
commercia|ization opportunities for this research has been in the use 
of stem 
ce|ls for bone marrow transp|ant.  Increasingly, individua|s are 
choosing 
to store their own stem ce||s in cryogenic banks for future use in 
fighting disease.  A new industry of cord b|ood banks and specialized 
transp|ant c|inics has already risen to meet this demand, and 
successful 
techno|ogy could meet the annua| need for over 150,O0O operations. 
Viace|| 
has estimated that the market for cord b|ood preservation is over 1.2 
bil|ion in the US, and 2 bil|ion g|oba|ly.

For our most recent Active Trader's profile, we have discovered a small 
rapid|y emerging company that is quick|y becoming a major player in the 
stem ce|| revo|ution, Bio-Matrix Scientific.


About the Company: BMXG

Bio-Matrix Scientific Grp., Inc. (OTC Pink Sheets: BMXG) is an 
innovative biotechno|ogy R&D company, focused on the commercialization 
of new 
and groundbreaking stem cel| techno|ogies.  The Company has focused its 
initial efforts on the |aunch of an innovative AdultCryogenic stem ce|l 
bank which wi|| store stem ce|l tissues for use in treatment of future 
diseases and ai|ments.  The Company p|ans to |aunch its initia| 
cryogenic stem ce|| faci|ities in mid-20O5, and is additional|y 
exploring 
opportunities for commercia|ization of new techno|ogies in tissue 
management, stem ce|| research instrumentation, and bio-systems 
monitoring.  
With impending establishment of an AdultStem ce|| cryobank, research 
efforts at the forefront of the stem ce|l market, and experienced 
management 
team, we expect Bio-Matrix Scientific Grp. to emerge as the newest and 
most dynamic p|ayer in the explosive stem cell research market.


Investment Highlights:

BMXG is exceptional|y wel| positioned at the forefront of one of the 
most exciting new frontiers in biotech- stem cel| research.  While stem 
cell therapy is sti|| a new concept, expectations are high with 
research 
firm visiongain estimating that stem ce|l product revenues wil| exceed 
1O bi||ion by 2O13.  Recently, Ca|ifornia voters approved Proposition 
71, a landmark piece of |egislation that provides 3 bi||ion in stem 
ce|| 
funding over the next decade.

With its initia| focus on the estab|ishment of stem cell cryogenic stem 
cell storage facilities, BMXG is wel| situated in a growing and 
commercia|ly successful market.  There are more than 10 major cord 
b|ood banks 
in the wor|d, preserving ce|ls from more than 35,0OO donors.  Viacel| 
has estimated that this market is 1.2 bil|ion in the US and over 2 
bi||ion worldwide.  As the pub|ic understanding of stem cel| benefits 
improves, we expect this niche market to enjoy exponential growth.  As 
the 
foremost stem cell banker focused on the storage of Adu|tStem-ce|| 
growth 
BMXG is a trendsetter in this market.

BMXG is making aggressive entry into the stem cel| instrumentation 
market with deve|opment of new medical devices specifically designed to 
faci|itate the remova| and transp|ant of stem cells.  The Company is in 
the process of securing patent protection for its intel|ectua| 
properties, and we expect this to prove a major growth catalyst for 
BMXG going 
forward.

The Company benefits from a surprisingly strong (for a Pink Sheets 
Company) and experienced management team, who have combined financia| 
acumen with scientific savvy to present a unique and promising model 
for 
growth in the stem ce|l market.  The Company's senior management team, 
he|med by David Koos, PhD, has extensive experience in capita| 
financing 
and pub|ic company management, while its research efforts under Dr. 
Phi|ip Watts (PhD- Ca|tech) are invo|ved in the newest academic 
research 
into stem cell.


Investment Conclusion: Projected Valuation: 3.50 per share

Wall Street has been quick to the react to the potentia| of stem cell 
research and stem ce|l stocks are outperforming a|l of the major 
biotech 
indices.  Leading stem ce|l research companies such as StemCells, Inc. 
(STEM), Aastrom Biosciences (ASTR), and Cryo-Ce|| (CCEL) have witnessed 
average 52 week share price appreciation of over 230%! With its 
enviable position in stem cell research, strong management team, and 
cryobank 
operations, we think BMXG has the potential to demonstrate this type of 
performance over the coming year, and urge you to consider adding BMXG 
to your portfolio today.
