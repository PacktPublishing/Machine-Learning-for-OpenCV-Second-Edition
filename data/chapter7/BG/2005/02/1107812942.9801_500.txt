Beloved in Christ.

It is by the grace of God that I received Christ, knowing the truth and the truth have this day set me free. Having known the truth, I had no choice than to do what is lawful and right in the sight of God for eternal life and in the sight of man for witness of God’s mercy and glory upon my life.

I have the pleasure to share my testimony with you, having seen your contact from the Internet. I am Mr. Frank Kingsley, personal assistant to late Mr. and Mrs. Williams, a British couple that lived in my Country Nigeria for 25 years before they both died in a car accident late last year. 

These couples were good Christians, they were so dedicated to God but they had no child till they died. Throughout their stay in my country, they acquired a lot of properties like lands, house properties, etc.
As their assistance before their death, the husband Mr. Williams instructed his British lawyer to write his WILL. Because they had no child, they dedicated their wealth to God. According to the WILL, the properties have to be sold and the money be given out to a ministry in Europe, Asia and America for the work of God. 
As their personal assistant, copies of some of the documents for the properties were in my care while original copies where in the custody of the attorney.

He gave me the authority to sell the properties while the lawyer gives out the fund to the Ministries for the work of God.
To cut the story short, we sold all the properties after their death, as instructed by my boss, Mr. Williams before his death.
And as matter of fact, after we sold all their properties, expectedly realized a huge amount of money that runs into millions of dollars, and what supposed to be his percentage interest of his right legal fee was firstly deducted by me out of the total amount realized from the sold properties, this was based on the initial agreement between him and the Owner of the properties before his death. 
Therefore, the total amount left to be invested into God's work as instructed by the owner is $12,500,000.00 (twelve million, five hundred thousand US dollars) only. But Instead of giving the main fund out for the work of God as instructed to us by my boss before his death.

I converted the fund to myself with the intention of investing the fund abroad for our personal use. I was afraid of putting the fund in our local Bank here due to the recent probe on bank accounts, because I have to give account to the bank on how I got the money. 
I had encounter with Christ when Pastor Benny Hinn was preaching on television concerning Ananias and Saphira in Acts 5:1-11. 
After hearing the word of God, I gave my life to Christ and became a born again Christian.
As a born again Christian, I started reading my bible and one day, the Lord opened my eyes to Ezekiel 33: 18 and 19. From the scripture, I discovered that the only way I could have peace in my life is to do what is lawful and right by giving out the fund as instructed for the work of God by my Boss.
I have asked God for forgiveness on my initial thought concerning the money, and I know that God have forgiven me. But I have to do what is lawful and right in the sight of God by giving out the fund to the chosen ministry abroad for the purpose of God's work as instructed by my boss before his death.
After my fasting and prayers, I asked God to make his choice and direct me to an honest Christian that deserves this fund by his Grace.

I then came across your address on the Internet as I was browsing through a Christian site, and as a matter of fact, it is not only you or your ministry that I picked on the Christian site initially, but after my fervent prayer over it, then you were nominated through divine revelation from God, so that was how I received a divine revelation from the Lord, how I Got your contact information, and I then decided to contact you for the fund to be used wisely for things that will glorify the name of God.
I have notified the attorney on my contact to you, I also told him that the security company here have moved the fund abroad to their warehouse London, So if you know that you will use this fund honestly and wisely for things that will glorify God's name, then do contact me back, ASAP.
Then you send to me in your reply, YOUR FULL NAMES, YOUR PERSONAL ADDRESS, YOUR TELEPHONE NUMBERS. 
This Information’s will I send to their office here to enable them forward the same to their warehouse officer in London to facilitate the process of the consignment receiver's documentation in your name.

Your prompt response will be highly appreciated. Call me immediately you receive this email.
God bless you.
Yours in Christ.
Mr. Frank Kingsley
