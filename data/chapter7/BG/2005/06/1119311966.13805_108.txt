Dear Sir/Madam,

decided to contact you.

account of the federal pay office to your account as soon as possible.

 

Source of the funds are:  

 

During the Arap Moi's government, government=92s officials awarded contracts =
to their own companies, these contracts were grossly over invoiced. Now the =
present government set up contract review panel to settle those owed =
outstanding amount. My colleagues and I have identified a huge amount =
totaling US$ 370m (Three hundred and seventy million us dollars) oversea .

 

We would want US$43.8m (Forty three million Eight Hundred Thousand) dollars =
out this money oversea transferred to your account because we are not =
eligible to operate foreign account, and I have been mandated to search for a =
partner abroad. We really want this transfer made as soon as possible before =
the government, who have started refunding money from Moi's foreign accounts =
track this money. We will be offering 20% for your assistance.

 

If you would want to proceed with this transaction please reply with your =
name and phone number to (abdallakenya300@netscape.net) and if you do not =
