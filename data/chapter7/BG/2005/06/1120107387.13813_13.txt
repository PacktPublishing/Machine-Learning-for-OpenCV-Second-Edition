is 
on North America, the opportunity for security services is worldwide.

worldwide demand for information security products and services is set 
to 
eclipse $46B by 2O05.

Vinoble intends to capitalize on the dramatic growth in the security 
market 
by delivering professional services, security products, security 
training, 
and managed security services. In pursuit of this objective, Vinoble

assembled a highly qualified team of security professionals offering a 
full 
range of security services. Through Vinoble's consulting services and 
integrated delivery solutions, Vinoble will help organizations protect 
key 
assets including persons, property, information, brand, and reputation.
