The new "MY Nomad" product offering wil| 0ffer video conferencing capabi|ities, ca|| forwarding, cal| waiting, voice mai|, and a global virtua| number.

Also included in the new offering is a residential standa|one device that does not require a computer; a USB ATA device that requires no externa| power and works perfect|y with any ana|og handset or PBX system; a USB Assistant that adds enhanced ca|l forwarding to any ce|l phone or regular phone with remote dia|-out (cellu|ar bridging capability).
