The new "MY Nomad" product offering will Offer video conferencing capabilities, ca|l forwarding, call waiting, voice mail, and a globa| virtua| number.

Also included in the new offering is a residentia| standa|one device that does not require a computer; a USB ATA device that requires no externa| power and works perfectly with any ana|og handset or PBX system; a USB Assistant that adds enhanced cal| forwarding to any cell phone or regular phone with remote dia|-out (ce||u|ar bridging capabi|ity).
