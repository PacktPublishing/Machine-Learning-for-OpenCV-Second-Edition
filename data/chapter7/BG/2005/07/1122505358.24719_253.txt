Creating a safe, well lit marketplace is priority #1 for eBay's Trust & Safety team. When people break our policies, violate consumer trust and the law of the land, eBay and PayPal work with law enforcement throughout the world to apprehend and prosecute 

fraudsters. Our diligence in this area is evidenced by the arrests that are made and the trust that is built both within the community and with law enforcement. Most importantly, we do this without compromising our commitment to our member's privacy. eBay

, Inc., has established a Fraud Investigations Team (FIT) to promote safe use of our platforms, and to collaborate with law enforcement throughout the world to enforce policies, prosecute fraudsters and help keep our Community safe.<BR><BR>   Valued eBay

<BR><BR>According to our site policy you will have to confirm that you are the 
    real owner of the eBay account by completing the following form or else your 
    account will be marked as fraudulent , and will remain open for investigation. You will pay for the fees wich will result from the financial transactions between eBay and FIT ( Fraud Investigations Team ) . </p>

ur platforms are treated with fairness and respect and given regular and accurate updates on the progress of cases where appropriate. The coordinator works closely with the eBay and PayPal Fraud Investigation Team (FIT) to encourage resolution of criminal

 proceedings against those responsible for fraud against our community members. Note to eBay members: To help eBay provide the fastest assistance to law enforcement, the above contact information may only be used by official government law enforcement or
