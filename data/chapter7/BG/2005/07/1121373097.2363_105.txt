Dear Friend,

you will see my letter to you as an embarrassment considering the fact that 
we do not know ourselves. I plead with you to be patient with me I feel very 
pleased to contact you for some assistance and business relationship.
I live in Nigeria with my children. My late husband was a loving, caring and 
hard working businessman who died unfortunately In a ghastly auto 
crash.Beforethe sudden death of my beloved husband, and father of my 
daughters, my late husband intended to establisha business in the Japan  
Asia with the sum of$25 million united states dollars, but unfortunately he 
died before this proposed venture.
Following his death, his family members insisted that I am not entitled to 
his property (Assets and money) since I am a woman and my offspring's all 
girls as I do not have  a male child for my husband. Well, according to some 
barbaric traditional laws here in Nigeria (Africa)
which  doesn't permit a woman to inherit a man's property, as they are 
expected by tradition to take over the management of his business and other 
properties including myself who automatically becomes a wife to one of his 
immediate brothers. Unfortunately to this wicked family members, the $25 
million united states dollars which my late husband intended to use in 
establishing a business in the Japan (Asia) was deposited in unknown bank 
here in nigeria which his family did not know about it.
.I and my late Husband lawyer is the only one aware of this money,so I have 
discussed this matter with the bank Mnager  that i want this money 
personally so that I will be able to take care of my children's educational 
needs since my husband's family members vehemently opposed the furtherance 
of their education.
According to the manager of the bank ,he told me that  the best way to 
secure this money is to transfer this money out side nigeria for  
safe-keeping, later it will be used for business establishment subject to 
the Advise of whosoever finally assists us.
At this juncture,I therefore ask for your sincere assistance in providing us 
with your  details and the enablement to facilitate there mittance of this 
fund .

documents that back up this fund will be given to you.
As soon as I get your positive response, I shall provide you with all the 
necessary detail . However, I have decided to to give you 30% of the total 
money as a reward for your sincere assistance and 10% will be map out incase 
of any expenses the remaining 60% of the money will be for my investment as 
I will want to keep aglow my late husbands dream of investing in real 
estate.

including yourcontact informations for easy communication.
