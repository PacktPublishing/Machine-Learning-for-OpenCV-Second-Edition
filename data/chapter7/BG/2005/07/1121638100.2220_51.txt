<font face=Arial><B>Jokes of the day</B><br>

<FONT  COLOR=cccccc>Never say it at work</FONT><BR>
Twelve things you'll never hear an employee tell his/her boss<BR>
<ol>
<li>Never give me work in the morning. Always wait until 5:00 and then bring it to me. The challenge of a deadline is always refreshing. 
<li>If it's really a "rush job," run in and interrupt me every 10 minutes to inquire how it's going. That greatly aids my efficiency. 
<li>Always leave without telling anyone where you're going. It gives me a chance to be creative when someone asks where you are. 
<li>If my arms are full of papers, boxes, books or supplies, don't open the door for me. I might need to learn how to function as a paraplegic in future and opening doors is good training. 
<li>If you give me more than one job to do, don't tell me which is the priority. Let me guess. 
<li>Do your best to keep me late. I like the office and really have nowhere to go or anything to do.
<li>If a job I do pleases you, keep it a secret. Leaks like that could get me a promotion. 
<li>If you don't like my work, tell everyone. I like my name to be popular in conversations. 
<li>If you have special instructions for a job, don't write them down. If fact, save them until the job is almost done. 
<li>Never introduce me to the people you're with. When you refer to them later, my shrewd deductions will identify them. 
<li>Be nice to me only when the job I'm doing for you could really change your life. 
<li>Tell me all your little problems. No one else has any and it's nice to know someone is less fortunate. 
</ol>
<FONT  COLOR=cccccc>Pick a starting salary</FONT><BR>
Reaching the end of a job interview, the Human Resources Person asked the young MBA fresh out of MIT, And what starting salary were you looking for? <BR>
The candidate said, In the neighborhood of $125,000 a year, depending on the benefits package. <BR>
The HR Person said, Well, what would you say to a package of 5 weeks vacation, 14 paid holidays, full medical and dental, company matching retirement fund to 50% of salary, and a company car leased every 2 years - say, a red Corvette?<BR> 
The Engineer sat up straight and said, Wow! Are you kidding?<BR>
And the HR Person said, Certainly, ... but you started it.<BR>
