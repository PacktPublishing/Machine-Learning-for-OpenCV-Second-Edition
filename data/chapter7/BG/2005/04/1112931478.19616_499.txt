Dear ,

I am Mrs. Suha Arafat, the wife of Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader who =
died recently in Paris. Since his death and even prior to the announcement, I =
have been thrown into a state of antagonism, confusion, humiliation, =
frustration and hopelessness by the present leadership of the Palestinian =
Liberation Organization and the new Prime Minister. I have even been =
subjected to physical and psychological torture. As a widow that is so =
traumatized, I have lost confidence with everybody in the country at the =
moment.

You must have heard over the media reports and the Internet on the discovery =
of some fund in my husband secret bank account and companies and the =
allegations of some huge sums of money deposited by my husband in my name of =
which I have refuses to disclose or give up to the corrupt Palestine =
Government.

In fact the total sum allegedly discovered by the Government so far is in the =
tune of about $6.5 Billion Dollars. And they are not relenting on their =
effort to make me poor for life. 
I have deposited the sum of 21 million dollars with a Security financial firm =
in whose name is withheld for now until we open communication. I shall be =
grateful if you could receive this fund into your bank account for safe =
keeping and Investment opportunity. This arrangement will be known to you and =
I alone and all our correspondence should be strictly on email alone because =
our government has tapped all my lines and are monitoring all my moves.

In view of the above, if you are willing to assist for our mutual benefits, =
we will have to negotiate on your Percentage share of the $21,000,000 that =
will be kept in your position for a while pending when my daughter, Zahwa, =
will come off age and take full responsibility of her Family =
Estate/inheritance. 
Please, if you are honest, I am going to entrust more funds in your care as =
this is one of the legacy we keep for our children. In case you don't accept =
please do not let me out to the security and international media as I am =
giving you this information in total trust and confidence I will greatly =
appreciate if you accept my proposal in good faith and send to me your =
complete personal contact information.

May God bless you and your household.

Yours sincerely,
Madam Suha .           Reply to:  shh_43@yahoo.it
