Mobile production units for developing countries - Worldwide Partners program

SN World Foundation will supply to countries and developing regions the technology and necessary support for production in series of Mini-plants in mobile=20containers (40-foot). The Mini-plant system is designed in such a way that all the production machinery is fixed on the platform of the container, with all wiring,=20piping, and installation parts; that is, they are fully equipped... and the Mini-plant is ready for production.

More than 700 portable production systems: Bakeries, Water purification, Dehydrated food, Steel Nails, Fruit juice preparation, Tire Retreading, Reinforcement=20Bar Bending for Construction Framework, Sheeting for Roofing, Ceilings and Fa=E7ades, Plated Drums, Aluminum Buckets, Injected Polypropylene Housewares,=20Pressed Melamine Items (Glasses, Cups, Plates, Mugs, etc.), Mufflers, Construction Electrically Welded Mesh, Plastic Bags and Packaging, Medical assistance=20mobile units, Sanitary Material, Hypodermic Syringes, Hemostatic Clamps, etc.=20
The Mini-plants of production in mobile containers is the ONLY system in the world that can provide up to six (6) of the most essential products for basic=20sustenance for just one dollar (=241.00) per day. The following examples being proof of this: The price per 1,000 liters of drinking water produced by the Mini-
plant is =240.09 (nine cent), 1,200% cheaper than the average price for water in developed countries, and up to 7,120% cheaper than that available in developed=20countries. The price per kilogram of bread water produced by the Mini-plant is =240.10 (ten cent). Only one kilogram of bread provides more than 2,500 calories,=20as well as carbohydrates, proteins, iron and calcium.

SN World Foundation has started a Co-investment program for the installation of small Assembly Plants to manufacture, in series, the Mini-plants of portable=20production on site, region or country where required. One of the most relevant features is the fact that these plants will be connected to the International Trade=20System, with access to more than 50 million raw materials, products and services and automatic transactions for world trade.

Due to financial reasons, involving cost and social impact, the best solution is setting up Assembly Plants on the same countries and regions, using local resources=20(labor, some equipment, etc.) SN World Foundation participates at 50% (fifty percent) for investment of each Assembly Plant.

If you are interested in being a partner in your country or region, you can send your CV to: SN World Foundation (click here) <A HREF=3D=22mailto:tech=40world-

HUNGER IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD
One child dies every five seconds from hunger and related causes,=20More than 27,000 every day,=2010 million every year...
