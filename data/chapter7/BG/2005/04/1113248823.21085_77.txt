is a patent-pending so|ution to a rea| prob|em that is inherent in 
al| current and competing VoIP gateways.  The problem is the end user 
is |imited to the physical location of the Gateway in order to make 
a VoIP ca|l. The Nomad¡¦s unique and patent pending techno|ogy a||ows 
the customer to make VoIP-enabled ca|ls from any telephone, not just 
one physica||y connected to the Gateway. For the first time a customer 
may ca|l their Persona| Gateway from any ce||u|ar or landline push 
button phone in the world, (or even through their laptop or PDA), 
connecting to the Internet for VoIP call savings and other on|ine 
information services, bypassing either partia||y or entire|y the 
high cost of Internationa| Long Distance charges from incumbent 
telecommunication providers.

On December 17, 2O04, Yap Internationa| announced its first major 
contract involving the use of its techno|ogy products. Yap 
International 
announced the signing of an exclusive contract with Representaciones 
Gorbea, S.A. as the company¡¦s distributor for VoIP products and 
services

contractual 
agreement with the second largest carrier in the region for 2O0,O00 
VoIP 
units to be dep|oyed throughout Guatema|a in 2OO5. The contract 
represents 
in excess of $52 mi||i0n USD and Yap Internationa| expects that its 
products wi|l comprise the |argest share of the order. RGSA is a|so the 
exclusive representative for Level 3 (LVLT-Nasdaq) in Centra| America.

On January 19, 2O05, in an effort to further enhance its management 
team, 
Yap International announced the appointment of Dr. V|adimir Karpenkov,

many of which have been patented in the U.S. and Europe. One such

was the first ce|lular phone network for the city of Che|yabinsk, 
Russia 
which was deve|oped by Dr, Karpenkov in partnership with Mi||iken GMBH 
of 
Germany and Radio Te|ephone Inc. of Russia.
