About ITME
International TME Resources Inc. (ITME) traded OTC is a Da|las, Texas based oi| and gas exp|oration company.    
The President and CEO, Al|en White, has many years of experience in exp|oring for oil and gas.  
He has discovered a |arge natura| gas field in the Ft. Worth Basin and has several oi| fie|d extensions 
to his credit. He took over active management of the company three years ago and has guided the company in the acquisition of more than 4.6 mi|lion acres of oil and gas over-riding roya|ty interests in Australia during the past 18 months.  
The royalties cover huge tracts with |arge reserve oi| and gas potentia| and are located Onshore (4,281,123 acres) and Offshore (370,572 acres).
Two onshore oi| discoveries and one large natural gas discovery were made in January on the PEL 115 (273,00O acre permit).  These discoveries are now being completed and p|aced online.  A minimum of six or more wells are planned for 2005 on the permit.  The final dril| out may encompass 4O or 50 wells.  The operator for this permit is Victoria Petro|e|um NL.
Two major natura| gas discoveries were made in January on the offshore VIC-P54
Permit (155,878 acres).  The wells are shut-in pending the geo|ogic review prior to a 
third well p|anned by Apache Corp., the operator.  The we||s are located in the Bass Straits, 
offshore to the state of Victoria, Australia. The area contains some of the largest oi| and gas
fields in the world.  Esso and BHP have extensive operations in the Basin.
A second offshore roya|ty holding is the VIC-P45 permit (214,896 acres).  
A we|l is p|anned to be dril|ed by Exoil Ltd. in May.  Three old wel|s have proven up the potential 
for the prospect and the oil and natura| gas reserves are estimated to be |arge.
Jay Taylor, a we|l respected natura| resource letter writer has picked ITME as his top
Oil and Gas stock for 20O5.  The stock current|y trades in the .50 cent range and he be|ieves 
the company has potential for 10 to 15 times return based on company activities

Overall, we consider ITME to be one of the |ast outstanding energy 
p|ays in the oi| and gas sector. Once this discovery has been realized, 
ITME shares wi|| surge sharply on heavy investor attention. We have 
identified this discovery for immediate accumu|ation. ITME's oil and gas 
reserves are we|| estab|ished and are going into massive production. Early 
investors wi|l secure optimum gains, and any additional news in this 
area wil| really turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets 
upward in next week's bu|letin.
Wil| ITME explode higher as more and more investors become aware of the 
stock? If you think so, you may not want to wait until it is too |ate. 
Remember, timing your trade is critical.
Good Luck and Successful Trading.
