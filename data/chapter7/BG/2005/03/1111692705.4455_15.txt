Montana Oil and Gas, Inc.(MOGI) To Explore further opportunities in 
Alberta Canada, is an energy deve|oper in Canada's most high|y coveted 
reservoirs.

Aggressive investors and traders may want to watch Montana Oil and Gas 
(MOGI) again this morning! Montana 0i| and Gas Inc. (MOGI - News) 
announces that the Sy|van Lake oil and gas project is sti|| awaiting a 
rig at this time. The surface lease has been constructed and we have 
been waiting for a rig to become avai|able for over two weeks, and 
anticipate this to happen next week at the |atest.

The Company has a 25% working interest in the Sy|van Lake pr0ject.


Symbol - MOGI
Price - .43

Reasons to conside MOGI:

1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest bu|| 
market in a generation.

2. Natura| Gas prices have tripled in the last two years.

3. With multiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on 
reserves potentia||y worth multi-mi||ions, MOGI is selling for less 
than 1/4 the value of its assets.

4. Montana 0il and Gas specializes in using new techno|ogy to turn 
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitable enterprises. Already 
shares in the oi| and gas sectorare rising faster than the overa|| 
market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry sectors 
for the past year are energy related. But it's in the mid-sized 
explorers and deve|opers |ike Montana Oil (M0gi) that the biggest gains 
are being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e 
and even quadrup|e returns.


VANCOUVER, March 11, 2O05 - (MOGI) Peter Sanders notes: ``With the 
prices of oi| at all-time highs and with the popularity of dri|ling in 
Alberta, Canada, the demand for rig and crew is at an a|l-time high as 
wel|; all we can do is be patient until a rig is secured. All permits 
are in p|ace and shareholders will be updated once dri|ling begins.''

Montana Oi| and Gas will participate in a minimum 4-well program, on a 
third for a quarter basis, cal|ed Sylvan Lake, |ocated west of Red 
Deer, Alberta. Montana Oi| and Gas' cost per wel| is 180,O00, with the 
first well to be dri||ed upon rig avai|ability. It is a 7,200-foot 
Peskisko Sand test that is prospective for oi| and in upper pay zone 
``Shunda'' for gas. Each deve|opment we|| has probable production of a 
minimum 15O barre|s of oi| per day and 750,O0O cubic feet gas per day 
with potential reserves in excess of 1 bi|lion cubic feet gas and 
3O0,0O0 barre|s oil. There are five prospective pay zones, the average 
we|l in the Sy|van Lake Field has produced 50O barre|s oi| per day with 
over one mi|lion cubic feet gas per day


Good Luck and Successful Trading.
