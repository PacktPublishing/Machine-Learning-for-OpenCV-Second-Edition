Vince:

I had a phone call from Joe Phelan late yesterday.  He was thrilled that you 
had answered his question so thoroughly.  I've talked to a few other people 
who really got a lot out of your session, including someone who wants to come 
work for you!

Thanks, again, for giving us some of your time.
