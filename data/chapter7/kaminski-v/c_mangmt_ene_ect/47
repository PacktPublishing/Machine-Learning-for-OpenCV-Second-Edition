Good Morning!

Here is the latest draft of your article for the ENSIDE Newsletter.  I have 
forwarded it to the design team and expect them to send me a layout copy 
sometime next week.  We will be able to make any additional changes then. 

Talk to you next week - have a great weekend!

Best regards,
Kathie
