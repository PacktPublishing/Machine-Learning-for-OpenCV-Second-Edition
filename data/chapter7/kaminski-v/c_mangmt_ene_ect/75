Thank you so much for reserving an Analyst for our group.   Tomorrow is my 
last day in Houston until I return from London in 2 months.  I won't forget 
something for your baby.  I've asked Gwyn Koepke and Vince Kaminski to 
interview Mitra Mujica in my absence.  Vince likes to interview all 
candidates prior to being employed in the Research Department.  I can 
interview over the telephone.  Could you please send us Mitra's resume.

Regards,

Maureen
