Greg,

Two things I did not manage to mention to you at the meeting on Monday.

1. Joe Carson. I was very positively impressed by Joe Carson.
     Enron  badly needs a senior economist of his stature and 
     experience. He has many contacts in the industry and can represent 
     Enron well. He is very pragmatic and, also, I expect a cool head on old 
     shoulders.

     One negative is that he wants to work out of New York. The tradeoff is 
between
     maintaining  his contacts and working closer with the desks. 

2. Tony Mends. I think you, or Louise, should explore the possibility of 
using the skills of Tony Mends.
    Tony and I are good friends so I may be biased. I think that he is a very 
smart
    and efficient person and can contribute a lot to the organization that 
relies
    on processing huge volumes of information.
