Ah, these wonderful new systems!  I submitted an order on the "new" IBuyit
site and sent it for approval and it went to every manager in our group!

I called them and told them that only you were the approver and they do not
even have a user ID set up for you.  Please fill out the below security document
and I will forward it on to them.

Thanks!

Shirley

Hi Shirley

In processing your iBuyit approval change request, I discovered that Vince Kaminski has not been set up with a user ID in the eProcurement system.  Please have him fill out the attached security form and send it to -- SAP Security@enron.com

I have already selected the Approver role on the second page.  We just need the personal information on page one filled out for security purposes.  Once this is done we can get Vince assigned as the approver for cost center 107043.

Thanks,
Michael
