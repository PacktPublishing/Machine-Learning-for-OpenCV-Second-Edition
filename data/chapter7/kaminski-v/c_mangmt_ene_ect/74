NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Weather Deal
Enron has traded a weather derivative deal with the Rock Garden restaurant =
in=20
London's Covent Garden.  Based on a 'cold day' index, the deal protects the=
=20
Rock Garden from a summer that has too many days below a certain temperatur=
e=20
between March and June. Once a number of days has been reached, the Rock=20
Garden will receive a payout for each further day below that reference=20
temperature. The payouts have been weighted to reflect the greater earning=
=20
potential in some months compared to others. In a blind auction, Enron beat=
=20
six other risk takers to price the deal.
