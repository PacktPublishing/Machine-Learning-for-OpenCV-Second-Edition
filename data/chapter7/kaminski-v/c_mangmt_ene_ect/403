Vince,

We have many Associates that we have to place within business units.  
Thereafter, if there are additional hiring needs, we will consider her 
resume.  

Regards,
Shannon

Shannon,

I realize that the program is full. If I find a group interested in her,
would you consider re-inviting her?

Vince,

Thank you for forwarding the resume of Carla Di Castro.  Currently, our 
Summer Associate Internship program is full.  I have responded to Carla to 
inform her of the program's status.
