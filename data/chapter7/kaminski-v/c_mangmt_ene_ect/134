Good afternoon ladies,

I am working with Vince Kaminski, Director of Research, Enron Corp. and John 
Martin, Chair of Finance at Baylor University to schedule one hour time slots 
with Ken Lay, Jeff Skilling and Andy Fastow.  

Vince and John Martin are jointly authoring a 20-40 page paper, written in 
the style of a Harvard Business Review piece, about 'Transforming Enron 
Corporation as an Act of Managerial Will - The Value of Active Management'.  
Attached below you will find a brief outline of the proposed case study, 
although I have requested John Martin to provide us with the specific 
questions he will be asking all three participants.

We would like to schedule the one hour interviews on the following dates:

Monday, December 4th

Tuesday, December 5th

Week of December 11th


Please let me know at your earliest convenience which of the above-mentioned 
dates/times works best with everyone's calendar.  Thanks a million.
