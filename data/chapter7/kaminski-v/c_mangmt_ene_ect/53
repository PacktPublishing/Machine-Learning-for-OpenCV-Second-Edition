CEO says Texas in good shape for electricity deregulation
DALLAS (AP) - Enron Corp.'s chief executive and president said Tuesday he=
=20
believes that Texas energy markets are in good shape as the state prepares=
=20
for deregulation.=20
Jeffrey Skilling told an audience of about 400 business people at a downtow=
n=20
hotel that California "has given the term deregulation a terrible name." =

Electric deregulation in Texas officially starts Jan. 1. "In Texas, I think=

we've got a pretty good system," he said.=20
In San Francisco on Tuesday, the California Public Utilities Commission=20
unanimously approved electricity rate increases of up to 46 percent to try =
to=20
head off blackouts this summer by keeping the state's two biggest utilities=
=20
from going under.  When California officials set up deregulation they allow=
ed=20
the price of wholesale electricity to rise but capped the amount companies=
=20
could charge customers, Skilling said. SoCal Edison and Pacific Gas &=20
Electric say they have lost more than $13 billion since last summer because=
=20
they haven't been able to pass on the high cost of wholesale electricity.=

Skilling said Texans are in a much better position and shouldn't worry that=

their state's deregulation would be like the California experience. =20
"California, they just put together a crazy system,=018 he said in his firs=
t=20
public comments since becoming the Houston-based company's chief executive=

officer in February. "The markets in California are the most regulated=20
markets in North America today. And that's what is causing the problem."   =

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron Reopens Rassau Power Station Plans
Enron Europe submitted an application to build a 1200MW combined cycle gas=
=20
turbine power station on the Rassau Industrial Estate at Ebbw Vale, Wales i=
n=20
July 1998. In November 2000, the Government lifted its stricter power=20
consents policy, which placed restrictions on the development of new=20
gas-fired power stations, and Enron is now concluding the consultation=20
process for the application

As part of the process, updated environmental information has been submitte=
d=20
to the Department of Trade and Industry and a team from Enron will be=20
presenting the plans to Blaenau Gwent Council on March 26. This will be=20
followed by a three-day public exhibition in the local community.

Enron expects to receive a decision later in the year.

European Economic Summit: Acceleration Directives
On March 23 and 24 the European Economic Council Summit will take place in=
=20
Stockholm.  At=20
this summit the European Commission will present to the heads of the Member=
=20
States a legislative proposal for a Directive and a Regulation that the=20
Commission adopted on March 13 to speed up the completion of the internal=
=20
electricity and gas markets.

Enron issued a statement to the media on the evening of Wednesday 21st Marc=
h=20
stating that it specifically endorses the following initiatives incorporate=
d=20
in the text of the adopted proposal:

Legal unbundling of the transmission and distribution networks as a realist=
ic=20
solution, ensuring the independence of transmission and distribution system=
=20
operators.=20
Mandatory appointment of independent regulators in each country with the=20
obligation to fix or approve transmission tariffs before they come into for=
ce.
The current timetable proposed by the Commission: market opening for=20
electricity in 2003 and for gas in 2004 (industrial, commercial and wholesa=
le=20
customers); and for supplies to all consumers including households by 2005.=
 =20
The setting of rules in the Regulation for how power transmission tariffs c=
an=20
be charged for cross-border transactions and how congestion and capacity=20
allocation at borders within the EU should be managed by transmission syste=
m=20
operators.

Enron concludes that it is encouraged by the efforts of the Commission to=
=20
accelerate the European electricity and gas market opening and the=20
reinforcement of third party rights of access to transmission networks. The=
=20
Commission's approach of harmonizing both the timetable and the regulatory=
=20
framework deserves support from all Member States. =20
