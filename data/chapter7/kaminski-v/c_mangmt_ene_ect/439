From:  Cliff Baxter and Kevin Hannon


In July, as part of the Enron North America (ENA) reorganization, the=20
implementation of several objectives were highlighted as critical to the=20
continued growth of ENA including: 1) accelerate the development of our=20
people, 2) significantly expand our customer network and associated markets=
,=20
and 3) accelerate and enhance the information flow between groups, both=20
within ENA and across Enron. Consistent with these objectives and with the=
=20
corporate goal of fostering =01&One Enron=018, we would like to announce th=
e=20
following organizational changes in the Coverage/Origination Groups and the=
=20
Commercial Transactions Group within ENA.

1) Coverage/Origination:

To ensure a consistent strategy, the free flowing of resources and product=
=20
technology and the appropriate focus in the midstream and downstream=20
businesses, the following coverage/origination groups will be consolidated=
=20
under the leadership of Dave Delainey :
a) power development solutions for electric and gas utilities, municipals,=
=20
co-ops, energy service companies and IPP=01,s;
b) the Downstream Coverage/Origination groups which focus on delivering a=
=20
broad range of products and services to the heavy industrial customers=20
including  pulp and paper, chemicals, plastics, refined products, metals an=
d=20
mining, heavy manufacturing, industrial gases, fertilizers, transportation,=
=20
textiles and glass manufacturing the Eastern and Western U.S. Midstream=20
Coverage/ Origination groups which focus on energy, finance and industries.

Downstream Coverage/Origination

As energy deregulation continues in North America, it is becoming clear tha=
t=20
the heavy industrial segment will be an important customer market for both=
=20
ENA and Enron Corp.  Further, it is clear that ENA can significantly expand=
=20
its industrial customer network and create more innovative industrial=20
solutions by having a group that can deploy all the capabilities of Enron=
=20
Corp.  Against this backdrop, the Downstream Coverage/Origination function=
=20
will expand its product offering to include not only ENA=01,s existing ener=
gy=20
commodities, energy services, finance, assets and pulp and paper capabiliti=
es=20
but also EES=01,s energy outsourcing capability and Global Fuel=01,s chemic=
als,=20
plastics and refined products risk management capability.  These additional=
=20
capabilities will be offered in conjunction with EES and the Global Fuels=
=20
groups. Given the size and importance of this Enron initiative, Greg Piper=
=20
will be returning from Portland to manage this business. Under Greg=01,s=20
leadership, the Downstream Origination effort will be segmented into three=
=20
sub-groups given the nature of these industries and our product offering:
a) Pulp and Paper =01) Edward Ondarza will continue to manage the coverage=
=20
activities in the Pulp and Paper business. This group will be responsible f=
or=20
the provision of innovative=20
products and services in the pulp and paper industry including the provisio=
n=20
of paper risk management products;
b) Chemicals, Plastics and Refined Products =01) We have asked Jim Ajello t=
o=20
lead the coverage activities in this business.  This group will be=20
responsible for the provision of innovative products and services in the=20
chemicals and refined products industries;
c) Non-Integrated Industrials =01) Bruce Garner, formerly leader of Bankers=
=20
Trust=01,s global metals and mining group in London, has joined ENA to lead=
 the=20
coverage activities in this business.  This group will be responsible for t=
he=20
provision of innovative products and services for the metals and mining,=20
heavy manufacturing, industrial gases, fertilizers, transportation, textile=
s=20
and glass manufacturing industries.




Midstream Coverage/Origination

a) Eastern Coverage/Origination =01) This group=01, activities will focus o=
n=20
energy, finance and power development solutions for electric and gas=20
utilities, municipals, co-ops and energy service companies in the Eastern=
=20
Interconnect. We have asked  Janet Dietrich to assume the leadership of thi=
s=20
group;
b) Western Coverage/Origination =01) This group=01,s activities will focus =
on=20
energy, finance and power development solutions for electric and gas=20
utilities, municipals, co-ops and energy service companies in the WSCC. The=
y=20
will also continue to manage all Qualified Facilities (QF) restructuring=20
opportunities in the Western U.S.  We have asked Chris Calger to assume the=
=20
leadership of this coverage group. Chris will relocate to Portland from=20
Calgary where he currently leads the Canadian downstream origination effort=
s;
c) IPP Merchant Coverage/Origination =01) This group=01,s activities will f=
ocus on=20
the provision of structured energy, finance and asset solutions for the=20
emerging merchant power generators who control large portfolio=01,s of merc=
hant=20
power generation either through development or acquisition. We have asked =
=20
Mike Miller to assume the leadership of this group.  In addition, Mike will=
=20
continue to manage the power development activities in the Eastern=20
Interconnect;
d) Eastern QF Restructuring =01) This group will focus on the QF restructur=
ing=20
opportunities in the Eastern Interconnect including the existing=20
restructuring and re-capitalization of the East Coast Power assets.  We hav=
e=20
asked Dave Duran to assume the leadership of this business. Greg Blair,=20
formerly of Enron Asia=01,s development group, Doug Clifford, formerly of=
=20
Citizens power, and Dick Lydecker, formerly of Cogen Technology, will join=
=20
this newly formed business.

2) Commercial Transactions:=20

The Commercial Transactions Group (CTG), co-headed by Ray Bowen and Jeff=20
Donahue, was formed to provide a centralized resource for the execution of=
=20
transactions within ENA =01) and thereby, improve ENA=01,s efficiency in ex=
ecuting=20
transactions and free-up the origination groups to increase their intensity=
=20
of client coverage.  CTG consists of six primary functions: Transaction=20
Development, Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management, Commodity=20
Structuring and Transportation, Transactional Support/Accounting, Technical=
=20
Analysis and Upstream Asset Management.

The Transaction Development Group will be responsible for deal leadership,=
=20
execution and optimization of all aspects of a transaction in conjunction=
=20
with the originator. The function will be divided into four teams, each of=
=20
which will be dedicated to between two and four origination groups.  This=
=20
dedication to specific groups should provide a closer link, better service=
=20
and greater accountability with the origination groups; however, the CTG=20
resources are designed to be a fungible and flexible resource allocated to=
=20
the highest value transactions across the coverage functions:

a) Midstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Eastern and=
=20
Western Coverage/Origination Groups.  The senior members of this group=20
include Billy Lemmons, George McCormick, Erin Norris and Russ Porter. Billy=
=20
Lemmons joined Enron in 1992.  Most recently, he was the Vice-President of=
=20
Capital Structuring and Risk Management for EES. Russ Porter joins us today=
=20
from Dynegy where he was a manager with responsibilities for power=20
origination.
b) Downstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to ENA=01,s industr=
ial=20
origination efforts in Pulp and Paper, Petrochemicals and Refining,=20
Environmental Energy, Metals and Mining and other industries as coverage is=
=20
established.  The senior members of this team include Rodney Malcolm, Jay=
=20
Boudreaux, Finley Biggerstaff and Chris Helfrich.  We anticipate announcing=
=20
two to four more additions to this team within the next few weeks.
c) Generation Transaction Development will be dedicated to the IPP Merchant=
=20
Services and power plant development and QF Restructuring groups.  The seni=
or=20
members of this team include Thomas Suffield, Andy Kelemen, Kelly Mahmoud a=
nd=20
John House. Thomas Suffield joined Enron in 1996. Most recently, he was the=
=20
Vice-President of Origination for the Latin American group in Azurix.  We=
=20
anticipate announcing two more additions to this team within the next few=
=20
weeks.
d) Upstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Producer=20
Finance, Coal and Gas Assets groups.  The senior members of this team inclu=
de=20
Brad Dunn, John Curtin and Chris Hilgert.  We hope to announce the addition=
=20
of at least one VP to this group prior to yearend.

Ray Bowen will have primary oversight responsibilities for the Upstream and=
=20
Downstream Transaction Development teams with Jeff Donahue having primary=
=20
responsibilities for the Midstream and Generation teams.  Andrea Reed will=
=20
continue to head Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management: all junior=
=20
commercial resources within the Transaction Development teams will have dua=
l=20
responsibilities to both their Transaction Development teams and to the=20
Capital Structuring Group.  The remaining four groups within CTG will remai=
n=20
largely unchanged.  In addition, the Origination and the Transaction=20
Development teams and their respective origination groups will be located=
=20
together.

We believe that these changes will significantly enhance our market coverag=
e=20
and industry knowledge in all ENA=01,s markets particularly in the industri=
al=20
markets. It will also provide a closer partnership and accountability betwe=
en=20
the Coverage/Origination Groups and the CTG Groups.=20

Please help us in continuing to build on the success we have enjoyed in Nor=
th=20
America by working with us to implement these changes.
