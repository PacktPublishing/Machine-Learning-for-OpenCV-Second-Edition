Amy- -

Steve Kean and I finally got to discuss this the other day and we decided 
that this effort would likely be too time consuming and costly, particularly 
for certain key employees, to justify doing it.  It obviously is an 
interesting topic but one that would require alot of attention (and possibly 
money) to participate in fully.  Thanks for your attention to this.

Rick:
I'm assuming you had conference call w/ AA on Friday re: the New Value 
Research Lab effort - is that correct? We are ready to regroup this week and 
hear the results of your conversation. Pls advise as to your feedback and 
availability. 
Thanks.
