Over the next several months Enron will be phasing in a new expense-reporti=
ng=20
product, Concur Technologies=01, Expense Management System (XMS).  You will=
 be=20
able to prepare your expense report, send it for approval, and transmit it=
=20
for payment using the Intranet.  It will be far more user-friendly than the=
=20
Excel-based form currently in use and will provide a truly paperless=20
process.  In addition, the system efficiently integrates with the SAP=20
accounting system. =20

On October 16, employees who used a prior version of the product upgraded t=
o=20
the most current release.  On October 30, it will be available to Enron Cor=
p=20
employees, Company 0011.  The rollout to other groups will continue through=
=20
January 2001.  Rollout announcements will be made to each business unit.=20

In Houston, IT Central will provide four training sessions per week. To=20
enroll in a class go to itcentral.enron.com and click on=20
Services>Training>Schedules. Those in outlying locations and those who pref=
er=20
on-line training can use LEAP by signing on to sap.enron.com and clicking o=
n=20
Training, then LEAP.  Use xms (lower case) as the User ID and Password. =20

We are excited about this new system and hope you will find it useful.  If=
=20
you have questions regarding its use contact IT Central at (713) 345-4727 o=
