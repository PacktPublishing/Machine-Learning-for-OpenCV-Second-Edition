Molly,

We have a reasonably big room. 2-5 people is OK. It's EB1938.

I've got in on the calendar for the 18th at 2:00.  What's the location?  How 
many can we bring?  2 or 3?

Thanks.

Molly,

I met Lou in the building lobby last Wednesday and he suggested that he
(or his representatives) join the Mathworks presentation to my group).

It's a good software package for mathematical modeling,
 but there is a limit to the number of different installations any group
can productively use.

I shall take a look at some new features they offer
and decide whether it's worth the effort.

Hello Mr. Casari:

Myself and our Energy Trading Financial Team will be visiting with the R&D
group at Enron the week of 10/16/00.  They have several applications can be
dramatically improved with our tools.

We are very interested to understand the Bandwidth Trading Market, to see
if any additional challanges can be overcome with our tools. 

I would like to understand your challanges of modeling, simulating and
deploying applications to control risk.

Are you available to discuss these items prior to our visit?

I look forward to hearing from you.
Thanks
Scott Wakefield
