Hello to each of you.  I would like to let you know that I will be 
facilitating the 2000 Chairman's Award program, a Vision & Values initiative 
designed to recognize those employees who daily embody Enron's values of 
Respect, Integrity, Communication and Excellence.  This is an annual, 
employee-driven award which encourages employees to nominate their everyday 
heroes.

A critical component of the award process, and one in which Ken Lay has given 
his full support, is the Employee Selection Committee.  This year's Selection 
Committee is made up of a diverse representation from our workforce both in 
the US and around the world.  These individuals were chosen as last year's 
Chairman's Roundtable and have been invited to be part of this year's 
Employee Selection Committee.  Their infallible enthusiasm for Enron's Vision 
& Values will support the seamless transition from recognized winners to 
award decision-makers which is necessary to sustain the spirit of the award.

You are being notified because one of your employees is on this important 
committee.  The time commitment will be primarily during the first two weeks 
of October when we will meet either in person or via video / phone 
conferencing to review the nominations and select the winners.

I hope you will congratulate and support them as this is a special honor to 
be asked to serve on the Employee Selection Committee.  If you have any 
questions at any time, please feel free to contact me via email or phone.

Warm regards,

Charla Reese
