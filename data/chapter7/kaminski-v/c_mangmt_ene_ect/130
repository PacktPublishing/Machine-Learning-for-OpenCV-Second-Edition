Vince,

I left a message with one of Yaron's roommates on Thursday afternoon for him 
to call ASAP for an interview on Sunday.  I guess he took the wrong number 
down but I do not understand this because the roommate read the number back 
to me and it was correct.  When I did not hear from Yaron I called on Friday 
and left a voice mail with my cell and office numbers.  I still did not hear 
from him and called again yesterday morning.  I finally received a call at 4 
pm yesterday but by that time my team and myself were half way back to 
Houston.  Sorry it did not work out.  I have a call into Charlene Jackson as 
to how she wants me to proceed and I will get back with you.

Kristin

Vince
Apparently the recruiter spoke to one of my son's  roommates and left a phone 
number (713) 343-3214 which he tried several times  and got busy signals. 
Today she called just before you called me and left her  cellphone number but 
he was in classes all morning and got the message in the  afternoon. I really 
appreciate your going out of your?way to help. Perhaps  there will be another 
opportunity.?
Shmuel?
