I have several queries re the Avister charges for London, primarily because=
=20
the spreadsheet is based on a total of 24 London users.  We have a total of=
=20
14 Avistar users installed in London.=20

I believe the following London departments may have been charged for the=20
incorrect number of users:

Fin=01,l Trading  - $74,418.83  based on 4 units but have 5 users
Rate & Currency     (John Greene not listed?)
342-100467

Softs MG  - $42,857.23  based on 4 units but have only 1 user
1105-120415      (Nigel Majury)

Credit Derivitives - $16,168.42  based on 2 units but none installed
0342-102843      (3 users on Via Video pilot)

Liquids   - $56,589.46  based on 7 units but only 6 installed
872C-104546      (Niamh Clarke no longer based in London)

Shankman London - $16,168.42  based on 2 units but none installed
0342-103058      (Brad Hitch/Merrill Thomas no longer in dept.)

EEL-Exec  - $8,084.21  based on 1 unit for John Sherriff who is
0342-100309      on Via Video pilot - Avistar not installed

Legal London  - $8,084.21  based on 1 unit for Michael Brown- Avistar=20
0342-100348      not installed

London IT  - $16,168.42  based on two units but only one required
0342-100348      to administer system

The above figures are based on an original average $10,276 per seat. =20
However, a base change from 24 to 14 seats would increase the per seat char=
ge=20
to $17,616.

We also ought to look at charging out the ISDN calls charges for the Avista=
r=20
system (in the region of $187,000 for 4 months).
