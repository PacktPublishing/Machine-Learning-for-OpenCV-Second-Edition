As our existing businesses grow and new businesses are created, ease of=20
movement and development of our top talent becomes essential to our success=
. =20
As you heard at the Management Conference all officers will be titled,=20
reviewed, promoted, and compensated according to a more standard set of=20
guidelines.  The process recognizes the intrinsic value of each officer,=20
rather than tying that individual to the value of their specific job or=20
reporting relationship.

Officer titling has been standardized throughout Enron.  There are four=20
levels of officers: members of the Enron Office of the Chairman make up Lev=
el=20
4.  Level 3 includes all other members of the Enron Executive Committee. =
=20
Level 2 is made up of managing directors, including company presidents and=
=20
some senior vice presidents.  Level 1 are vice presidents and some senior=
=20
vice presidents with grandfathered titles.

This year a common evaluation process is being implemented for Level 1 and=
=20
Level 2 officers.  Officers will be evaluated by a committee, through a=20
process referred to as the Performance Review Committee (PRC), utilizing a=
=20
standard set of performance criteria and performance ratings.  Performance=
=20
committee reviews will occur twice a year =01) in July for feedback purpose=
s and=20
at year-end for feedback as well as bonus and total compensation=20
considerations.  The Executive Committee will handle the PRC for all Level =
2=20
officers. Review of Level 1 officers will occur at the business-unit level=
=20
first with the results =01&cross calibrated=018 by the Executive Committee =
and a=20
group of approximately sixteen managing directors.

The goals of the PRC process is to insure a consistent standard for our=20
overall pool of executive talent and to provide a tool to more effectively=
=20
utilize talent throughout the organization.  To further promote consistency=
=20
the Executive Committee will consider all promotions in January of each=20
year.  Exceptions, internally or externally, will be infrequent.

The individual=01,s performance evaluation will be the starting point for a=
ll=20
compensation decisions.  Compensation includes base pay, bonus and long-ter=
m=20
awards.  A long-term program that replaces individual or business unit plan=
s=20
has been approved and will be communicated to individuals before bonus=20
payments are made.

In addition to the Level 1 and Level 2 reviews, business unit, global and=
=20
corporate cross-functional PRC reviews for directors, senior directors and=
=20
general managers have started.  This year-end process will be utilized as a=
=20
benchmark to determine how we further refine the evaluation process at this=
=20
level in the future.
