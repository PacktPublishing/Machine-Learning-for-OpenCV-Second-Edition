NOTE FROM MARK FREVERT

With the wide and varied activities of our three organizations, we created=
=20
this e-mail newsletter to keep everyone better informed about our various=
=20
businesses.  I hope you find it informative and more importantly, that you=
=20
will use this newsletter to help spread the word about the successes in you=
r=20
group.

To provide content for future e-mails, contact Michelle Vitrella in our=20
Public Relations group via e-mail or call her at ext. 3-9767.  Communicatio=
n=20
is one of the core Enron values and I believe this is a great way to improv=
e=20
communication across our wholesale businesses.

Additionally, I would like to again encourage everyone to take a few minute=
s=20
to complete =01&The Pulse=018 survey.  This annual survey regarding the wor=
k=20
experience at Enron and how we can make it better is an important part of t=
he=20
two-way communication process at Enron.  Please go to the Enron intranet an=
d=20
type survey.enron.com.  It only takes a few minutes, it=01,s confidential a=
nd=20
your comments will help make Enron a better place to work.
