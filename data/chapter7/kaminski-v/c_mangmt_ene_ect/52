Good Morning!

Thank you for taking time out of a busy Friday to allow our photographer to 
shoot some pictures for the ENSIDE.  I will contact you when the proofs are 
ready.

I have attached the article draft with revisions by Mike, Osman and Iris.  
Please peruse this draft and make any changes or corrections. I need it back 
for the layout team by Wednesday evening, April 4, if possible.

Regards,
Kathie Grabstald
