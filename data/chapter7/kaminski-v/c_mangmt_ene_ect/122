Thank you for volunteering your time for this weekend's Super Saturday.  We 
appreciate your commitment to Enron's recruiting success.  At this time we do 
have an adequate number of Friday night dinner participants and will not need 
you to sacrifice your Friday evening.  If you haven't already,  we encourage 
you to volunteer for one of our other future Super Saturdays.  

Thank you again for your support and your participation.
Shelly Jones
