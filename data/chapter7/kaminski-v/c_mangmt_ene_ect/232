Today is a big day for ENRON!  This morning, we are rolling out the next st=
ep=20
toward empowering our most valuable resource -- you.  As of this morning,=
=20
most of you have access to the new eHRonline intranet site.

The new eHRonline functionality (a feature of the SAP implementation) is ve=
ry=20
easy to use and is accessible through the Enron intranet (at=20
http://ehronline.enron.com).  Using eHRonline, not only can you enter your=
=20
own time, but also maintain your profile, and update personal data, includi=
ng=20
home address, phone numbers, W-4 changes and emergency contact information.=
 =20
Additionally, you will be able to view your individual pay advice and benef=
it=20
elections.

Remember the deadline for time entry is 3:00 pm CST, on June 30th -- all ti=
me=20
must be submitted and ready for payroll processing.  Because this is the=20
first period using SAP to record time, please work closely with your=20
timekeeper to ensure the deadline is met. By now, you should have received =
a=20
note from your timekeeper.  However, if you have not and are unsure who you=
r=20
timekeeper is, please call the Site Manager for your Business Unit.  Their=

Because of the size of this rollout, we have to expect a few "bumps in the=
=20
road."  So, we=01,re asking you to be patient and work with us over the nex=
t few=20
weeks.  If you have questions, are experiencing problems, or would like mor=
e=20
information, please contact the Center of Expertise (COE).
