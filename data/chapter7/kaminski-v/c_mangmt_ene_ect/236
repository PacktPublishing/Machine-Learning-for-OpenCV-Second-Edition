As a reminder, the Summer Associate Program is an integral and critical part 
of our recruiting efforts.  You have been asked to act as mentors for Summer 
Associates who attend the schools for which you have recruiting 
responsibility.  You were invited to meet the Summer Associates at a  
reception being held at the Sierra Grill, located at 4704 Montrose, on 
Thursday, June 22nd from 6:00 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.

To date several of you have not responded.  Please respond to Cheryl Kuehl 
(ext. 3-9804) by Tuesday, June 20th.  If you are unable to attend, please 
advise Cheryl that you intend to make other arrangements to meet your Summer 
Associate so that she may advise the Associate not to look for you at the 
reception.  We thank you for your co-operation and your efforts to assist 
will not go unnoticed.

Jeff and Joe
