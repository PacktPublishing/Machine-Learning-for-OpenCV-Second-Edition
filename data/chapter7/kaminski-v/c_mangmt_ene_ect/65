coverage strategy.  Since then, EPMI has begun to develop relationships wit=
h=20
hundreds of small =01&mom & pop=018 municipalities.  Many of these munis ha=
d no=20
prior contact with Enron.  As a result, East Power has executed a valuable =
30=20
MW energy call option term purchase from the Municipal Energy Agency of=20
Nebraska (MEAN) at a congested location.

Enron Industrial Markets
EIM has renamed Pulp, Paper & Lumber to Forest Products in order to fully=
=20
encompass our multiple product offerings.

Open Forum Editorial in The San Francisco Chronicle  by Kenneth Lay    3/1/=
01
What has happened in California over the past four years is not=20
deregulation.  It is misguided regulation.=20

Deregulation does not mean eliminating customer choice and competition for=
=20
most customers.
Deregulation does not mean limiting new market entrants.  Fewer than five=
=20
percent of customers in California are served by competing suppliers.

Deregulation does not mean creating a single central power pool from which=
=20
all participants must buy and sell their wholesale power; the state Power=
=20
Exchange effectively replaced three monopoly buyers with one monopoly buyer=
.

Deregulation does not mean buying all of your commodity at the last minute,=
=20
on the spot market, rather than planning ahead and purchasing most of the=
=20
power under long-term contracts that lock in prices.

The situation in California is the result of continued regulation,=20
complicated by a series of natural and man-made factors.
