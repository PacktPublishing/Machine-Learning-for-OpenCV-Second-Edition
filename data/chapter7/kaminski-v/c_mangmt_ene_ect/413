 I have recently come on board as Treasurer ,Enron India . Prior to joining , 
I was with Reliance Industries , a petrochemical conglomerate in India.
   The  Central banking authorities are now thinking of permitting 
corporates  to hedge their oil and other related risks. I believe the 
literature published
 by Risk in collaboration with Enron has come to be considered as an  
industry standard. Would it be possible to arrange for two copies to be sent 
across to us .
 
Thanx N Regards

G.Subramaniam
