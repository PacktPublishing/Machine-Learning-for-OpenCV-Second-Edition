Hi Jeff,

	My research colleagues and I are working on a document to lay out our credit derivatives modeling strategy.  For lack of a better term, we refer to this as our credit business plan.

	It is my understanding that various business plans have been previously written for the credit group - one by Gillian Johnson and another by John Bottomley.

	It would be very helpful to our efforts in the research group, it you would allow us to see these plans.

Thanks,
Iris
