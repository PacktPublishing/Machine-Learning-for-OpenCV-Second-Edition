Bryan,

I talked to Vasant about the model review in London. He thought that he could 
accomplish this from Houston,
but I think direct  communication makes things much easier. I think his trip 
to London
makes a lot of sense. KMV confirmed the meeting on the 20th. We hope to get 
more information about
the scope of their model and assess its the applicability to your business.
Vasant, after a few days of immersion in your operations, will be able to 
assess better the usefulness of the
model.

Vince

vince - it is highly unlikely that I can make the trip but I spoke with 
vasant today and he will try to get to london beforehand and will have good 
idea of our needs.  hopefully this will not cause too many problems.
