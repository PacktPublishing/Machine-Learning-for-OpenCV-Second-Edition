Subject: Private Firm Schedule

All:

This is the rough schedule we came up with at today's video conference:

Submit RFP to D&B, Experian, and Amadeus 2 days  25 Apr  Mumford
Receive back RFPs     1.5 weeks 4 May  Mumford
Complete evaluation, selection & authorization 1 week  11 May  Mumford/Mack
Contract complete and signed   2 weeks 25 May  Mumford
Data to Iris & Amitava    3 weeks 15 June  Mumford
Model Development Complete   4 weeks 15 July  Mack
*Integration of model and data feeds into CTS 6 weeks 30 August Kirkpatrick

Prior to integration into CTS any prices would have to be manually uploaded 
into CTS via spreadsheet. 

The RFP will include a request for a smaller data calibration set that we may 
select to purchase immediately.

We can revisit this schedule at our Wednesday Video Conference.
