Hi Jeff,

 My research colleagues and I are working on a document to lay out our credit 
derivatives modeling strategy.  For lack of a better term, we refer to this 
as our credit business plan.

 It is my understanding that various business plans have been previously 
written for the credit group - one by Gillian Johnson and another by John 
Bottomley.

 It would be very helpful to our efforts in the research group, it you would 
allow us to see these plans.

Thanks,
Iris
