Subject: Risk article

Everyone should read the attached Risk article about calculating def probs 
from CDS quotes. 

Amazingly it is in pretty close agreement with our own methodology for both 
CDS valuation and reverse engineering def probs. The only extension in the 
reverse engineering is that instead of linearly interpolating CDS quotes, 
they propose minimising an error measure based on 'smoothness' of def prob 
curve and difference between model and market prices. 

What is also amazing is the fact that this article has been published in 
Risk, given that it is essentially the same as my credit pricing paper, plus 
one excellent idea. Given extra time, resources and brainpower, there is no 
reason why we shouldn't have similar work published ourselves.
