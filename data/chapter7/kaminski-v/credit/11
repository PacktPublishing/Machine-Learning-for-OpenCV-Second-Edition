Hi Ben,


	I think I have read all the papers that are to be used in the comparative model study to be sent to Professor Duffie at Stanford.  

	These documents are all listed below.   Please let me know if I have omitted any (However, don't get the impression that I am begging for more papers to read).

	Now I will try to transform my notes into a draft for Professor Duffie.

Thanks,
Iris
