Ed,

Louise must be very busy. I sent her another message regarding your request.
I shall call her if there is no reply from her within 3 days. 

Please, let me know.

Vince

Dear Vince,

I have not heard from Louise and assume I cannot access Enrononline. As a
result, I have written what I can discern in the attached draft chapter for
the Risk Guide to Electricity Hedging. Could you review the Enrononline
section and let me know if I have any factual errors? Obviously, I welcome
any other comments you might have.

Don't warry about any textual problems -- me editors will catch those.
English is, after all, my thrid language (he said, defensively).

Sorry I couldn't gain access. Enrononline looks interesting and the stock
market seems to be giving you a strong pat on the back. Well done.

Thanks for your help.

Ed Krapels

Ed,

I sent a message to Louise Kitchen who runs the EnronOnline effort.
She should be getting back to you shortly.

Dear Vince,

Greetings from Boston, where we're doing all we can to help keep the price
of gas high.

As I may have told you earlier, I'm writing a "Guide to Electricity Hedging"
for Risk Publications similar to the report on Oil. I had planned to write a
significant section on Enrononline, and in the midst of my research on the
topic was denied access by Enron's gatekeeper. Can you help get me in?

As always, the best from here.

Ed Krapels
