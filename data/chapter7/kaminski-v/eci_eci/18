Nick,

Sorry for the delay in my reply.   August the 21st will work the best, since 
Jim Fallon (head trader for bandwidth) will be out the following week.   We 
will set up a meeting with him.   Kevin Hannon is out, however, and there is 
no need for you to stay for dinner if you prefer to head back earlier in the 
afternoon.

Should you want help in making any travel arrangements,  our assistant 
Shirley Crenshaw (713 853 5290) would be happy to help you.

thanks and look forward to your visit,

Stinson
