Stinson,

Just a quick note to let you know that I am looking into it,
trying to rearrange a couple of things. I'd like Giuseppe and
possibly Eric to come with me, so I need to coordinate with
them too. We've made some nice progress that I'd like to present
and also integrate Eric in the system.

I am targeting a Friday around the end of February or begining
of March. I'll let you know soon of a few possibilities as they
stabilize here.

Best,

Nick
