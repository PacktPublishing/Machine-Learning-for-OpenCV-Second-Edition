April, I'll be in Colorado until March 10.  We can schedule next week or you 
can talk to him directly.  Currently, EBS research is helping Kevin Howard 
and Scott Yeager (indirectly via Kevin) in their effort to assess the value 
of an eyeball.  Paulo's research will complement this effort.  The research 
that Paulo will perform for you will be part of a bigger picture work that 
Kevin Howard has aked Stinson and I to support.    You can call me on my cell 
713-516-5440 while I am in CO.

Regards,

Ravi.

April:

Paulo is the MIT Ph.D. student who talked with you by phone a couple of weeks 
ago.   He is interested in trying to better define what type of project he 
might do over the summer with EBS.   Recall that he is interested in the 
psychological/customer behavior issues related to web commerce as compared to 
traditional commerce.   Perhaps the easiest way to proceed would be for you, 
me, Ravi, and Vince to get together to discuss possibilities.   We could then 
include Paulo by phone to get his initial reactions/suggestions.   After an 
initial assessment, we could then plan on another visit for Paulo.

Please let me know what your schedule would allow.

thanks,
--Stinson

Stinson -

Thanks for your reply.  I just got a call from someone at Enron today about
Summer employment, so I think a meeting with April and your group would be
very appropriate at this time.

I am available to meet with April  any day this coming month, except March
9, March 10, and March 17-30.

Please let me know what works for you.

Thanks again,

Paulo
