Hi Stinson, Shales' initial in road to EBS was through David Cox (after 
Vince's suggest to talk to David, I think).  What Shalesh did at the time was 
to put a four page concept on trading storage as a commodity in the new 
networked world.  He has keen interest in such an idea and has done some 
work. He will be a good fit unless that person has to be in EBS under Jean 
etc.... If so, we are not ready to let Shalesh go!  He can support that 
effort, but I need him to get the supply & demand work in real-time user 
friendly form for Jean's traders before Shalesh ventures onto something 
else.  I did promising that I will get him involved in some juicy stuff like 
new product/deals etc.... This may be his non-it stuff that he can do.....

What do you think?

Ravi.

Ravi:

Samer and I met this morning with Sara Ledbetter.   She is starting the 
groundwork for setting up a storage book and a streaming book for tracking 
the e-powered products positions.    They are having a meeting on next 
Tuesday to discuss this.  Samer will attend.    This is a good opportunity to 
start compiling the data that we will need for some of John Grieblings 
questions.

p.s.   Sara also asked if we knew anyone who would be interested in managing 
the storage book.  Any suggestions?
