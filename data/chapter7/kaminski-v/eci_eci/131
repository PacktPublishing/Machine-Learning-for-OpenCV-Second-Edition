Hi Kristy, please track down electronic form of the four students that we 
interviewed (2 stanford, 2 MIT).  If you need help, feel free to talk to 
Vince to find out which one he has etc....

Vince, there will be Salal from MIT coming in March 5th (I think, Kristy 
please confirm).  He is very qualified and most like a good fit. So, please 
let HR know that we may add a couple, etc.

Ravi.

Ravi,

Our compensation for summer interns is very generous. It's more than what an 
engineering student expects.

Vince

P.S.  Any progress on the resumes in electronic form? I want to send a 
package to Charlene today.

Vince

Hi, Vince please put your best effort in making sure that we differentiate 
summer interns and associates that EBS Research will be hiring.  I am talking 
about compensation here.  Ken Rice mentioned that EBS is in the process of 
developing a technical equivalent of our AA pool. EBS research people can 
potentially rotate through this pool in the future.  I just don't want to 
risk losing people like Giuseppe (& get the word out that we are low-ballers) 
because we have to fit them into certain set of categories that was designed 
for the energy business.  I realize that you have estabilished such 
differentiation for research as a whole, but I think that would have to be 
moved up a notch in the case of EBS.

Ravi.
