Omar, thanks for the presentation and the e-mail.  As I tried to emphasize on 
the phone call, there will be short-term and long-term efforts to utilize 
OPNET. Often the short-term needs rules at EBS.  We will sort out what they 
during our discussion in Houston.  I am confirming the meeting in Houston 
6-8th.

I shall ask Shirely Crenshaw to arrange for a conference room on the 19th 
floor. The meeting will be held all day from April 6th, 7th and half day 8th. 
The 8th is a saturday and the meeting will be held to wrap things up if 
needed.

Ravi.





Background info. for Enron Research People.  OPNET is a simulation tool that 
many in the industry use to do capacity planning to IP based applications and 
services on a network.  Detail adenda will follow.

I wanted to take the opportunity to thank you for the time we had this
morning to discuss the performance engineering program at EBS. I think
you'll find that the value to Enron from the overall approach is quite
high. I have a much better picture now of some of the short term drivers
that need to be addressed as we move forward. As I work with you, I think
we'll quickly emerge with a clear picture of what needs to be done and when.

As soon as you confirm your schedule for April 6-8, I'll book my travel to
get to Houston. I've already put in a call to OPNET Technologies to have
them get a resource out to Houston on one of those days for a demonstration
and Q & A about the OPNET toolset.

I'll compose an agenda for us to use during that meeting in Houston and get
it out to you next week.

If there are any questions, please email me at

ozaidi@lucent.com

You can also call me at 503 778 0653. I am also pageable at 1 800 467 1467.

Have a great weekend and I look forward to hearing from you next week about
the April 6-8 meeting.

Best wishes....
