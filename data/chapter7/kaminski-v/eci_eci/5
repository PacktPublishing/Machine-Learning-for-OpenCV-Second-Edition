Barry,

Thanks for the timely email.   I have your name on my list of people to 
contact this week as Kevin Hannon had mentioned to me just yesterday that our 
group might be able to help you in translating positions for the new risk 
system for EBS.    

You are right that I haven't been spending much time on 44.   Martin Lin has 
been taking the lead in day to day management of most of the current projects 
that we are supporting.   We have been somewhat short handed since Samer 
Takriti left the group last fall and we were out-bid by McKinsey for Cantekin 
Dincerler who had helped us with EBS projects as an intern over the 
summer.    However, we do have additional help coming.   Iris Mack, a very 
bright new hire who comes with significant consulting and risk management 
experience, will be starting with the group next week.   I am hoping that, 
together with Martin, she will allow us to significantly increase the 
research group presence on 44 and address areas which are currently 
undersupported.

Can I get on your schedule some time next week in order to map out the areas 
where we could best contribute to the risk management projects and to 
introduce Iris and Martin to you?   Almost any time would be fine, or you can 
have your assistant coordinate with Shirley Crenshaw x35290.

Regards,

Stinson
