Kevin,

I have followed up on your request to identify a potential hire
from Akamai (a person familiar with their technology). We can start 
discussions with the targets in a few days.

Please, let me know which unit in EBS is a potential hiring agent.
If it's Research, who inside EBS can sponsor  this position? We have to 
discuss
the responsibilities and job description.

Vince
