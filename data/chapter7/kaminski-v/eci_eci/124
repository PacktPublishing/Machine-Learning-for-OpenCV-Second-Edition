Hi Vince, Scott Pleus (listed below in the director promotion section) is=
=20
bandwidth-trading backoffice person we=01,ve been working with.  I have kno=
wn=20
Scott from EBS since he and I started around the same time. In fact, I was=
=20
one of the first people to talk to Sally Beck about booking some of our=20
network positions=01*at which time I met Scott.   I know we have discussed =
this=20
matter many times before, but this is a specific example of how people at a=
ll=20
functional areas are benefiting from EBS' rapid 'growth.'  Scott has been a=
t=20
Enron for about the same time I have been. He came from another energy=20
company's backoffice before that. =20

As for my specific situation, after our discussion yesterday, I understand=
=20
clearly what happened. It appears bad luck had a lot to do with it!!!

Thanks for looking into the promotion in the first place and I am certain=
=20
that you'll push the promotion through at the earliest convenience of the H=
R=20
folks!

Kind Regards,

Ravi.
