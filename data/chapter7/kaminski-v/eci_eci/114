Hi Gene, looks like you are dealing with the subject.  Thanks for moving this 
forward. KMI is dancing around relatively minor issues that I think we should 
be able to overcome. Essentially, the issue is that we will not resell their 
database or misrepresent it.  They want to put in all this restriction about 
not using it for trading, exchange, etc. stretches our possible usage of this 
database.  It appears from your e-mail that the attament therein is our 
standard agreement that we get our vendors to sign.  At this point, I am 
happy with whatever it takes to get those guys to close the deal.

Thank you very much for the prompt service,

Regards,

Ravi.
