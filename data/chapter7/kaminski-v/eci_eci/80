Hello!

The 29th will be fine--if we can definitely get everything in by then.  I 
just worry a little when we start getting less than a month out.  We need to 
make sure that our Conference Services office has enough time to detail all 
of your functions properly so that everything flows smoothly.

Also please know that the availability of those $274 airfares is also not 
guaranteed until booked (you know how those airlines are about changing fares 
around).  We need to be able to book a specific class of service to get that 
fare, so once those are gone the fare cannot be guaranteed.  Do you want me 
to get started with the air contract?

Please keep me posted!  Thanks!

Steve

Good morning Steve:

I received your voice mail and the flight information sounds great!

I need to update you as to the status of everything at present.

   The contract is fine, however, I am not authorized to sign it, so if it is
   allright, we are putting "John Griebling's" name in my place.  He will 
sign 
   the contract and we will put the charges on his credit card.

   However, John is out of town and will not be back in until tomorrow.  This
   may cut it a little close as to getting everything back to you by Monday,
   the 27th.  Is there a possibility of getting this deadline pushed back a 
   couple of days?  We are also having a problem getting a commitment from 
the 
   top management people - they are all out of town at present.  This does not
   involve very many - only 3 or 4 people, but we need to get a definate 
count 
   so that we won't be short on rooms.  If everyone can come, it looks like 
we 
   might need at least 39 rooms.

   We should be able to have everthything to you by the 29th - is this a
   problem?

Please let me know as soon as possible.

Thanks and have a great day!
