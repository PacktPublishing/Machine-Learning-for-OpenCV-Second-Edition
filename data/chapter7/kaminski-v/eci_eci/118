Hi Vince, Mark Holsworth reviewed our contract on such a short notice.  I 
thank Mark for responding to our short-notice request.  It turns out that we 
need to get this database to move forward on a number of things and have 
legal save some time for us is an excellent help.  As mentioned below, It 
appears that PennWell's folks want to chat some more about this. 

Mark, can you schedule a conference call with these people to finalise this 
contract.  I will be out of town all week next week on a lock-down deal 
meeting. Vince may be able to get on the conference call.  I would greatly 
appreciate it if you could help us close this one!

Regards,

Ravi.

Ravi -

I would like to schedule a conference call between you, me, PennWell's
counsel (Toni Turner Budd), and Enron's counsel to discuss your changes and
finalize the KMI End-User License Agreement.  I propose that we have the
conference call at 2:00 PM CST this Monday, February 21.  Please let me know
if you are available at this time and, if not, propose an alternative time
for the call.  In addition, please provide me with a telephone number where
I can reach you for the conference call.

PennWell is looking forward to finalizing the license agreement and
delivering the KMI data to Enron.

Yours truly,

Russell Iorio
