Joe,

I would like to invite you to an off-site meeting of John Griebling's 
organization
and the Research Group. 

Date:   April 27 - April 29
Location:  Breckenridge, Colorado


As you know, John Griebling is managing the network design and construction 
project
currently under way in EBS. The Research Group is actively involved in this 
effort
which requires advanced quantitative skills in the area of stochastic 
optimization and
stochastic processes (for modeling and forecasting Internet traffic flows).

The objective of this meeting is to develop common language and accomplish 
transfer 
of skills between the two groups, to facilitate cooperation on this project 
in the future.

We are inviting Ken Rice and Kevin Hannon to this meeting. We would 
appreciate if you could
speak, together with Kevin and Ken, on strategic directions of EBS. It is 
important for a group
of technical people, with relatively specialized technical skills, to 
understand the big picture.

I am attaching the preliminary agenda for this meeting.

Vince Kaminski
