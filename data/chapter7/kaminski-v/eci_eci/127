Hi Phil, here are the logistical details for our meetings next week at
Sycamore in Chelmsord (10 Elizabeth Drive).

Hotel:  Double Tree in Lowell.
Transportation:  Everyone should fly into Boston Monday afternoon/early
evening. Chelmsford is about 40-45 minutes from the airport, more in
traffic.  I can arrange for a car service from the Airport to the Restaurant
Monday night for everyone, and have the limo wait for you until we are
through with dinner (then everyone can leave there bags in the limo).  If
some or all want to use this car service, I'll need their flight information
by Friday afternoon so I can make arrangements.

Here is the agenda for next week:

Monday:  Dinner at 7:30pm - Agresti's restaurant, 175 Littleton Rd,
Westford, MA. Directions will immediately follow this email.

Thursday Meetings at Sycamore 8:30am - 4:00pm
