Hi Ravi--

Thanks for you note. I would be very interested in a meeting to establish a=
n=20
EBS-wide approach to storage. It's a huge opportunity.
We could expand the 2:30pm Friday meeting to include all interested EBS=20
people and discuss the topics below. Could Shalesh coordinate this meeting=
=20
and also coordinate the ongoing effort firm-wide? Have I omitted anything=
=20
below?

As I see it, here are the key storage initiatives that EBS should undertake=
,=20
and who is involved up to this point.=20

1. - establish storage contract terms and pricing
Who's involved: Virawan, Jean Mrha Beach
 a.  define terms for storage needed for EBS products (MediaCast,=20
MediaTransport, and new products)
 b.  define general terms for other storage contracts

2. - establish storage pooling points (SPP)
Who's involved: Shalesh, Richard Reichardt, Mark Palmer, Kara Knop
Who's needed: other designated people from Bloomer and Griebling groups, Ji=
m=20
Crowder's group input on alliances
 a.  define technology needed
  servers, storage devices
  control software for physical delivery
 b.  decide optimal SPP locations
  at/near existing bandwidth trading pooling points
  at/near existing EBS city PoPs
  at a hosting partner location
 c.  engage optimal partners to create SPP
  IBM
   IBM Global Services
   Tivioli (storage management software)
  EMC
  Sun
  Compaq
  existing storage portal vendors (e.g. Storage Networks)

3. - establish storage trading benchmark
Who's involved: unknown
Who's needed: Research group
 a.  define unit of measure for trading contract (e.g., terabyte-month)
 b.  establish pricing mechanisms

4. - identify (and monetize) storage market opportunites
Who's involved: unknown
Who's needed: Cox's group, Bloomer's group
 a.  storage intermediation opportunities
 b.  establish Virtual Storage Portal service for EBS

Hi Mark, I have not met you yet but heard a lot of good things about you.  =
I=20
would like to discuss with you and possibly with John Bloomer and Richard=
=20
Reichardt about the EBS Research's role in supporting the Storage market=20
development from the origination and trading perspective.  There are severa=
l=20
people in various groups that are talking about storage but here is what's =
my=20
take on our involvement--please correct me or suggest otherwise. =20

Shalesh Ganjoo is our lead analyst on this effort.  In addition to his effo=
rt=20
with your group, he is presently supporting Jean Mrha with pricing and=20
standardization for a traded storage maret--Stinson Gibner is directly=20
supervising him in this effort.

Shalesh came to us through referal from David Cox--David discovered him at=
=20
one of his speaking engagements.  Shalesh had talked to David about traded=
=20
storage market development some time last October and David refered Shalesh=
=20
to Enron Research group. We hired Shalesh for general analyst position and=
=20
now he is pulled into all aspect of this storage effort.  Currently, he is=
=20
our point person (with Stinson or I supervising his effort) who is supporti=
ng=20
Jean Mrha and you on the subject.  Kara Knop has aproached Shalesh with=20
request for some support and Shalesh and she are sorting out each other=01,=
s=20
role in this regard.  As per my discussion today with David, we need to=20
coordinate this storage effort from the perspective of modeling market=20
assessment etc. For this I suggest Shalesh and his effort so that all parti=
es=20
involved can benefit from collective effort within one central source.  Bas=
ed=20
on David's and my assessment of Shalesh's capabilities, I would like to=20
suggest that the commercial heads use Shalesh for his creative thinking,=20
understanding of the market and analytical capabilities and not just for da=
ta=20
gathering and simple research effort. We can add other staff as we see the=
=20
need and as you request them.=20

Please respond this e-mail with your comments if this sounds like aplan, so=
=20
that we can support this effort efficiently and in a scalable manner.

Kind Regards,

Ravi.
