This guy has basic quant skills, etc.  but at EBS we would need interns 
possible from MBA schools, not PhD.  I think he is a summer intern fit for 
Enron research and we can loop him into EBS research as we need help (which 
is likely).

Ravi.

Stinson,

Should we get him as well?
It seems he has the right skills. 
We might have maxed out on the
number of summer interns through
the A/A program. We would have to
hire him directly.

Hi Ravi:

I had sent an email about a week back with my resume for the summer
internship. I think the address I sent it to was not correct, so I am
resending it. I will also tell the others in the group to send there resumes
to you. Thanks.

Regards,
Shikhar
