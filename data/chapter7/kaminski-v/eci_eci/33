Dale,
Omer Muften (with the structuring group) asked us to help in evaluating the 
different options embedded in the Storm contract. However, he promised to 
provide us with the forward curves regarding the dark fiber (in Europe). We 
are still waiting to receive those. In addition, it seems that the deal 
structure has "just" changed. I will give you a call to discuss.
