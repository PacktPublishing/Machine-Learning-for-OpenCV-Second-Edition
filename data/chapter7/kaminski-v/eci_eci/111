Hello all:

Appended below you'll find a summary of ideas that people have contributed
since we at CAIDA began to get the metrics wg started.  Some of this
material has already appeared on the metrics mailing list, the older
material comes from personal emails.  I'm posting it again to give us all
some more ideas to think about.

For those who are able to attend the WG meeting in San Jose this Thursday
(2 Mar), I'd like to spend time in the morning getting to know about
attendees interests and experience in making Internet measurements.
I suggest that a good way to do this would be to have each group give a
short (10 minutes, <= 5 slides) presentation of their measurement work.
That should allow us to make a longer list of metrics to discuss in
more detail for the rest of the meeting.

Comments please!  I'll send out a revised/updated agenda late tomorrow.

Cheers, Nevil

PS: We now have about 40 people on the mailing list.  Please copy all
    further 'metrics' email to the list so that we can all see it.
    (We now have a web-searchable list archive in place at
    http://www.caida.org/archives/metrics/ )

Several people have expressed interest in passive measurements
on TCP streams.  One simple example is keeping track of DNS response times.

Daniel McRobb offered the following ..

Paul Krumviede highlighted the difficulty of agreeing on details
of how to measure common metrics like availability, reliability,
throughput and latency.

Nevil Brownlee comments that he's also very interested in
developing the RTFM meter as a platform for more general measurements.
Two areas seem interesting (apart from getting more information
from TCP streams):~
 + QoS / DifServ performance
      (what metrics do we need to characterise this?)
 + IPSEC (what metrics will still be useful when we can't
      look at port numbers?  what kinds of traffic can still be
      identified?)

This would provide a general way of determining where packets came from,
not just a tool for tracing DoS attacks.
