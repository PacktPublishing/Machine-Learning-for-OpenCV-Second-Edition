Mike,

I work for Enron Transportation and Storage in their Storage Marketing 
group.  My group has been using technical analysis from your website to help 
make daily storage trading revenue decisions.  On your web site, you 
indicated you would be discontinueing some of the information we use.  We had 
interviewed external technical service profiders, and chose not to buy their 
service because we had your information available to us to help us make 
financial decisions.  Specifically, we need the candlestick charts and 
analysis on natural gas, and we also need the elliot wave analysis on natural 
gas.  

Can you please reconsider your decision to discontinue the technical analysis 
data aforementioned?


Sue Neville
