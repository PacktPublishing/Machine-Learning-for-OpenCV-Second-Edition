We're at the point in the project where we are soliciting comments on a draft 
FERC filing we'd like to file at the end of the month.  If you would, please 
review our filing, with particular emphasis on product definition, position 
management and how we described in footnote [generally] how the marketplace 
would evaluate the option fees.

You help in this project is greatly appreciated.
