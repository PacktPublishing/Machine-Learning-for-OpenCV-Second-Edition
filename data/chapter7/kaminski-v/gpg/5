Mike,

Our department has been using your technical analysis to support commercial 
decisions.  You stated that these services would be discontinued.  We opted 
to use your technical analysis in lieu of outside services.  Please continue 
to provide technical analysis data with regard to natural gas (candlestick 
and Elliot wave).
