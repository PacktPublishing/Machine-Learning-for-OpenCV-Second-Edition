Conrad,

Thanks for your message.

There are 3 papers Enron contributed to the last MEPR.

There is also another paper on electricity I contributed to the "red book" on 
US
power markets, as well as a paper or credit risk management, and a paper
on weather derivatives. All these papers included in other RISK books were 
written by Enron 
employees.

We would like them included as well, if technically possible.


I think that offering other energy related books through our site, in 
addition to MEPR2,
is fine, but I would leave the decision to Dan Diamond, who is responsible 
for the project.


Vince

>Regarding the Enron site, I think it is absolutely fine to put up the two
Enron chapters (I'll provide pdfs), and prevent any customer leakages from
your site by the use of "submit" buttons. As mentioned, I'll offer a 20%
discount on MEPR2 to customers but would you be interested in some of other
energy titles? - Please let me know.
