Hi Vince,
?
Hope you are fine. I hope that Grant's  leaving?hasn't affected your group 
too much?
?
EPRM's Paul Bristow has been in touch about a VaR  training course involving 
Les, yourself and I. Are you interested? We would  be?extremely happy to work 
with you. He was talking about London and  Houston which I don't know if it 
fits with your travel schedule. Maybe we can  sort something out.
?
I hope to have the next article with you by early  next week.
?
Best regards as always, and many thanks for your  book promotional efforts!
?
Chris.
