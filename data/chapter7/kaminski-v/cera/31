Mr. Vincent J. Kaminski

Dear Mr. Kaminski: 

In response to client requests we are pleased to provide "A Brief History of 
the Future," by CERA's Julian West. 

TO REQUEST YOUR COMPLIMENTARY COPY OF THIS REPORT, PLEASE REPLY TO THIS 
MESSAGE.? We will forward an electronic (PDF) copy to you via email.

The report is based on Julian's remarks at the E-Business workshop at 
CERAWeek2000 in which your participation was appreciated.? It lays out a 
framework and identifies the key strategic challenges of e-business and 
energy, as well as our approach in the "E-Squared: Energy and E-Business" 
retainer service.? The "E-Squared" service is now up and running, and we hope 
that you will consider enrolling to receive our on-going research.

Our next major event, the E-Business Summit, a senior level gathering 
including strategy presentations and discussions, will take place on June 26 
(evening) through 28th at the Sonesta Hotel in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

This outstanding program includes presentations by Clayton Christensen (of 
"Innovator's Dilemma" fame); Dan Yergin, Joe Stanislaw and Julian West of 
CERA; Andy Lippman of MIT's Media Lab; Susan DeSanti of the FTC; and others.? 
Participation is limited.

For more details or to enroll in the Summit and/or the E-Squared retainer 
service, please visit http://www.cera.com/offerings/ret/e2/ .

Please feel free to contact me, or my colleague Tim Fitzgerald at

further considerations

Sincerely, 

James Rosenfield
