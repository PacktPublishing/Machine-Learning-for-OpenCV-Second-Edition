Title: A Colossal and Dangerous Failure
URL: http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=3D35&m=3D2185


Overview: WESTERN ENERGY=01*CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR STAYS THE COURSE
California governor Gray Davis provided his strongest public statements to=
=20
date regarding the state=01,s power crisis in his annual State of the State=
=20
Address on January 8, 2001. Echoing many of his previous positions on what =
he=20
perceives as a flawed and unfair California market structure, the governor=
=20
labeled the state=01,s electricity market system a colossal and dangerous=
=20
failure. Among other actions, he launched new initiatives valued at $1=20
billion to encourage conservation, provide financing and land to new=20
generators, grant authority to utilities to engage in a portfolio of=20
transactions to manage electricity costs, and increase regulatory scrutiny =
of=20
existing market suppliers. The governor also called for a greater role for=
=20
the state in overseeing and constructing new power plants.

The governor acknowledged that the actions proposed are only some of the=20
steps necessary to put California on the road to recovery. Details regardin=
g=20
sources of funding for the initiative are still forthcoming. Although he=20
stated that California=01,s investor-owned utilities must not be allowed to=
 go=20
bankrupt, no formal plan for ensuring their solvency was given. The financi=
al=20
community continues to lack the assurance it requires to continue to provid=
e=20
financial backing for Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California=20
Edison. At this time the state legislature remains the body most likely to=
=20
guarantee their solvency.

The governor again criticized the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for=
=20
what he believes has been its failure to manage and restrain properly the=
=20
wholesale market. Merchant plant generators were accused of gouging the=20
state, and it was suggested that these generators acted illegally in their=
=20
operations, jeopardizing the reliability of the power grid. New, more sever=
e=20
sanctions were promised for those caught withholding power or extracting wh=
at=20
investigators find as unreasonable profits.

A Los Angeles Times poll released the morning before the governor=01,s addr=
ess=20
indicated that the majority of Californians still do not believe there is a=
n=20
energy crisis. Although the 33 percent growth in the state=01,s economy ove=
r the=20
past ten years has nearly outstripped the state=01,s and surrounding region=
=01,s=20
supplies of power, the bulk of the governor=01,s statements continue to foc=
us on=20
the culpability of power producers, rather than the serious supply shortfal=
l.

Though the governor introduced steps to fund and facilitate the constructio=
n=20
of new generating plants, increased regulatory scrutiny and the threat of=
=20
sanctions will exacerbate the concern already expressed by plant developers=
=20
and the financial community that the investment climate in California is=20
excessively risky.
