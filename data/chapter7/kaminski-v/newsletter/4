Vince,

I see that you are flying around a lot this week, but I wanted to let you 
know how it's going with the newsletter.  I've scheduled Steve Bigelow as the 
"person of the week."  Regarding Technical Corner, I sent you a copy of 
Maureen's article for your review.  Bob Lee told me he has also sent you 
something.  I'd appreciate your guidance on which one to use.  I believe 
Maureen's is time-sensitive, so I'd vote for that one if you've had a chance 
to look it over.

I'm going to be out of town the rest of today and Thursday-Friday to attend 
my uncle's funeral in Illinois.  If you fly over Illinois, please wave! :-)

Have a safe trip(s),

Sam
