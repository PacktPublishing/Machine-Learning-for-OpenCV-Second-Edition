Jeff, 

I don't think this transaction makes sense. We should not keep increasing our 
exposure
in one area, given that we can deploy our capital in a more efficient way 
elsewhere,
without taking illiquid, long-term positions.

This is a draft of the dash we are putting together. Michael Tribolet works 
in my group and feel free to contact him if you have specific questions. I 
also spoke with Frevert re Lng and he informed me that if project Summer 
happpens, Lng goes with Summer, if not, it is transferred to you. What 
happens in the mean time is anyone's guess. Lets discuss . Rick

Here is the draft of the DASH.    While having a positive NPV, many of the 
trials run are negative due to defaults.
