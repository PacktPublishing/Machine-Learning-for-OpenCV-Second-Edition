Joe, Mike,

Please check with PR first if we want too talk to her
and run  it by Mark. I think it is in our interest to be 
quotes extensively in the press.

Vince

Subject: Report Research


I am writing a management report on weather risk management. The story
will discuss different weather risk management tools used by power
marketers in the energy industry. It also looks at weather prediction
and analysis services available to energy traders.

I am looking for a list and description of the weather risk management
products, and how each can benefit an energy trader. I would also like
to know what  traders' reactions to significant weather are. And where
can I find a list of popular weather instruments with descriptions?

I appreciate any help you can give me. I would like to set up a chat
with you this week if you have the time, or simply email me your input.
Thanks in advance!
