Sandeep,
?
We've?completed a review?this morning to  try to fill in missing pieces?of 
information on hourly load shapes, hydro  dispatch history, and transactions 
for India and have not come up with anything  yet. Would you know of any of 
the above information which would?assist us in our efforts?
?
Thanks,
?

Sandeep,
?
Below, I have summarized Henwood's work on the  India database to date. 
?
The "Inter_Regional Links.ppt" file shows the  topology and links between 
bubbles in the our model and  "Expand_India_Data_011000.xls" details the 
existing station information that  we have compiled to date.?Total resources 
closely match reported  resources as shown in "L&R_0110.xls". Reported India 
total in 1997 is  86,000 MW and that in the Henwood database is 84,000 MW 
through  1997.

We are currently working on the development of  hourly load shaping, seasonal 
hydro energy allocation, and the gathering of  transaction information. 
Sandeep, we will try to contact you tomorrow  (Thursday -- Australia?or 
Wednesday -- United States) to answer any  questions that you may have on 
this information.

Sincerely,
