Stinson and Vince,

Please see Wade's comments below.  It is critical that we start the exercise 
quickly, and as metioned, it should be structured so that DPC foot the bill.

Also, as mentioned, please have them desist from using the word viability 
with reference to Dabhol.

Regards,
Sandeep.

Thanks Sandeep. Engagement needs to be structured so that DPC will pay for 
this key study. Have them address the study to DPC and invoice DPC. 

Second, on the cover, the reference is to "...... and Dabhol Plant 
Viability." Please instruct them to immediately cease discussions about and 
use of term Dabhol viability. They can use the term they use later on, which 
is Dabhol Plant Operations.

Gentlemen,

I have attached a proposal for your consideration
Please review this and give me a call on my cell phone +61 412 234 366

next week
There may be some residual typing errors in the proposal, please forgive me
as I have no staff to review
