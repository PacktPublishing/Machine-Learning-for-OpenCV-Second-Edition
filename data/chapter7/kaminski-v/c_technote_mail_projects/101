Kevin,

 the memo looks good.  One suggestion I have is to emphasize what we can 
deliver by end of January since that was the initial deadline.  Although the 
memo indicates that a lot of work has been done, the reader might want to 
know what he can get in his hand in terms of models or quantitative results.  
You will of course describe everything in your presentation, but given that 
setting up presentations may take time, you should think about creating some 
template/model and send it with brief explanations.  For example, a template 
for TRS as it stands, and a template listing trigger events and how the 
results will be displayed.  You can then expand on this in your presentations.
