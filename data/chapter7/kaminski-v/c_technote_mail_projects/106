THE GOVERNMENT of Maharashtra wants New Delhi to convince the Power Trading=
=20
Corporation, a central utility, to buy power from Dabhol and sell it across=
=20
the country.It would be far simpler if Dabhol  and all independent power=20
producers  were allowed to sell power to whoever was willing to pay for=20
it.That, unfortunately, is not allowed by law, which forces private sector=
=20
generators to sell power only to state utilities, which in turn, are not=20
permitted to sell power across states on their own.=20

Most state electricity boards are bankrupt . MSEB reportedly owes central=
=20
utilities Rs 5,000 crore. They cannot bring themselves to charge many types=
=20
of users for the power consumed, nor can they prevent large-scale theft of=
=20
electricity. Few, including wealthy Maharashtra, have the will to reform=20
state electricity boards and privatise transmission and distribution. Given=
=20
this profile of buyers, private generators demand sovereign guarantees to=
=20
help them tide over default risks. But the guarantees merely insulate IPPs=
=20
against risk. They cannot make SEBs solvent. Yet, India needs power=20
desperately. Maharashtra, India=01,s richest state, experiences power short=
ages=20
of around 2,000 MW, about a sixth of its peak needs.=20

Over time, the hunger for power will only grow. India cannot afford to wait=
=20
for the painful politics of SEB reform to work themselves out. The governme=
nt=20
should bring in legislation that allows IPPs to sell power directly to payi=
ng=20
customers.This will free IPPs from the clutches of bankrupt monopsony buyer=
s.=20
The power trading legislation will have unexpectedly happy consequences for=
=20
the government too.Once IPPs are freed from their onerous obligations to se=
ll=20
power to single, mostly bankrupt buyers, their default risks will come down=
=20
substantially. New Delhi and state governments should then scrap the=20
guarantees that they gave IPPs in the past.=20
The combination of power trading, private investments in generation,=20
transmission and distribution, and gradual SEB reform  will create a=20
commercial, workable and competitive power market in India. Anything less=
=20
will be a recipe for disaster.=20

State not to give tax sops to DPC for buying naphtha from IOC, (Sanjay Jog)=
=20
 Thursday Jan 18 2001

The Maharshtra government's finance department, which is striving to reduce=
=20
fiscal deficit from Rs 9,484 crore to Rs 3,484 crore by the beginning of=20
April this year, has expressed its inability to provide a sales tax waiver =
to=20
the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) on the procurement of 1.2 million tonne of=
=20
naphtha from the state-run Indian Oil Corporation (IOC).=20

Mantralaya sources told The Financial Express on Wednesday that DPC would=
=20
have to pay 4 per cent sales tax. "The government, way back in 1995, has=20
modified the sales tax rate to 4 per cent to discourage the import of napht=
ha=20
from Gujarat by electrical companies operating in Maharashtra. The decision=
=20
was taken with a view to encouraging electrical companies to procure naphth=
a=20
at reduced rates within the state," government sources added. Sources said=
=20
that these companies had to pay nearly 15.3 per cent sales tax on naphtha=
=20
that was procured from Gujarat. However, following their representation, th=
e=20
government slashed the sales tax rate to 4 per cent.
=20
The state finance department's opinion, which would be presented before the=
=20
state cabinet shortly in order to take a final decision, deserves special=
=20
significance especially when the state energy department and the loss-makin=
g=20
Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) have wholeheartedly supported th=
e=20
DPC's cause and recommended the sales tax waiver. DPC, which was asked by t=
he=20
Union ministry of oil and petroleum to procure naphtha within the country i=
n=20
view of excess availability, in its presentation to the state government an=
d=20
to MSEB, had made it clear that it would be left with no alternative but to=
=20
pass on the additional burden on the MSEB which would be ultimately passed =
on=20
to its consumers. DPC had also told the state government that it had not pa=
id=20
sales tax on the procurement of naphtha from Glencore in the calender year=
=20
2000.=20

Sources from the state energy department and MSEB have stressed on the need=
=20
for such a waiver while expressing their inability to bear additional burde=
n.=20
They have suggested that the state should reciprocate by offering a sales t=
ax=20
exemption to DPC because the IOC, at the behest of the Centre, has tried to=
=20
match the international landing price of naphtha during the recently signed=
=20
memorandum of agreement with DPC. "If the state finance department sticks t=
o=20
its views, it may hurt the state as a whole," sources from the state energy=
=20
department and MSEB said.DPC will procure naphtha at Rs 11,050 per ton from=
=20
IOC during the calender year 2001 as compared to the Rs 10,050 per tonne=20
price quoted by Glencore. The naphtha price comprises $175 per tonne free o=
n=20
board (FOB), 21.8 per cent of customs duty, 5.4 per cent of sales tax and=
=20
$18.87 of premium.
=20
DPC senior vice president Mukesh Tyagi reiterated that the company has=20
already made an appeal to the state government for the sales tax waiver on=
=20
naphtha in the larger interest of the consumers. "Sales tax is a pass throu=
gh=20
and MSEB, which will have to bear the additional burden, will pass it on th=
e=20
consumers," he added.

Centre yet to receive proposal on Enron
Thursday Jan 18 2001

CENTRE on Wednesday said that it had not recevied any proposal from=20
Maharashtra government seeking help to solve the tangle with the Enron=20

the reports that Maharashtra government was sending a proposal that centre=

proposal." "We are carefully watching the situation and will await a concre=

proposal before intervening in this matter," Parbhu said on the sidelines o=

=20
was any possibility of the government asking the Power Trading Corporation =
to=20
buy power from the Dhabol Power Corporation, Prabhu replied "what will the=

PTC do with the power?"=20

Prabhu had earlier asked the state government to study the matter before=20
