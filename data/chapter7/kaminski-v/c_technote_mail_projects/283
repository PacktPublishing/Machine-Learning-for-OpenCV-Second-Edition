Subject: Vince Does your group have a Monthly or a Quarterly price history in 
nominal terms
for a US onshore Louisiana natural gas price (or a Texas wellhead price ) and 
a UK landed beach price for the past 15 years? I am gathering historical data 
for Jim O Hara for our Colombia pipeline in South America and these are among 
the series of data they are seeking. They would like the data
from a published source in an electronic file if possible.. Their timetable 
is by COB Weds this week. Thank you for your help. Margaret
