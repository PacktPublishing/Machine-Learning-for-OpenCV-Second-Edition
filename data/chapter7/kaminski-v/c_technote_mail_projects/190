Stinson,

I think the gamma will flow into V@R.

Alex,

Paulo and I have continued to look at the model and have come up with a 
couple of additional changes.

1.   The cash flow calculations need to include the overlying option strike 
payment.   Also, Paulo is trying to clarify if the cashflows should be 
discounted to the valuation date or reported as notional future values.
2.  I would suggest trying changing the option valuation from a binomial tree 
approach to a one-dimensional integration, perhaps using a quadrature 
method.  This may allow us to minimize the size of the delta discontinuities.
3.  Edith is supposed to check and see if the theoretical gamma is used for 
anything.   If it is, we will probably need to revisit the gamma calculation 
since we are not currently including any cross terms for gamma.

Thanks,

Stinson
