Stinson,

I am trying to contact our data base experts at the moment to clarify some
issues with the region and may need another day to get something more
concrete in front of you.

What I would like to know is the extent of your company knowledge re the
following

Generation units' nameplate capacity, fuel type, efficiency, O&M costs, fuel
costs
Location of generation units
details of HV interconnectors between regions which have individual load
forecasts (capacity in MW, losses)
Details of Hydro/pump storage location, capacity and Historical outputs

many thanks

Robert
