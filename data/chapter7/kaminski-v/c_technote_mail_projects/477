Michael.

Thanks a lot for a very quick response. It looks fine.

Please, forward it to Margaret Carson. Please, explain the data source. She
may expect NYMEX as the data source for natgas and WTI.

Vince, here's the numbers and two charts. the charts represent the same 
information but have different styles. one has all of the prices on the same 
scale, and the other has crude and resid on one scale and natural gas on 
another.
