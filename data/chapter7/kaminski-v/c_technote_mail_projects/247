Hey guys,
 We're talking to a contractor(s) that can build us a weather station 
(hopefully very quickly) for placement in Sacramento, California.  For a 
variety of legal, contractor, and operational reasons, I need to confirm some 
of the following requirements as soon as possible so we can proceed:

a)  You need rainfall, snowfall, and temperature measurement from one, 
high-accuracy commercially available weather station.
b)  You need a daily feed of this data to Enron's weather desk:  Does this 
mean one data dump at a set time per day?  Alternatively, will you need to 
check the data real-time, perhaps at varying and multiple times during the 
day? 
c)  We will be installing this station near Sacramento, California:  We will 
need to know exactly what areas in/near Sacramento are suitable for the site 
of the weather station.  (What again was the name of the town that you 
mentioned Mark?)  In the interest of time, I recommend that your weather 
expert accompany our landman to select the site, which will allow our landman 
to more quickly lease and install the station.
d)  You desire to have some independent security measures to deter or detect 
tampering. I suggest given the very short time fuse, that we first install 
the station and then develop security measures.
e)  We will feed the data directly to the Enron weather desk.  Will any other 
parties require real-time access to this data?

Please forward responses directly to:  Chris Clark/NA/ENRON and myself. 
Thanks,  Scott
