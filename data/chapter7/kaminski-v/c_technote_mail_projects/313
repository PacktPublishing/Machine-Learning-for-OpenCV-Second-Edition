Vince-

I have discovered the two sources of discrepancy in the "transaction dollars" 
on EOL, between my numbers and those of EOL. First, EOL records all index 
trades with the Henry Hub price (since the index price isn't, inadvertently, 
recorded with the trade, as I told you), whereas I went back and appended the 
contemporaneous index price to the trades. Second, EOL ignores all Basis 
trades in reporting transaction dollars, whereas I append a rough size to 
them of the "price" as the basis, times the quantity.

I'm sorry I wasn't ready in time with my numbers; I took the task of accuracy 
very seriously.

Clayton
