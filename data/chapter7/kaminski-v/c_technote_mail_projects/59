Hi Vasant,

     As per our lunch conversation on yesterday, I mentioned that a friend of 
mine is a partner at McKinsey and he specializes in Agriculture.

     Attached is an email from him regarding meeting you and others here at 
Enron.

     How do you wish to proceed?

Thanks,
Iris

   Hi again,


        I had lunch today with some of the guys in my group who work on
   agriculture-related deals and on weather derivatives.

        I mentioned to them about Bernard's working at McKinsey and
   specializing in the agriculture area.

        We thought it might be worthwhile if we all had a chat and/or met
   to discuss possible collaborative efforts.

        Will you please forward this email on to Bernard to see if this
   might be of interest to him?


   Thanks,
   Iris
