Michelle,
The project is progressing. Helen has done a great job,  finding various flaws
in the initial design (Ken's design) of the Access table, and has been going 
back
and forth with Ken to modify the table. Since Helen can't devote full time to 
this project,
Chris has hired a contractor, Cecil Stradford, to do the coding. I have 
spoken with
Cecil just now and he says no coding has been done yet. I am trying to 
arrange 
a meeting today with Cecil, Helen, Christin (the one who's overseeing coding 
process in Cecil's company) and myself.  Will report back to you on what
is discussed in the meeting. 

Best,
Alex
