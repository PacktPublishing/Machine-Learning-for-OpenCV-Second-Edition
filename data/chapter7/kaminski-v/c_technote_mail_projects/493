Hi Mark, I have not met you yet but heard a lot of good things about you.  =
I=20
would like to discuss with you and possibly with John Bloomer and Richard=
=20
Reichardt about the EBS Research's role in supporting the Storage market=20
development from the origination and trading perspective.  There are severa=
l=20
people in various groups that are talking about storage but here is what's =
my=20
take on our involvement--please correct me or suggest otherwise. =20

Shalesh Ganjoo is our lead analyst on this effort.  In addition to his effo=
rt=20
with your group, he is presently supporting Jean Mrha with pricing and=20
standardization for a traded storage maret--Stinson Gibner is directly=20
supervising him in this effort.

Shalesh came to us through referal from David Cox--David discovered him at=
=20
one of his speaking engagements.  Shalesh had talked to David about traded=
=20
storage market development some time last October and David refered Shalesh=
=20
to Enron Research group. We hired Shalesh for general analyst position and=
=20
now he is pulled into all aspect of this storage effort.  Currently, he is=
=20
our point person (with Stinson or I supervising his effort) who is supporti=
ng=20
Jean Mrha and you on the subject.  Kara Knop has aproached Shalesh with=20
request for some support and Shalesh and she are sorting out each other=01,=
s=20
role in this regard.  As per my discussion today with David, we need to=20
coordinate this storage effort from the perspective of modeling market=20
assessment etc. For this I suggest Shalesh and his effort so that all parti=
es=20
involved can benefit from collective effort within one central source.  Bas=
ed=20
on David's and my assessment of Shalesh's capabilities, I would like to=20
suggest that the commercial heads use Shalesh for his creative thinking,=20
understanding of the market and analytical capabilities and not just for da=
ta=20
gathering and simple research effort. We can add other staff as we see the=
=20
need and as you request them.=20

Please respond this e-mail with your comments if this sounds like aplan, so=
=20
that we can support this effort efficiently and in a scalable manner.

Kind Regards,

Ravi.
