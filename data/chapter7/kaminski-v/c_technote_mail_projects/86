FYI.  This could be quite important for us.  Through forming a tradinf co. we 
could be brokering deals on behalf of MSEB, without letting them off the hook.

In this manner we could be doing short term deals and increasing despatch 
from Dabhol or other MSEB marginal units.  Any money flowing from these sales 
should go into an escrow account that goes directly towards payment of DPC 
bills.

In this manner we would be increasing the payment ability of MSEB.

Regards,
Sandeep.

Wade: The Group of Ministers on Foreign Investment had decided to recommend  
foreign equity participation upto 100% for trading in power sector, subject 
to prevailing laws. However, they left the final decision to the Union 
Cabinet. It is understood that a note supporting the recommendation of GoM is 
being put up for consideration of Union Cabinet. Since Power Minister is 
willing to support the proposal and Industry Minister is already OK with such 
proposals, I don't anticipate any problem at the Cabinet level. Let us wait 
and watch the developments.
