Vince,

Before I contact the London staff about next Wednesday's meeting, I was 
wondering if we could move it up a little bit.  The reason is that by 2pm in 
Houston it is 8pm in London and I thought it might be difficult to round up 
the crew in London at that time.  Please let me know if we have plans to 
change the time.

Thanks,

Eric
