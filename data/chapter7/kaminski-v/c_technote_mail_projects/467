Vince,

I'll send you the DASH that was done previously for the used LNG tanker, the 
Mystic Lady (now renamed as the Hoegh Galleon).  The analysis used in this 
transaction was not detailed due the short time-frame we had to analyze this 
transaction as well as to Enron's right to terminate this charter for 
convenience.

We are presently working on the analysis for a second, new-build LNG tanker.  
When this analysis has progressed far enough that we have a draft DASH, I 
will forward it to you (this may be later this week).

Regards,

Dave
