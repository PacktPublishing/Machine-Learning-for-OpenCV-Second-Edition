Vince,

I was wondering if you or someone in your group has had a chance to overview 
the LNG shipping model that I sent you.  Merritt Thomas is sending me more 
data to add the to model on all of the other ports and nautical miles.  I 
would like to to have your input on the functionality of this file before we 
go farther.

Please call with any questions or comments.

Thanks,

Eric

Eric,

I think we can skip the meeting and discuss any issues between us.
The meeting was convened at the request of Doug Arnell, but Jeff
Shankman thinks that there is no need for formal meetings: we can
ask them for the information directly on as needed basis.
