Mike,

Please, draft a message to JS, DD and JL outlining the AGA
benefits and costs. This will be their decision.

I actually called Stan Horton's office yesterday to find out if they knew 
anything about the AGA membership, and Cindy Stark who works with Stan 
informed me that Stan cancelled our associate membership with AGA effective 
January, 2000.  I called Jay Copan with AGA back and left him a voicemail 
with the information.  I asked him to call me if he had any questions and I 
have not heard back from him.  I'll considered it closed unless I hear back 
from him.

I believe that Stan Horton's office handled the dues for AGA.

Jay Copan with American Gas Assn. called.  Julie Caboose suggested that he 
talk with you about Enron's AGA dues.  (He spoke to Rick Shapiro who said 
that he has no knowledge of the dues situation).  Please call at 202-824-7020.
