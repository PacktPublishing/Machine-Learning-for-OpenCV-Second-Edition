I am sorry I couldnt connect with you last week.  How would your Tuesday
morning first thing, say 800 or 830 am be to get together to discuss the
demo proposal and other issues?  I can come by your office very conveniently
then.  Give me an email shout if you could squeeze it in on Monday.  I look
forward to speaking with you.

Dale
