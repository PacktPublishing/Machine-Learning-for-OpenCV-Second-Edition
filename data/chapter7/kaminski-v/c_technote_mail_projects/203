Hi all,
The scheduled Wednesday (Nov. 8) presentation has to be cancelled.  Even 
though in his earlier message
Mike said Wednesday is ok, now they will have problem sending people. 

I will try to reschedule the presentation to a later date.

Best,
Alex

Alex, I'm glad that we had a chance to talk today about a WeatherDelta
overview.  The 8th is not really going to work well for us, due to recent
reschedulings.  Several members of the WeatherDelta team will be in or near
Houston on the 14th and 15th of November (I know that you said that week was
tight), and could arrange to be in the several weeks following those dates.


I have attached our standard non-disclosure agreement, which we will need to
execute prior to the product demonstration.  I have also attached a reprint
of a recent article, describing WeatherDelta's approach and functionality.
As soon as a meeting can be scheduled, a list of attendees would be very
helpful to us in preparing the appropriate materials.

Thank you again,

Michael Denton
