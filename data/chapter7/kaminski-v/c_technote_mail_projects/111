Subject: I will miss the Tuesday Staff Meeting

Vince,

I will not be able to attend the meeting. Here are some updates:

1) I left a message to George Posey, I will follow up tomorrow (Tuesday),
2) I will follow up on the Credit Reserve issue ASAP, I will find out what the
present state of the models are and come up with modification requirements
to accomodate asset related projects.
3) This week I will need to spend much of my time in meeting with the 
breakthrough
folks. They are at a stage where
our contribution is being defined and specifies ( curves, components, etc.). 
If you
would like to contact me urgently, please leave a phone message instead of 
e-mail--
I will be checking my phone messages more frequently.
4) We have a VAR meeting with RAC on EAM issues Wednesday at 1pm.
5) Other issues are covered in my project list.

Regards,
Osman
