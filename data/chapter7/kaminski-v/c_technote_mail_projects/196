Stinson,

I add the total P/L due to contract rollover.  When the number of trades is 
large
and the spread is not too small, the model prints a lot of money, dominated by
those trade earning the half of BO spread. 

I also wrote an explaination about the model on the front page. I think we 
are 
ready to deliever the model V.1.
