Simon,

Please forward a copy of my Ken Rice presentation to Vince Kaminski.  Send 
him the version with the white background.

Vince:

Thanks again for meeting with me today and I am pleased that you are 
interested in discussing this opportunity in more detail.

Feel free to contact me should you have any questions.  As discussed, the 
Enron Media / Advertising idea is being developed under EBS, but should 
develop into its own business unit.  

Enron Media / Advertising:
- Advertising Risk Book
- Physical Trades, supported by excess inventory from Cable Networks, Radio, 
Network TV, etc.
- Media Buying Service 
- Alliances with Advertising Agencies to sell Enron's "eyeballs" from our 
customer / server - ISP relationships i.e., US West
- Agencies could endorse EBS to their customers (Ford GM, Procter & Gamble, 
etc.) and become an Extended Enterprise for EBS and our EIN applications  
- Enron's Capital, to fund Content Development for the networks and 
Hollywood, which in turn would provide content for our pipes with licensing 
and syndication rights.
- An Enron On Line B to B opportunity (You may want to review the following 
sites: DoubleClick.com, Agency.com, AdAuction.com)

Mark and Kal:

Vince and I are meeting on Tuesday, March 28th @ 3:00 PM to further discuss 
the development of the Enron Media /Advertising concept .  Can you join us to 
provide a Customer and Agency perspective? 

Regards,
Michael P. Horning
