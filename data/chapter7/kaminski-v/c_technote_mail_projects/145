George,

We shall be able to accommodate one or two extra people
in the first round.

We shall be glad to repeat the seminars starting soon for a 
bigger group. We would like to learn form experience how to run
it.

By the way, we had an option training for EES (roughly 150 people,
over a few weeks). I can give you the materials and
we can repeat it if you think it's useful.

Vince

Vince - I had heard about this derivatives class from Clayton
and I am inquiring about the possibility of someone outside 
of the Research Group being able to attend.  If so, I would
like the opportunity.  Let me know if it is possible.

Thanks,
George
