Vince,

I'd like to get someone to sit with one of team for a couple of days.... To 
help with reviewing code.

There seems to be two view of how this is currently working.

Your team seems to think Winston group is not being co-operative enough.

Winston's team seems to think they are co-operating...

I'd like to resolve this.

If my suggestion above doesn't work (putting some in your team for a couple 
of days) , I would like for us to sit down with Winston, Nilay and Tanya and 
try to work out what's happening.



Regards

Steve
