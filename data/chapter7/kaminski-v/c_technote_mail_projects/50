Hi Amitava,

     As we discussed this morning, I have created the attached spreadsheet 
for our "to dos" for the the credit guys.

     Please take a look at it to make sure it is okay, make any changes, etc.

     In the mean time I will work on the data vendor research, order Eviews, 
etc......


Thanks,
Iris
