Eric:

Mr. Nur Azmin Abu Bakar of Petronas, along with 4 of
his Corporate Risk Management team will visit Enron on
Thursday, February 8th.  Jeff Shankman and Vince Kaminski
would like to invite you to attend all or some of the
presentations.

A tentative agenda has the Petronas team meeting with
Jeff and John Nowlan at 10:00AM and then a presentation
by David Port and the RAC group, followed by Vince 
Kaminski and the Research group.  Vince will take the
team to lunch and you are invited.

Please let me know if you plan to attend all or part of
the presentations and if you would like to go to lunch.

Thanks Eric.
