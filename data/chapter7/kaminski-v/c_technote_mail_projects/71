Michelle,
The coding is progressing nicely. Cecil and David have the first part of the 
code
almost done (there are 3 parts of code), and they expect to have the first 
two parts
completed by next Tuesday or Wednesday.  If Ken's needed, that will be in the
testing of the third part of code,  which should be sometime next week or 
later. 
I will inform you of the status change as soon as possible.

Best,
Alex
