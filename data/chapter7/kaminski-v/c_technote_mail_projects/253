Subject: Request for natural gas technical analysis

Hello Mike,

I work in Rodney Malcolm's Commercial Transaction Group, focusing on 
developing energy management relationships with large volume industrial 
energy consumers.  Due to the volatility and high price levels of the natural 
gas contract, these consumers of natural gas are extremely concerned about 
this exposure, and they are asking for our assistance in helping them manage 
this exposure. One of the tools that these customers are requesting is 
technical analysis of the natural gas contract so as to determine entry 
points for their hedges.

To the extent you could assist us with this analysis, we can  proactively 
meet these customer requests and increase our deal flow.

Please advise as to the availability of your assistance.  

Thank you, Tim
