Vince,

A quick project update.

1.   Sandeep and I spoke with  Robert Schenck in Adelaide.   He will email a 
Henwood proposal to us.  They already figured that we must be interested in 
modelling Dabhol.
2.  The WTI EOL trading simulation had an error.   We were counting a 
mid-offer spread profit on each trade, but we actually would make the spread 
on each round-trip transaction (one trade to open, one trade to close).    I 
modified the calculation and sent the new numbers to Greg Whalley (he is the 
one who caught the mistake, so there goes my bonus for the year.) and John 
Lavorato.   I should probably re-run the earning volatility numbers, and 
update Ted Murphy as well.
