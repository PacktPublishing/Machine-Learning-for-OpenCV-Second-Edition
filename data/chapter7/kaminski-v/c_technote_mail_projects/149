Subject: CA for Henwood

Bruce,

Evidently your assistant was unsuccessul in finding the CA's used in either 
the of the previous Henwood projects for Japan and Korea.

We are working on a project to model the economic viability of Dabhol under 
economic dispatch and are faced with a very tight deadline in February.   Can 
you help us put together a confidentiality agreement for Henwood Energy 
Services, Inc. who will be performing the model calculations?

Any help would be appreciated.

Regards,

Stinson Gibner
