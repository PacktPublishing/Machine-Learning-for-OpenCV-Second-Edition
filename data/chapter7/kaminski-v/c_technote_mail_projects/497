Subject: curves for South America

Vince and Grant,

I have been made responsible for all gas and power curves in South America 
(plus books development, reporting, .......).  I have somewhat started but, 
since I am new on the job, I'd love to receive advice, guidance (and at some 
stage help) from you.  Would you be available for a meeting next week, 
preferably Thursday or Friday?   I'm planning to be in Houston these days.
