Vince & Stinson,

For your information,  Professor Duffie assigned Taiichi, his Ph.D. student 
to work on the audit back in May.
I will contact with him about the progress.

Dear Zimin,

 It was nice talking to you on the phone today
and thank you for the tip. I manually created "c:\Temp"
and that was it. The spreadsheet works now. With Pentium
200Mhz and 80M memory, it runs within 5 minutes.

Very best regards,
