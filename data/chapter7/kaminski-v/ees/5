Hello Vince:

My name is Fati Liamidi.  I work as an Associate in the URM group in EES. 
I have come up with an value proposition which I think could make sense for
my group and wanted to run it by one of your colleagues to see if they could 
help me out in terms of pricing. 
Would you mind directing me toward somebody in your group who would be 
willing to talk to me?  The idea involves options. 

Thanks you very much in advance.
