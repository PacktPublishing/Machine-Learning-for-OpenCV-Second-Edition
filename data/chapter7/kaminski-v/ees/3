Consistent with the floor talks of a couple weeks ago, we are following up=
=20
with an e-mail describing the latest changes in our risk and back-office=20
functions that are now complete.  EES=01,s Risk Management and the vast maj=
ority=20
of EES=01,s Risk Controls and Operations Group will become a new group in E=
nron=20
Wholesale Services. This group=01,s sole function will be to provide pricin=
g,=20
structuring, commodity risk management, logistics and back-office services=
=20
for EES.  Both Don Black and Wanda Curry will report to the EWS Office of t=
he=20
Chairman.=20

This change was driven by the explosive growth of EES and the resulting nee=
d=20
to tap the systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale groups in=
=20
order to continue to grow and take advantage of current market=20
opportunities.  This change will allow us to more quickly capture the=20
benefits of scale, process, and technology in risk, logistics and back-offi=
ce=20
functions from the larger Enron capability.  As discussed at the All Employ=
ee=20
Meeting in March, these are important objectives, and this change allows us=
=20
to reach those goals more quickly.=20

Specifically, the following groups within the former EES Risk Management=20
Group, will become a part of this new group reporting to Don Black:

- the gas, power and tariff desks,
- the options desk,
- the site profiles and consumption desks, and
- the matrix products/secondary products desks.

The DSM Group and IAM, along with its execution capability, will remain in=
=20
EES and report to the EES Office of the Chairman. We are pleased to announc=
e=20
that Ozzie Pagan has agreed to lead this function.  Ozzie is an established=
=20
commercial dealmaker in ENA.  He has experience in power trading, originati=
on=20
and plant development. In addition, the Services Group, which will provide=
=20
billing, information and other retail services, led by Evan Hughes, will=20
remain in EES and report to the EES OOC.  All support functions, within the=
=20
former EES Risk Controls and Operations Group, that currently support the D=
SM=20
and the Services Groups, will remain in EES.  The remaining parts of the Ri=
sk=20
Controls and Operations Group will become part of EWS reporting to Wanda=20
Curry.  As part of this change, we are pleased to add Evan Hughes and Ozzie=
=20
Pagan to the EES Operating Committee.

In addition, the Structuring Group, led by Sean Holmes, will be re-named De=
al=20
Management.  The vision for this group remains the same as that discussed a=
t=20
the All Employee Meeting; however, it will also facilitate and ensure=20
productive transaction interaction between EES and EWS.

We have asked, Marty Sunde, as part of his Vice Chairman role, to resource=
=20
and lead a formal Restructuring Group to enhance or protect value in severa=
l=20
key transactions in our portfolio primarily in  California.=20


The newly created IT function, led by Anthony Dayao, will continue to repor=
t=20
into the EES OOC but will support both EES and EWS IT requirements.

Other than these changes, the organizational structure, vision and objectiv=
es=20
detailed out for EES at the All-Employee Meeting in March remain.  We need =
to=20
continue to understand and drive deeper into our markets, manage our client=
=20
relationships, mine our portfolio, build new products and execute on our=20
opportunities.

Thanks for all your hard work.  With your help we will become the Worlds=20
Leading Energy Retailer and Enron=01,s Leading Division.  If you have any=
=20
questions please do not hesitate to ask=20
