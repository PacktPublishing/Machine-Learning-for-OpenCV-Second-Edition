Chris,

We don't have yet any report on Broadband that might help you, developed 
internally
by my group. We are working on a tutorial and we shall send you a copy when
it's ready.

The person who can give you an introduction  to this market is Ravi 
Thuraisingham.


Vince

Vince:

 I am working now in EES as the Chase National Account manager and  am 
developing new products to sell Chase. One of the products  I am working on 
integrates the provision of broad band with  a  package of   computer 
hardware and software for a company's employees. 
I can explain more if you are interested.

I understand you put together a  report on Broadband which has helped educate 
people as to the technology and economics. Can I get a copy?.

Also do you have any analyses on Chase that might help me  detect other 
opportunities?

Is there anyone on your staff with whom I should talk?

Thanks

Chris
