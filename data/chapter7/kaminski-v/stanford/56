Vince,

I will call Paul Racicot tomorrow.  Can you try and do the same?

Thanks,

Stinson

Hi Stinson,

I am under pressure from the Department to wrap up Giuseppe's RAship,
and I am probing to see how things are going on this matter on your
side. I'm deep in the red in terms of the deadline - way beyond it!
Would it be possible to wrap this up this week?

Many Thanks,

Nick
