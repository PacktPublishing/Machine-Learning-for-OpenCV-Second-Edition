Vince,

I have managed to change my ticket and we can meet for dinner on Sunday 
10/15/00.
Shall we say at 7pm?

>>>>Giuseppe: Can you please join us for dinner on Sunday 10/15. We'd like to 
briefly
discuss the project too. Could I please ask you to make reservations for 3 at
Il Fornaio or some other nice place in Palo Alto? Preferably a quiet place 
where
we can talk.<<<<

Thanks,

Nick
