Stinson,

I'm arriving at the George Bush airport in Houston next Thursday at 5:15pm.
I could then take a taxi to the hotel or the restaurant. How long would it
take me to get there? Is there a "rush hour" problem at that time?

I'm flying out of Houston on Friday at 6:45pm. Is there a rush hour problem
on the freeways at that time? What time should I leave from Enron to be at the
airport at 6pm?

I hope I'll have opportunities to give talks at Enron in subsequent visits
along the research path. In this first visit I was hoping to understand better
the research goals of Enron and brainstorm with people about what are the
top challenges and opportunities for our research collaboration. Identifying
the best research problems in terms of
1) highest innovation potential and
2) highest projected impact
would be at the top of my list. It might be unprofessional on my side to
talk to an audience that I don't have any prior information about and is
very diverse anyway; it could actually be "dangerous." I would feel MUCH more
comfortable to do that in my second visit, after I have understood the 
environment
better and I have some results to talk about. I would like to be in a
position to "impress" people when I give my first talk at Enron. (Besides,
I will have to prepare good slides for such a talk and I am totally swamped
all next week.)

I'm swamped, but I'll try to put something together.

I look forward to seeing you next week.

Nick
