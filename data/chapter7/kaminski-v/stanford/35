Yes, I would be definitely interested. Count me and Osman also to 
participate. I will forward your email to others in EES who might be 
interested also.

John and Krishna,

I am sending you an outline of a conference at Stanford on topics related to 
demand-side pricing and management in the power markets.

Please, let me know if you are personally interested and who else
in your respective  organizations would like to attend.

Vince
