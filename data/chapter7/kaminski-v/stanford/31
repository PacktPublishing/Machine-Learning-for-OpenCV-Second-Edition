Hill,

Yes, I think it can be done. I am in London

Vince,

Sounds like there are several Enron people very interested in our
seminar.  Many thanks for passing the idea around.

Do you think that these groups might provide some sponsorship?  I didn't
know whether you have already asked them and they are thinking about it or
whether I need to approach them directly.  I would appreciate any
suggestions you have.

Regards,
Hill
