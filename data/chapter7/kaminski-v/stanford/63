Paul,

Thanks for putting in place the funding for our Stanford relationship with 
Nick Bambos.

Below is a draft letter which should accompany the funds sent to Stanford.   
By designating the funds as a gift to this specific research area, all the 
funds can be used to support bandwidth and networking research without any 
overhead charge from the university.    If you need any clarification or 
assistance, please contact Vince, me,  or Nick Bambos directly.   Nick's 
email is bambos@stanford.edu.
