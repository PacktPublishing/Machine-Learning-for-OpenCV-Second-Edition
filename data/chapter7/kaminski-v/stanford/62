Nick,

I spoke with Paul Racicot, head of trading for  EBS, North America this 
morning.   He said that he is happy to send the $100,000 for your program 
from his budget.   I have forwarded to him the draft letter to accompany the 
funds and will try to follow up to make sure that the money is sent promptly.
