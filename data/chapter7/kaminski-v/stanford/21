Vince:

Per Susan's email below, do you want to go to the luncheon for John
Hennessey?  She doesn't say where the lunch is going to be, did you
get an invite?

The only thing you have that day is 9:00 AM Larry Thorne and the
Energy Derivatives Class at 11:30.

Let me know.

Thanks!

Shirley

Hi Shirley,

thanks for corresponding with Carol during my absence, and confirming our
meeting with Vince Kaminski at 1:30 on May 4th.  I have a question about
the logistics.  I believe Dr. Kaminski has received an invitation to an
event in Houston: new Stanford president John Hennessy is visiting a number
of cities on a "welcome tour," and it just so happens he is hosting a
luncheon in Houston on May 4th.  If Dr. Kaminski wants to attend the
Hennessy Welcome Tour luncheon, Donna Lawrence and I could meet with him at
1:30 somewhere in the hotel.  If he's not attending the presidential event,
please let me know where you are located, and we'll plan travel time
accordingly.

Regards,
Susan
