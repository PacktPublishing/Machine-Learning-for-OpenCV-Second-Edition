Hi Vince,

Unfortunately, I have not heard from him.  He also forwarded his resume to Mauricio Mora, who asked if we could interview him.  When I asked Celeste about it back then she decided against it.  If you need some help tracking him down, let me know.  

Thanks,
Althea

Althea,

I was trying to get in touch with this guy.
Did he contact you by any chance?  He missed
the interviews on the campus.

Vince

Dear Vincent,

As I told you on the phone on Friday, I am very interested in a summer
internship at Enron. I would like to point out that I want to pursue a
career in trading, and I am especially interested in derivatives. Given that
Enron is a pioneer in the market making of energy, broadband and weather
derivatives, I find it a company I would be most interested in working for.

I believe that you will find my background of interest to your firm, and I
hope to be interviewed by yourself and other colleagues of yours. I have
final exams from March 19-22, but would be most willing to travel to Houston
for interviews any time from Friday March 23rd onwards. I hope to hear from
you soon.

Best regards,

Juan Seade
