II. Meeting Logistics

Enron will hold Eastern Hemisphere Associate and Analyst PRC meetings on Ju=
ly=20
17th in London. The PRC for the Eastern Hemisphere will include Europe, Ind=
ia=20
and Asia and will be chaired by John Sherriff.=20

The Western Hemisphere Associate and Analyst PRC meetings will be held on=
=20
July 19th in Houston.  The PRC for the Western Hemisphere will include Sout=
h=20
America, Calgary, Portland, Houston and Australia (Houston administers it)=
=20
and will be chaired by Joe Sutton.  The Analyst PRC will be conducted from=
=20
8:00 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., and the Associate PRC will be conducted from 1:30=
=20
p.m. to 6:30 p.m. =20

III. Process

Each PRC representative has been randomly assigned 15 to 17 Associates or=
=20
Analysts that they will represent in the PRC meeting.  Please note the PRC=
=20
rep is not representing only those individuals who may work in his or her=
=20
specific OpCo but individuals that work throughout the organization.  The P=
RC=20
rep will continue to represent the assigned Associates or Analysts during=
=20
their entire tenure with the Program.
The PRC reps are expected to contact the PRC supervisor and gather=20
performance information (including pre-ratings if available).
The Program will prepare a binder for each PRC rep that includes consolidat=
ed=20
feedback from the PEP system for their assigned Associates or Analysts and=
=20
will provide this to the PRC Representatives on July 7th.
Associates and Analysts will be pre-rated by their Business Unit supervisor=
=20
using the six performance ratings (Superior - Issues) and the Management=20
Professional feedback form as detailed in the PEP system.  The pre-ratings=
=20
must be loaded into PEP by July 6th. =20
The Associate and Analyst ratings will be cross-calibrated by tenure at the=
=20
meeting as follows:
Associates:
Level 1: 0 to 6 months
Level 2: 7 to 12 months
Levels 3 & 4 will be reviewed together: 13 months+.
Analysts:
Level 1: 0 to 6 months
Level 2: 7 to 12 months
Level 3: 13 to 24 months
Level 4 and 5 will be reviewed together: 25 months+
The rating determined in the global cross calibration meeting is final, and=
=20
cannot be changed once the meeting has ended.
Following the global Associate and Analyst PRC, the Associates=01, and the=
=20
Analysts=01, supervisors will obtain the final rating from the PRC=20
representative.  The supervisors must ensure that an evaluation session is=
=20
conducted and the final rating is communicated to each Associate and Analys=
t=20
by September 15th. The completed form must be signed by the Associate or=20
Analyst and returned to Terry Bosien in Human Resources by 9/18/00.

IV. Promotions
All promotions must be recommended in the PRC.
Associates are eligible for promotion to manager at their 18 and 24 month=
=20
anniversary.
Timing.  Anniversaries that occur from April 1st through September 30th=20
should be recommended in the July PRC and those that occur from October 1st=
=20
through March 31st should be recommended in the December PRC.   If the=20
promotion is granted it would become effective on the 1st of the month=20
following the PRC, or on the Associate=01,s anniversary date, whichever is =
later.
Associates promoted after March 31st for the July PRC and after September=
=20
30th for the December PRC will be evaluated as Associates for PRC purposes,=
=20
not as a Manager  (i.e. An Associate was promoted to Manager effective Apri=
l=20
1st.  In the July PRC the individual should be evaluated as an Associate no=
t=20
as a manager).
2nd year Analysts are to be recommended for promotion to 3rd year Analysts=
=20
after completing the 2nd year, utilizing the same timing criteria outlined=
=20
above (i.e., an Analyst who completes the 2nd year on September 30th should=
=20
be recommended for promotion to 3rd year Analyst in the July PRC).
3rd year Analysts may be recommended for promotion to Associate after=20
completing the 3rd year, utilizing the same timing criteria outlined above=
=20
(i.e., an Analyst who completes the 3rd year on September 30th should be=20
recommended for promotion to Associate in the July PRC).
