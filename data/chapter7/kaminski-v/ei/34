Vince,

I'm following up on our conversation late last week and I'm interested to see 
what your group can advise, per Doug Leach's recommendation.  As you can see 
he is raising a major red flag in regards to our non-binding offer to Cairn.  
Since, it was late the other night I didn't touch base with Sandeep Kohli, 
but Bobby and I are probably the most knowledgeable in regards to the Indian 
gas market.  Please let me know what information you may need from us to 
provide some guidance.

Regards,
Doug

There is no harm in seeing what Kaminski's group will advise.   Do you have 
any problem in contacting them ?

I strongly disagree with the pricing and structure of your non-binding offer 
to Cairn. This reminds me of the debacle in Brazil. You should have contacted 
Vince Kaminski's research group as we talked about before an offer was made. 
This is a bad deal.

Doug & Marc,

FYI, please let me know if you think we're totally off base.  I appreciate 
your help.

Regards,
Doug

Bobby,

After meeting with Cairn today in Delhi, my perception is that our offer was 
received well.  They were more open and relaxed then they were on Wed. 
morning and made several encouraging comments about our price range, (once we 
talked through the price movements), and the seriousness of our gas related 
activities on the West Coast of India, in light of the IOC agreement.  I 
think the overall package is attractive to them and no serious objections 
were raised.  We did talk to some extent about the guarantees, but we didn't 
get too far and they're willing to accept at this point that what's 
acceptable to the LNG suppliers, should be suitable for their needs.  
However, they would like to understand the corporate structure and assets of 
Enron Energy Marketing a little better and I told them I would get back to 
them on that point.

David and Ajay were up in Hazira yesterday looking at some property for their 
gas treatment facility, which apparently is across the road from pipeline 
access.  While there they went and looked at Shell's proposed LNG site after 
walking the last 1 km, inaccessible to their 4wd vehicle and not surprisingly 
found a beach.

In summary, here is what we offered on a non-binding basis:

Six year production plateau
85% TOP
$3.67/MMBtu Net, at a base of $18/bbl Brent, with point of sale at the 
tail-end of the gas processing plant
Floor & Cap of $15.50 - $27.00/bbl
Price movement:  +/- $1.00/ bbl from the $18/bbl base price (on a 3 mo. 
rolling average) equals +/- $0.145/MMBtu fixed on a quarterly basis
Guarantees:  Same protection we're providing the LNG suppliers under the 
Trust Retention Account

I appreciate everyone's help in submitting this offer.

Thanks,
Doug
