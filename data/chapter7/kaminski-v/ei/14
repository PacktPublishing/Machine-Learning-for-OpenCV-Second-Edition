Vince,

From the sound of the articles, it appears ENE is ready to exit India, or=
=20
alternately to get into an arbitration battle.

I have scheduled some time with you at 10.30 to discuss.

Godbole=01,s report unearths absurd calculations , Maharashtra could use th=
is to=20
wriggle out of the Dabhol project , Sucheta Dalal

It is finally Quit India time for Enron. Though the controversial=20
multinational has denied plans to sell its stake in Dabhol Power Company=20
(DPC), informed sources say that it has sent feelers to China Light & Power=
=20
and others to offload its majority holding.Getting out of India may be the=
=20
best course for Enron. Though it has threatened a fight and invoked politic=
al=20
force majeure, the Energy Review Committee headed by Madhav Godbole will=20
certainly weaken its case. The committee points out that the many=20
=01&infirmities=018 in the DPC approval process brings into question the =
=01&propriety=20
of the decisions=018.

 It is clear that the $20m that Enron spent on educating India=01,s=20
policy-makers and bureaucrats did not even teach them the basics of=20
techno-economic appraisal or due procedure with regard to large internation=
al=20
contracts. The committee says it is =01&troubled with the failure of govern=
ance=20
that seems to have characterised almost every step of the decision making=
=20
process on matters relating to DPC. The failure of governance has been broa=
d,=20
across different governments at different points of time, at both the state=
=20
and the central level, and across different agencies associated with=20
examining the project and at both the administrative and political levels. =
It=20
strains belief to accept that such widespread and consistent failure to=20
execute assigned responsibilities is purely co-incidental=018.

Though the committee decided that it is not the proper forum to investigate=
=20
these infirmities, its two key members, Mr Godbole, and former secretary in=
=20
the Ministry of Finance, EAS Sarma, have asked for a judicial inquiry into=
=20
the process of clearing the DPC project. Other members felt a judicial=20
inquiry would delay the negotiation process and =01&not serve any purpose=
=018.=20
There may be some merit in an argument against a further delay in=20
renegotiating tariffs or facilitating Enron=01,s exit, but the report certa=
inly=20
provides the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) with all the grounds that i=
t=20
needs to start an investigation.

CVC N Vittal has already received innumerable requests to investigate the=
=20
deal, especially the beneficiaries of its education campaign. Though the=20
political establishment may be reluctant to set up a judicial inquiry, the=
=20
CVC can establish whether there are lapses on the part of =01&government=20
functionaries including political executives=018 and ensure =01&appropriate=
 action=018=20
against them. If it is indeed able to establish =01&undue influence=018 in =
signing=20
the contract, then Maharashtra may be able to get out of a deal patently=20
against the public interest without any monetary liability.

The Godbole committee has vindicated the stand of anti-Enron activists who=
=20
have been opposed it since negotiations began in 1994. It establishes that=
=20
Enron power is expensive per se, and the project needs to be re-negotiated,=
=20
regardless of the causes for the Maharashtra State Electricity Board=01,s (=
MSEB)=20
financial distress. Also that DPC=01,s extortionate tariffs are not merely=
=20
because of the steep rise in petro-product prices and rupee depreciation, b=
ut=20
mainly on account of its sweetheart deal with the state government. Enron=
=01,s=20
contract is clearly one-sided; it deliberately uses expensive raw material=
=20
(ignoring World Bank warnings), has worked on fanciful demand-supply=20
estimates and several legal requirements and permissions.

In fact, the committee has found that the MSEB has been paying Enron Rs 930=
=20
crore more than it should every year. This comprises overcharging of Rs 253=
=20
crore on account of the large regassification plant of which only 42 per ce=
nt=20
of the capacity is used for DPC. There=01,s also a Rs 100 crore extra billi=
ng to=20
the MSEB for shipping and harbour charges although the cost of these=20
facilities had been included in the capital recovery charge. By charging mo=
re=20
than twice the operations & maintenance rate stipulated by the government o=
f=20
India, Enron collects approximately Rs 246 crore extra every year. It has=
=20
also been collecting Rs 332 crore every year through inflated fuel=20
consumption claims. Enron has been charging at 1878 kcal/kwh under the powe=
r=20
purchase agreement (PPA) although the equipment manufacturer has guaranteed=
=20
it a much lower consumption rate. This gives it a fat fuel arbitrage=20
opportunity at the cost of the people of Maharashtra.=20

The committee has also pointed to the strange practice of using four=20
different exchange rates for different aspects of the project negotiation: =
a=20
rate of Rs 32 per dollar was assumed for calculating debt service of rupee=
=20
loans, Rs 34.5 per dollar as reference rate for Phase-I, Rs 39.35 per dolla=
r=20
as reference rate for Phase-II and a curious Rs 42 per dollar for calculati=
ng=20
Government of India tariff. Forcing a reduction of these excessive charges=
=20
has nothing to do with contract cancellation. All it needs is tough=20
negotiation and public pressure on the political establishment.=20

The Godbole committee has established that DPC=01,s tariffs can easily be h=
alved=20
if excess payments are eliminated and unfair conditions such as the=20
dollarisation of payments, the take-or-pay clause and escrow facility (whic=
h=20
is in fact hampering MSEB=01,s reform particularly in power distribution) a=
re=20
scrapped.The security of future payments to DPC under the restructured tari=
ff=20
would be based on increased cash flows from a reformed distribution system.=
=20
The committee also gives Enron a difficult escape route. It says that if th=
e=20
multinational finds the conditions for restructuring too onerous, it should=
=20
free MSEB from its contractual obligations and find buyers outside=20
Maharashtra. The committee has tried to establish another precedent on all=
=20
projects negotiated by government: =01&The public has a right to know what =
is=20
being contracted on their behalf=018 and has recommended that all documents=
,=20
including contracts related to all Independent Power Projects (IPPs),=20
particularly DPC, should be published by the Maharashtra government within=
=20
two months.

Also, having established that demand-supply estimates by the state governme=
nt=20
were fanciful, the committee has asked MSEB to defer all negotiations with=
=20
power producers until demand levels in the state permit full absorption of=
=20
power generation from such IPPs. It recommends that such negotiations shoul=
d=20
be in accordance with the least-cost plan spelt out by the report. This=20
should also end the hectic lobbying by Reliance (Patalganga), Mittals=20
(Bhadravati), the BSES (Saphale) and others to set up IPPs in Maharashtra.

e=20
state government and MSEB have been exploring the possibilities of issuing=
=20
termination notice to the DPC for its failure to meet the contractual=20
obligations under the PPA. The state government and MSEB sources said that=

such a notice could be served by the MSEB as DPC has not paid the rebate=20
(penalty) of Rs 409 crore for misdeclaration and default on the availabilit=

The state government and MSEB, which reviewed its position on Saturday at a=

The Real Story Of Dabhol If a judicial probe, suggested by the committee, i=

"The Committee has prima facie found infirmities in several decisions taken=
=20
in respect of the Enron project at different points of time by successive=
=20
governments and agencies in the Centre and state."
--Energy Review Committee headed by former home secretary Madhav Godbole

This could well be the real Enron story
A five-member high-powered committee headed by Madhav Godbole=01*and includ=
ing=20
former Union economic affairs secretary E.A.S. Sarma, hdfc chairman Deepak=
=20
Parekh, teri chairman RajendraPachauri and Maharashtra government official=

Vinay Mohan Lal=01*has recommended a judicial probe into the entire Enron p=
ower=20
project deal saying it signified "the utter failure of governance that seem=
s=20
to have characterised almost every step of the decision-making process=20
relating to the Dabhol project". The report, which was submitted to the=20
Maharashtra government last fortnight and has been acquired by Outlook, is=
=20
severely critical of former chief minister Sharad Pawar (with the Congress=

Committee Report

An investigation, if ordered, could embarrass at least these three=20
governments The report clearly upholds the allegations of money being paid =
by=20
Enron to politicians and bureaucrats for clinching the deal. According to t=
he=20
committee, the deal reveals failure of governance, both at the Centre and=
=20
state, and across different agencies. "It strains belief to accept that suc=
h=20
widespread and consistent failure to execute responsibilities is purely=20
coincidental," the report said, proposing a set of measures to be implement=
ed=20
if something of the project was to be retrieved. Godbole and Sarma also fel=
t=20
that the panel should categorically recommend the government of India to=20
order a judicial inquiry. This was finally adopted by it. Says a Congress=
=20
leader: "Enron could well become the biggest political issue in Maharashtra=
=20
and put to question liberalisation, particularly in the power sector."

The proposal has already struck panic. Says ncp's Praful Patel: "If the Enr=
on=20
decision has at all been detrimental, it is because of the haste with which=
=20
phase 2 was cleared by the Shiv Sena-bjp government. Now with the state=20
having already entered into an agreement with Enron, the important thing is=
=20
to resolve it amicably. A judicial inquiry will be an eyewash because it's=
=20
not an issue of corruption but that of perception."=20

Pro-market Congressmen privately admit that it was their governments at the=
=20
Centre and the state which invited Enron, even though the second phase was=
=20
cleared by the bjp-Shiv Sena combine. Says Congress spokesperson Jaipal=20
Reddy: "Right now we're too involved with the Parliament deadlock  over=20
Tehelka." Pro-liberalisation Congress MPs also fear that such witch-hunting=
=20
could send wrong signals to foreign investors. Non-Congress MPs from=20
Maharashtra, meanwhile, claim that the Godbole Committee was instituted wit=
h=20
the express purpose of politicising the Enron issue. "I think I know Vilasr=
ao=20
Deshmukh's gameplan," says an MP from the state. But some MPs like Congress=
'=20
Prithviraj Chavan question the cloak of secrecy that's surrounded the deal:=
=20
"I've maintained for long that there should be a judicial committee to=20
examine this=018.

The committee report also says that had the Enron project been subjected to=
 a=20
techno-economic appraisal, as envisaged under provisions of the Electricity=
=20
supply Act of 1948 and related legislations, the infirmities could have bee=
n=20
avoided.Since this wasn't done, questions about a concerted effort towards=
=20
exercising undue influence at every stage of the project are bound to arise=
,=20
the exhaustive 93-page report points out.

"I'd highlight the speed with which the 13-day Vajpayee government cleared=
=20
the project minutes before it quit," says Congress MP Prithviraj Chavan.=20


The Enron project had been held out as an exemplar of the impending=20
liberalisation in the early '90s and, despite several controversies, is now=
=20
an established power project at Dabhol, 150 km south of Mumbai. In July 199=
2,=20
Enron signed an MoU with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (mseb) to=
=20
set up a 2,550 MW station as part of the government's 'fast track' projects=
.

Subsequently, when the Shiv-Sena-bjp came to power in Maharashtra it filed =
a=20
writ against the project. This curiously led to renegotiations with Enron.=
=20
The committee has quoted a Bombay High Court order on the renegotiated deal=
. =20
"Once it (GoM) decided to revive the project, it acted in the very same=20
manner its predecessors in office had done. It forgot all about competitive=
=20
bidding and transparency. The speed with which the negotiating group studie=
d=20
the project and made its proposal for renegotiatons, which was accepted by=
=20
Dabhol, is unprecedented." Says Chavan: "I would particularly like to=20
highlight the speed with which the 13-day Vajpayee government at Centre=20
endorsed the renegotiated project minutes before it resigned."


Since the commissioning of the plant in May 1999, the mseb has paid Rs 1,60=
7=20
crore for the power it has bought from Dabhol. If the same watttage of powe=
r=20
had been bought from Indian-built power plants fired by indigenous coal, th=
e=20
payment would have been approximately Rs 736 crore. In the first=20
year-and-a-half of its operation itself, the dpc had drained the Maharashtr=
a=20
exchequer of nearly Rs 1,000 crore.

The Central Electricity Authority (cea), in fact, pointed out that the Dabh=
ol=20
plant was not the least costly option. The mseb had other inexpensive=20
alternatives like the four units of Kaparkheda, but they were in a=20
preliminary stage. The report notes: "...if the mseb had made efforts to=20
seriously pursue these projects, they might not have remained in their=20
preliminary stages". It adds that the members were of the opinion that "the=
=20
mseb and the Maharashtra government erred seriously, based on information=
=20
available at that time, in proceeding with the dpc as a base-load factor ev=
en=20
when its capacity was reduced." The failure seems to have been compounded b=
y=20
the laxity of the Union power ministry, finance ministry and the cea. It=20
quotes the cea as saying that since the Union finance ministry found the=20
tariff reasonable, no further examination was required

Strangely, Bal Thackeray's Shiv Sena, when it came to power together with t=
he=20
BJP in Maharashtra, filed a writ in the court and then renegotiated the dea=
l.=20

After the new Shiv Sena-bjp government took over, its CM, Manohar Joshi,=20
appointed a renegotiating committee in 1996 which made the right noises,=20
actually managing to reduce the tariff. But certain things remained=20
inexplicable. No fresh clearances were required from the cea, which also sa=
id=20
that "since no cost increase was involved...fresh formal clearance wasn't=
=20
necessary." Says the committee: "This only adds strength to the suspicion=
=20
that the cea didn't consider the economic aspects of the project at all.=20
Indeed, given the non-availability of any official record of the meeting on=
=20
June 24, 1994, with the Committee and the nature of this letter dated=20
December 23, 1994, the Committee is doubtful whether the economic aspects o=
f=20
dpc were discussed at all.''

The credibility of the Shiv Sena-bjp government has been seriously=20
questioned. "The Committee finds it unexplicable (sic) why there was no=20
mention of any reduction in capital cost of the project from $2,828 million=
=20
to $2,501 million as agreed by dpc in the summary report of the renegotiati=
ng=20
committee," the panel observes.Says lawyer Prashant Bhushan: "It is strange=
=20
that the Shiv Sena-bjp government first filed a writ in the court and then=
=20
coolly renegotiated the deal." The committee further spells out the losses=
=20
incurred through the deal. "Subsequent to the commissioning of the dpc, the=
=20
financial deterioration of mseb has been rapid. While the mseb was in profi=
t=20
in 1998-99, it plunged into huge losses of Rs 1681 crore in 1999-2000."=20

Significantly, the World Bank in 1993 had predicted the system's inherent=
=20
weaknesses. In a letter written to the then power secretary, R. Vasudevan, =
a=20
top bank official had said that "after a detailed review of the analytical=
=20
framework and costing assumptions, we reconfirm our earlier conclusion that=
=20
the Dabhol project, as presently formulated, is not economically justified"=
=20
and that in "our assessment the project is too large to enter the mseb syst=
em=20
in 1998. The proposed base-load operation could result in uneconomic plant=
=20
dispatch, as already existing lower variable cost coal power would be=20
replaced by the higher cost lng power."

Enron's persistence and the 'gullibility' of the Indian side can be gauged=
=20
from high-ranking Enron official Joe Sutton's letter to a key Indian=20
official, Ajit Nimbalkar: "I recently met with the World Bank and have been=
=20
following the articles in the India papers. I feel that the World Bank=20
opinion can be changed. We'll engage a PR firm and hopefully manage the med=
ia=20
from here on. The project has solid support from all other agencies in=20
Washington."

The key question in the Enron deal is whether a developed state like=20
Maharashtra needs outside intervention in the power sector at all? For the=
=20
first time the Godbole committee has raised objections about the viability =
of=20
such a project. According to the report, the mseb has been one of the bette=
r=20
performing boards in the country and has, despite a faulty transmission and=
=20
distribution (T and D) system, managed to consistently earn net revenue=20
surpluses on an accrual basis.

Maharashtra accounts for nearly one-fourth of the gross value of India's=20
industrial sector. It's one of the few states to achieve 100 per cent=20
electrification. Since '95, the mseb has been adding to its generation. "Th=
is=20
improvement, which has been largely due to renovation and modernisation=20
undertaken by the mseb, exceeded its own expectations at a time when the dp=
c=20
was being considered," the report points out. Following a policy of=20
cross-subsidy, roughly nine out of its ten users are subsidised.

But the gap between the average cost of supply and average realisation hasn=
't=20
been much. In fact, the subsidy claim decreased from Rs 630 crore in 1995-9=
6=20
to Rs 355 crore in 1998-99, until in 1999-2000 it increased nearly five-fol=
d=20
to Rs 2,084 crore due to the sudden increase in the gap by 26 paise per uni=
t=01*
from 15 to 41 paise=01*an increase of 173 per cent. "The increase in the su=
bsidy=20
claim by Rs 1,729 crore is due to the increase in the gap principally becau=
se=20
of the increase in power purchase costs," says the committee, adding:=20
"Without the dpc and without problems of T and D loss, the mseb could be=20
financially healthy."

But can that happen now since Enron is here to stay? The committee has come=
=20
up with some far-reaching recommendations: make public all Dabhol-related=
=20
documents and agreements, restructure the Dabhol project itself to bring do=
wn=20
the cost of power, restructure dpc financially, allow sale of dpc power=20
outside Maharashtra, re-examine ppas in accordance with least-cost plans, a=
nd=20
thoroughly reform the mseb.The committee know this can become reality only=
=20
with political consensus and through forming of public opinion. The questio=
n=20
is, can that be achieved in an unstable political environment?

MSEB revenue collections up at Rs 968 crore in March , Renni Abraham=20

The Maharashtra State Electricity Board's (MSEB) revenue collections in Mar=
ch=20
2001 stood at a record Rs 968 crore. This was largely due to the=20
disconnection drive on defaulter connections -- pegged at nearly 20,000=20
disconnections a month -- which resulted in compliance by consumers. With t=
he=20
Dabhol Power Company (DPC) monthly financial burden issue now a topic of=20
discussion among arbitrators on the negotiating table, the MSEB has turned =
to=20
putting its house in order.=20

As if to ward of any criticism of its fiscal condition that could be termed=
=20
as the facilitator to the entire DPC tariff crisis, the state electricity=
=20
board has put matters relating to its performance on record. For instance,=
=20
MSEB has recorded the highest power generation in the year ended March 31,=
=20
2001, at 45930 units, compared with the previous year's 45582 units, making=
=20
it the top SEB of the country in this respect. Similarly its power stations=
=20
recorded the highest availability percentage at 86.1 up from 84.6 per cent=
=20
last fiscal. Plant load factor is up to 72.78 per cent, compared with 71.7=
=20
per cent in 2000.=20

The Parli power station has recorded the highest ever generation in the ten=
=20
years of its life time in 2000 at 4545 million units, which made it eligibl=
e=20
for the meritorious productivity award under the eligibility guidelines=20
issued by the Government of India carrying a cash award of Rs 12.5 lakh. Al=
l=20
other power stations in the state, without exception, also fulfill the=20
eligibility criteria for the cash award, a senior MSEB official said.=20
Similarly, the Chandrapur power station became the first power station of a=
ny=20
state electricity board to get the ISO 9002 certification.=20

A senior MSEB official said: "Earlier MSEB was suffering from too much=20
interference in its day to day functioning. The agriculturists were touted =
as=20
the major reason for its deteriorating accruals, while theft of electricity=
=20
during the transmission and distribution stage was conveniently camouflaged=
=20
under this head. In the recent past, the government has authorised MSEB to=
=20
take steps to curb this misuse of power by its own officials, many of whom,=
