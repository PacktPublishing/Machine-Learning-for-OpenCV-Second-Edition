from its lenders.=20

The lenders had arrived at a consensus that the termination notice need not=

lenders, who have an exposure of about $2 billion in the project. Sources=

the backdrop of a dispute between MSEB and DPC over payment of bills.=20
After MSEB failed to pay Rs 102 crore towards the December 2000 bill, DPC=

invoked the state government's guarantee and then the Union government's=20
counter guarantee. When payment of the Rs 127-crore January bill became=20
overdue, DPC again invoked the state government's guarantee. MSEB retaliate=

on January 28, 2001 by slapping a Rs 401-crore penalty for non-supply of=20
electricity at adequate levels. It demanded that DPC adjust the bills again=

this penalty. "This stand of MSEB was explained to DPC at the board meeting=

a state government official said. The Centre also supported MSEB's stand an=

that additional assistance to DPC=01,s phase-II will be held in abeyance de=

DPC=20
president & CEO Neil McGregor to serve the termination notice, and transfer=
=20
notices to MSEB, following Wednesday=01,s DPC board meeting in London.
The essence of the message from the international lenders following the=20
London meeting with DPC board is: Emotions do not work. Contractual=20
obligations and payments have to be met. We are convinced that the MSEB has=
=20
failed to meet its obligations. There is no point in Enron continuing with=

the project and the company should get out of it.The structuring of DPC=01,=

clear and stressed in no uncertain terms by international lenders were: a)=

DPC and c) MSEB adopted a confrontational position by slapping a Rs 401 cro=

power.
While local lenders led by IDBI =01* with MSEB parroting the same =01* were=
 of the=20
view that the current situation is a temporary one, international lenders=
=20
were steadfast that pulling out of the project is the only way out. This is=
=20
despite the stance taken by IDBI and MSEB that authorisation for terminatio=

given to Mr Cline and Mr McGregor was not called for. International bankers=

pointed out that they will now have to look at the issue of charges and=20
protection for their loans in the event of the power project being scrapped=

in its present form.The points of contention are: a) that phase-I of DPC is=

backed by a sovereign guarantee b) phase-II is not and c) to the extent tha=

phase-II is covered by assets, cancellation of phase-II may see all assets =

THE HINDU, Friday, April 27, 2001
Offer of renegotiation 'too late': Enron, By Mahesh Vijapurkar=20
MUMBAI, APRIL 26. The Enron-sponsored Dabhol Power Company, which last nigh=
t=20
authorised its local management to issue a notice of termination of its Pow=
er=20
Purchase Agreement (PPA) with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, has=
=20
decided to keep a stiff upper lip. This, in turn, has stoked speculation th=
at=20
the switching off of power from its Phase I plant was imminent, while in=20
reality, a lengthy procedure has to be followed as prescribed within the PP=
A.=20
As one source familiar with the PPA told The Hindu, ``it is not sudden deat=
h=20
of the project'' and in all probability, the DPC, vexed with the=20
developments, including sharp and pointed observations by the Godbole=20
Committee, has chosen to only arm itself with a serious option. ``This woul=
d=20
only eventually come into effect. It is not an overnight operation and a lo=
t=20
of legal work is involved''. Apparently, the DPC intends to do some=20
arm-twisting.=20
At the board of directors meeting in London, which Maharashtra was initiall=
y=20
disinclined to attend but later used the forum to put across its contention=
s=20
on the project, the DPC squarely told the MSEB nominees on the board that t=
he=20
offer of renegotiation had come rather ``too late''. It also said it did no=
t=20
see any room for optimism about the outcome. It did not, however, rule out=
=20
the option of talks, thus underscoring the possibility that the decision to=
=20
authorise termination was a new weapon.=20
The Maharashtra Chief Minister, Mr. Vilasrao Deshmukh, had hoped that DPC=
=20
would not take any ``harsh step'' which would cause lot of damage to the=20
interests of both the independent power producer and the Government and tod=
ay=20
he expressed his dismay. In fact, the mandate of the team that went, on the=
=20
strength of its stake in the DPC, was to put across the idea that negotiati=
on=20
was the requirement and not confrontation.=20
Echo in LS=20
The Enron issue also echoed in the Lok Sabha today where the Power Minister=
,=20
Mr. Suresh Prabhu, said that scrapping of the agreement would cost the Cent=
re=20
Rs. 2,840 crores, whose liability in the project agreement was limited. The=
=20
Centre's liability in case of termination is one year's electricity bill an=
d=20
a termination fee of $300 million.=20
Blow to FIs=20
The termination could prove to be a serious blow to the Indian Financial=20
Institutions (FIs) which, under the leadership of the IDBI, were trying to=
=20
convince the other lenders of the project against the notice. The exposure =
of=20
Indian FIs in the project is understood to be not covered by any guarantee=

either of the Centre or the State.=20

The Dabhol Power Company board, which met on Wednesday in London, authorise=

=20
foreign lenders supported Enron on the termination issue, domestic financia=

the deliberations to oppose any such drastic move. Enron needs the lenders'=
=20
consent to file a pre-termination notice for pulling out from the project.=
=20
The decision to empower DPC chief Wade Cline to issue a termination notice=
=20
was taken with six votes in favour against a single IDBI vote against such =
a=20
move.=20
Another significant development during the entire proceedings was that the=

financial institutions made it clear that further funding of Phase II of th=

project will depend on the Government of India assuring payment mechanisms.=
=20
Institutions are yet to disburse about 30 per cent of the sanctioned packag=
e,=20
which is crucial for completing the Phase II expansion project. ``The board=
=20
has given powers to Wade Cline to issue a pre-termination notice. But the=
=20
meeting quite unanimously felt the need of the hour is not to terminate the=
=20
project but to initiate serious re-negotiation proceedings,'' said MSEB=20
Chairman Vinay Bansal, who attended the board meeting. ``MSEB presented the=
ir=20
views to the board members and it was understood by Enron which also includ=

the Rs 401 crore penalty issue which is heading for arbitration proceedings=
.=20
``We have also made it clear that the tariff structure of Enron is quite hi=
gh=20
and a downward revision of tariffs is unavoidable," Bansal added.=20
``They cannot issue a termination notice without our consent since our=20
exposure in the project is quite large and the lenders should approve any=

plans in that direction,'' said a top banker who was present during the=20
lenders' meet. ``There is a general consensus that the project must be=20

Credit Suisse First Boston, ABN-AMRO, Citibank and the State Bank of India,=

where all these parties conducted separate meetings with the company=20
officials. However, some bankers said the company can file a termination=20
notice even if one lender with a minimum 5 per cent exposure on the project=
=20
favours such proceedings.=20
Meanwhile, in a clear reversal of roles, Maharashtra Chief Minister Vilasra=
o=20
Deshmukh said that the state government was not keen on terminating the PPA=

``We will ask them to refrain from taking any such harsh steps since that=

added that termination of the project would not hurt foreign investments, a=

THE PIONEER, Friday, April 27, 2001
Enron testing Maharashtra's nerves, T N Raghunatha
Dabhol Power Company (DPC) has begun to put fresh pressure on the Maharasht=
ra=20
State Electricity Board (MSEB), the Maharashtra State Government and the=20
Centre for an early resolution to the prolonged dispute between them, if th=
e=20
DPC Board of Directors' decision to authorise its managing director to serv=
e=20
a contract termination notice to the MSEB is any indication.
The DPC Board, in its meeting in London on Wednesday, empowered the company=
=20
management to sever its power supply agreement with MSEB, a move that could=
=20
inflict a financial liability of Rs 2,840 crore on the Centre. The decision=
=20
to authorise the DPC management to issue a termination notice to MSEB was=
=20
taken by a vote of six to one after the Maharasthra Government=20
representatives were prevented from voting on the ground of "interested=20
party".
When contacted, the company's Mumbai-based spokesperson, Mr Jimmy Mogal,=20
declined to comment on the reports about the decision taken by the DPC Boar=
d.=20
"We have nothing to say on the reports emanating from London. We will expre=
ss=20
our views after a few days," he said. However, Maharashtra Chief Minister=
=20
Vilasrao Deshmukh on Thursday termed the DPC board's decision as=20
"unfortunate". "We have already requested the company not to take any harsh=
=20
decision", Mr Deshmukh said in Mumbai.=20
Official sources in the State Energy Ministry interpreted the DPC Board's=
=20
decision as a pressure tactic employed by the Enron subsidiary to force the=
=20
MSEB to clear the pending power bills without any further delay. Through it=
s=20
tough posture, the DPC wants to make its position stronger before it can=20
formally agree for re-negotiations with the MSEB, the Centre and the State=
=20
Government for cutting the price of power supplied by it to the State=20
electricity board. The sources said that the DPC's reported decision to=20
authorise its managing director to stop electricity supply to the MSEB did=
=20
not mean that the Enron subsidiary would actually go ahead with the scrappi=
ng=20
of the power contract with the MSEB.
"If anything, the DPC's reported decision is to mount additional pressure o=
n=20
the MSEB for clearance of pending power bills and put itself in a stronger=
=20
position in settling its dispute with the MSEB. As part of its plan to arm=
=20
itself with powers to break a contract in case situation goes beyond its=20
control, the DPC had recently served a political force majeure to the MSEB,=
=20
the Centre and the State Government," the sources said.Not surprisingly, th=
e=20
DPC's London decision comes on the heels of the Maharashtra Government's=20
decision to set up a high-level committee, comprising representatives of th=
e=20
MSEB, the Centre and the State Government to re-negotiate with the Enron's=
=20
subsidiary company for reducing the cost of power supplied to the State=20
electricity board.Meanwhile, amidst the threat of a possible termination=20
notice hanging on its head, the MSEB on Thursday made a "protest payment" o=
f=20
the Rs 134 crore disputed amount towards March bill of Rs 146.64 crore to D=

decision coincided with a Rs 134-crore =01+protest payment=01, by the cash-=

power board as part of the March bill worth Rs 146.64 crore.
There was speculation that MSEB coughed up the amount to cool frayed temper=

at Enron=01,s hub in Houston, and because it was rattled by the sudden turn=
 of=20
events in the past few days during which the dispute had come to a head. MS=

Company deciding to authorise the managing director, Mr K Wade Cline, to=20
serve a notice of termination on the contract for the first phase of the $2=
.9=20
billion power project.The decision, which could lead to the cessation of=20
Dabhol=01,s power supply to the state, was taken at the meeting held yester=
day=20
in London according to reports quoting the chairman of the Maharashtra Stat=
e=20
Electricity Board, Mr Vinay Bansal.=20
While DPC officials refuse to comment on anything, it is learnt that MSEB w=
as=20
itself prepared to serve a legal notice of termination just two days before=
=20
the meeting.MSEB was said to have been dissuaded by the Nationalist Congres=
s=20
Party president, Mr Sharad Pawar, and union power minister Mr Suresh Prabhu=
,=20
who had talks in New Delhi with the Maharashtra chief minister, Mr Vilasrao=
=20
Deshmukh, and an MSEB delegation last Monday.
The state government has been served two arbitration notices while the Cent=
re=20
is ready to go for conciliation with the DPC for failing to honour its=20
counter-guarantee.Further, the DPC has already slapped a notice of politica=
l=20
force majeure which protects itself against undeserved claims in the event =
of=20
exigencies that force it to take an extreme step.The union power minister, =
Mr=20
Suresh Prabhu, contended in Delhi that since DPC contributed only 0.7 per=
=20
cent of the total energy output of the country, its termination would not=
=20
have such a phenomenal impact on the power situation.=20
However, if terminations proceedings go through, Enron Corp, a 65 per cent=
=20
share-holder in the Dabhol Power Company, would stand to net a hefty amount=
=20
in damages. The union power secretary has been quoted as saying that=20
termination of the DPC would cost the Centre Rs 1,800 crore, which is the=
=20
total of one years=01, electricity bill and a termination fee of $300 milli=
on.=20
According to an energy analyst, Mr Pradyumna Kaul, the total liability woul=
d=20
not cross Rs 350 crore. However Mr Prabhu said in the Lok Sabha today that=
=20
the that scrapping of the agreement would cost the Centre Rs 2,840 crore.It=
=20
is learnt that on 20 April, Mr Deshmukh had given the go-ahead to the MSEB =
to=20
prepare a legal notice to be issued to Enron during the meeting of the DPC=
=01,s=20
Board of Directors on Wednesday. At the meeting, the energy minister,=20
Padamsinh Patil, energy secretary, Mr Vinay Mohan Lal and MSEB chairman Mr=
=20
Vinay Bansal, were also present.The notice was prepared over the past weeke=
nd=20
and taken by the delegation when they called on Mr Prabhu on 24 April.=20
However, the politicians convinced them that Enron would not get tough, giv=

its huge stake in the project, and that such a notice would not be necessar=
y.=20
The meeting thus ended with the decision to renegotiate the power tariff,=
=20
with Enron=01,s consent.
Among those present at the London meeting were Mr Lal, Mr Bansal and MSEB=
=20
technical director, Mr P Paunikar, in their capacity as directors. However,=
=20
they abstained from voting since they were deemed an interested party. The=

only vote to go against the decision was that of the IDBI which is also=20
represented on the board, it is learnt.The chief minister, Mr Vilasrao=20
Deshmukh, said the state was not in favour of terminating the project. This=

could mean that the latest manoeuvre to arm-twist the Indian authorities=20
could achieve its immediate target of getting the arrears accumulated over=

complete powers with regard to DPC's operations in the state, including the=

authority to wind up operations, it does not necessarily mean that McGregor=

will issue such a termination notice. McGregor was given the powers at a=20

With regard to the state's failure to pay Enron, Ranganathan said, " Bills=

are prepared as per the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) and DPC owes some=20
money to us. Our people informed Enron officials about this.. In fact, ther=
e=20
was no reason to give powers to the MD to slap a termination notice."In the=

representatives insisted that the DPC must pay Rs 411 crore since it could=

not supply power whenever needed.=20
Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh has already termed as unfortunate the=20
decision of the board of the Enron-promoted DPC to give McGregor powers to=

 'ENRON'S ON!'=20
State govt. to renegotiate Dabhol Power Project , By Hubert Vaz=20
The US power giant, Enron Power Corporation's willingness to wrap up the=20
Dabhol Power Project and leave the shores may not actually materialise,=20
though the Dabhol Power Company chief, Mr. Wade Cline, has been authorised =
to=20
do so, since the lenders for the project would have a decisive say in the=
=20
matter.=20
Disclosing this, Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh confirmed this morning th=
at=20
the state government would churn out a compromise formula by which the powe=
r=20
project at Dabhol could be continued, and at the same time Enron did not fe=
el=20
slighted. "Enron has not yet conveyed to us about this decision. We are=20
waiting for their letter," he said. When asked what sort of compromise the=
=20
state government plans to forge, Mr. Deshmukh said, "Let our officers come=
=20
back. After that we will decide a future course of action. But we are=20
definitely going in for renegotiation of the project. It is very difficult =
to=20
predict the outcome of Enron's decision but as of now the project is still=
=20
on." When asked whether the project could be moved to another state, if wou=
nd=20
up from Maharashtra, Mr. Deshmukh said, that was not possible as per the=20
terms of the agreement between the US company and the state government.=20
However, it was difficult for the project to move out of the state itself, =
he=20
indicated. He also confirmed that both parties would face considerable loss=
es=20
if the project was terminated.=20
The board of directors of the Dabhol Power Company, which met in London on=
=20
Wednesday, decided to put an end to all controversies surrounding the proje=
ct=20
once and for all by empowering the DPC chief to terminate the project, if h=
e=20
deemed it fit. However, this decision, as of now, does not necessarily=20
indicate the death knell for the project. The Enron project, which had been=
=20
riddled with controversies right from its inception, had been a pretext for=
=20
the political parties in the state to drag each other on the mat from time =
to=20
time. The previous Sena-BJP government, which had been out to terminate the=
=20
project, however, chose to continue with it following renegotiations with=
=20
Enron's top visiting officials like Ms. Rebecca Mark. And, the Democratic=
=20
Front government inherited the controversial project when the governments=
=20
changed hands a year and a half ago.=20
Meanwhile, State Energy Minister Dr. Padamsinh Patil, when contacted at the=
=20
Osmanabad Circuit House, said the state government and the central governme=
nt=20
have decided to appoint a joint committee to renegotiate the project with=
=20
Enron. "It is not easy for them to walk out of the project just like that.=
=20
They will have to go in for litigation and this would prove costly for both=
=20
sides," he said. In case the project is terminated, the government can stil=
