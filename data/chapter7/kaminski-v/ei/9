=20
AMUL'S creative directors may have gone back to ad-libbing 'Enron or=20
Enr-off', but for the big kahuna at the American utility, Dabhol is still a=
=20
worthwhile project. While the entire Enron board had almost decided to call=
=20
it quits and proceed with the termination of the $2.9-billion  power projec=
t=20
at Dabhol, the veto exercised by the  company chairman Kenneth Lay has save=
d=20
the project =01*- at least for the timebeing. Sources said the meeting held=
 on=20
Tuesday at the energy major's headquarters in Houston could have sounded th=
e=20
death knell for the only big foreign investment in the Indian power sector.=
=20

Although the future of the project is still pretty uncertain with the lende=
rs=20
unwilling to continue disbursements unless payment obligations are not=20
honoured and contractual obligations left unfulfilled, the veto exercised a=
t=20
this juncture by the chairman of the parent company has come as a big boost=
=20
to the Indian venture. Company sources said: "We do not know what went on =
=20
there but it is true that as of now we are not pulling out."  With the=20
engineering procurement and construction contractors GE and equipment=20
suppliers Bechtel too in a  cautious mode mode, DPC was finding it even mor=
e=20
difficult to continue the construction of the project as per the schedules.=
=20
Sources said the stand taken by the rest of the directors on the board woul=
d=20
be in view of the backlash that the company would have to face from its=20
shareholders if the  project actually flopped.Enron had similar bitter=20
experiences in Pakistan and it was difficult for the parent company to then=
=20
justify such investments to the shareholders.=20

Enron, which had planned a major investments in India's infrastructure=20
sectors such as oil and gas, LNG, gas transportation, telecom and broadband=
=20
network, has already pulled out most of their personnel from some of these=
=20
operations. The company's MoUs with various other majors like Indian Oil=20
Corporation, too, is in a limbo and the US major's stake in the oil and gas=
=20
venture is up for grabs. However, even though Lay is still hoping to find a=
=20
solution  to the controversy back home, both DPC and MSEB are still to get=
=20
down to negotiations.

"there is no question of NTPC buying power from the project since long term=

Reliance allowed to hawk power from Patalganga to third parties=20
Arijit De, S Ravindran & Renni Abraham in Mumbai

 In an unusual departure from normal practice, the Maharashtra government h=
as=20
allowed the Reliance  group to sell power generated by its 447-mw  Patalgan=
ga=20
power project directly to third parties if   the Maharashtra State=20
Electricity Board (MSEB)  does not lift power. The project=01,s power purch=
ase=20
agreement (PPA) has a clause to this effect.  The state government=01,s=20
permission to Reliance to  hawk power to third parties has to be seen in th=
e=20
context of its dithering on forwarding to the Centre  the Dabhol Power=20
Company=01,s bid for mega power  status so that it could sell power to thir=
d=20
parties.=20

 DPC sources told Business Standard several weeks ago that the company=01,s=
=20
application had been pending with the Chief Minister=01,s office for months=
.=20
Only now has the state government authorised the Godbole committee to=20
negotiate with DPC on third  party sales outside the state. The DPC project=
=20
is facing the threat of closure  following MSEB=01,s inability to buy power=
 from=20
it,  thanks to the Board=01,s weak financial position.  Not only can the=20
Reliance group sell power to third parties within Maharashtra, but it can=
=20
sell power to utilities outside the state. The PPA does not  expressly bar =
it=20
from doing so. Nor does it specify the category of customers to whom power=
=20
can be sold. So, in effect, this suggests that the group could sell power t=
o =20
industrial and commercial customers in  Maharashtra and emerge as a rival t=
o=20
the MSEB.The state electricity board derives over 80 per cent  of its reven=
ue=20
from such consumers.=20

 Apart from captive power plants, independent power producers in India are=
=20
allowed to sell power only to  state electricity boards. They can sell powe=
r =20
outside the state only if they qualify for mega power project status.  With=
=20
its 447-mw capacity, the Patalganga project is not eligible for such status=
=20
because mega power  rojects are supposed to have a minimum capacity  of 1,0=
00=20
mw. Speaking on the sidelines of a press conference  last week, Reliance=20
Industries managing director  Anil Ambani told Business Standard: A provisi=
on=20
in third parties. Ambani was answering a question on whether the MSEB=01,s =
weak=20
financials and inability to offer escrow cover to the project as emphasised=
=20
in the Godbole committee report set up to defuse the Dabhol crisis would=20
derail the Patalganga project.=20

The PPA does not have any express restriction as to third party sale outsid=
e=20
the state, a Reliance spokesperson confirmed on Friday in a faxed  response=
=20
to questions.  A senior MSEB official explained that the state government=
=20
cleared private power projects some years ago on the basis of the=20
unrealistically high demand projections contained in a report by a former=
=20
MSEB official.  Subsequently, it was realised that the state would be stuck=
=20
with excess power. So the Reliance group was permitted to sell power to thi=
rd=20
parties, he said. The Patalganga project along with the Ispat group=01,s 1,=
082=20
mw Bhadravati project has been put on hold till the Godbole committee submi=
ts=20

No need of Patalganga, Bhadravati power: MSEB=20

THE AXE seems to have finally fallen on the much-delayed Reliance=20
Industries-promoted Patalganga and Ispat Industries' Bhadravati Power=20
projects in Maharashtra as  the state electricity board has firmly told the=
=20
government  that "there is no need of these projects nor their power". The=
=20
loss-making board has communicated to the government that MSEB had "no=20
interest" in Patalganga and Bhadravati, as it did not have escrow-able=20
capacity and also that industrial demand for power had slowed down  =20
tremendously in Maharashtra, state government sources  said here on Sunday.=
=20
"In last November itself, MSEB had sent an official intimation to the state=
=20
government informing its decision in  favour of cancellation of the two=20
projects on several grounds -- including they being unviable and=20
unaffordable," sources said. "Reliance's project is no different from that =
of=20
DPC's. Patalganga is also naphtha-based and its PPA is on similar lines...=
=20

After the Enron experience, MSEB cannot  even dream of another gas-based=20
power plant in the state," a senior MSEB official said. He said MSEB has=20
already asked the state government  not to provide escrow to both the 447-m=
w=20
Patalganga and  the 1,084-mw coal-based Bhadravati, "as the US energy major=
=20
has almost squeezed us of all over finances". When contacted, MSEB chairman=
=20
Vinay Bansal said: "Reliance and Ispat projects have been put on hold as pe=
r =20
the Godbole Committee's recommendations", but  expressed inability to give=
=20
further details.=20

Currently, Bhadravati and Patalganga projects have been  put on hold as per=
=20
Godbole Committee report, which was set up to review the DPC-MSEB PPA and=
=20
energy scenario in Maharashtra. "Can you go ahead with the project without =
an=20
escrow cover?" the committee was believed to have asked Ispat  and Reliance=
=20
representatives, to which the reply had been  negative, sources added.=20
Sources said, as of now, both the projects have not been able to achieve=20
financial closure as leading financial   institutions were not willing to=
=20
fund the projects which do  not have a "guaranteed payment" mechanism from=
=20
MSEB, which, incidentally it has promised to DPC. "All the three were clear=
ed=20
as 'fast-track' projects, but other than Enron, Reliance and Ispat have bee=
n=20
caught in a quagmire, especially Bhadravati, which has been hanging afire=
=20
since last nine years," they added.=20

Moreover, the MSEB official opined that given the current situation, if DPC=
=20
calls it quits from India, Bhadravati was a safer bet than Reliance's=20
Patalganga. Patalganga's power would be mere 50 paise less than that of DPC=
's=20
that ranges anywhere around approximately Rs  4.50 per unit to as high as R=
s=20
7, while Bhadravati's cost could be around Rs 3.80 to Rs 4 per unit, he=20
informed. MSEB's installed capacity ended on March 31, 2001, was14,000 mw a=
nd=20
it has generated 45,000 million units with transmission and distribution=20
losses as high as 39 per cent. (PTI)

Global bankers ask govt to honour DPC  obligations=20

controversial project. In a letter to finance secretary Ajit Kumar dated=20
April 30, the global arrangers said the  government must own up its=20

stiff conditions, set by the arrangers, are the demand that the central=20

GE may pull out as DPC supplier , S Ravindran in Mumbai

After US-based Bechtel, it is now the turn of General Electric to review it=
s=20
participation as equipment supplier to the controversial 2,184-mw power=20
project in Maharashtra, being set up by the Dabhol Power Company.Bechtel is=
=20
the EPC contractor to the project while GE has supplied the equipment,=20
primarily turbines.General Electric, like Bechtel, also holds 10 per cent i=
n=20
Dabhol Power Company (DPC). And both Bechtel and General Electric are worri=
ed=20
about future payments from DPC. Sources familiar with the project said that=
=20
so far DPC has not defaulted in its payments to General Electric. What is=
=20
worrying General Electric is the possible scenario after June 7, when about=
=20
700 mw power will be commissioned after the second phase  trial runs.

DPC and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board  (MSEB) have been locked in=
 a=20
payments dispute for months. If MSEB continues with its stance, DPC in turn=
=20
may not be able to pay General Electric. In such a situation, GE may walk o=
ut=20
of the project. A final decision will be taken only in June, said sources.=
=20
General Electric did not respond to a faxed questionnaire sent by Business=
=20
Standard. Senior executives at its public relations agency Burson  =20
Marsteller Roger Pereira said that only DPC executives were authorised to=
=20
speak on the issue. The DPC spokesman declined to comment on the issue.

The first phase of the 740 mw has already been commissioned. After the seco=
nd=20
phase of 1,444 mwis commissioned by December, 2001, MSEB will  have to pay=
=20
DPC a minimum of Rs 500 crore per month. The escrow account for this was to=
=20
have been made operational by April 7, 2001. MSEB has refused to do this.=
=20
Earlier, DPC had invoked the political force majeure clause in its contract=
=20
with the board. MSEB is now arguing that the invocation of this clause has=
=20
absolved DPC of all its liabilities.=20

Consequently, it will not operationalise the escrow account. This casts a=
=20
further shadow over DPC=01,s ability to pay General Electric and Bechtel. T=
his=20
is worrying the lenders to the project as well. The situation has taken a=
=20
turn for the worse with DPC practically refusing to re-negotiate the contra=
ct=20
for the second phase with the Godbole panel constituted by the Maharashtra=
=20
