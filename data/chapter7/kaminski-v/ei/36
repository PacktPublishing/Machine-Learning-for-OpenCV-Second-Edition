Subject: Request for visit and meeting

Hi Grant, we met briefly a couple of months ago. I work with Pedro in the 
Colombia office. We are working closely with Ecopetrol (Colombia's 
state-owned oil company) on a very important deal, and some of their highest 
ranking officials (3 of them) will like to visit our head quarters in early 
August, to share some ideas on risk management tools (very general concepts 
that can obviously be disclosed). 

My assumption is that Vince and your-self are the perfect people to have the 
meeting with. Several consulting firms have advice Ecopetrol to get in touch 
with Enron when referring to advance risk management techniques. Do you think 
this is possible? Please let me know, this means a great deal for this 
office, but I also know you guys are extremely busy. Thanks,

Carlos E
