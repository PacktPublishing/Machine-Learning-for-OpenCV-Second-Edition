Maureen,
The  Energy CEO Roundtable hosted by Gov. Johanns has been scheduled for 
April 20th 10a.m. -2 p. m. Does this date work for you?  As we have 
discussed, your presentation would provide the Governor and his guests with a 
national/ global perspective on pricing trends for natural gas , electricity 
and oil and their impact on agricultural production costs. We may also 
include a hedging presentation, but have not committed to do so yet. 
 Your presentation would be scheduled at the start of the meeting, w/ an 
anticipated length of twenty minutes.  A University of NE  ag economist will 
provide a state perspective for the group. Following the conclusion of both 
presentations time would be allotted for questions. We expect approximately 
20 people to attend the roundtable.
