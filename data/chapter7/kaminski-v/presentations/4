The $1.3 trillion tax cut which is frequently quoted by the press is over 10 
years, the $460 tax cut below is over five years.

I looked into the proposed tax cut by George W. Bush.  On his website he 
proposes a $460 billion tax cut over five years. 
 The $213 billion "energy tax" imposed  from 1999 to 2001 by higher energy 
prices, is roughly half of Bush's proposed tax cut.
