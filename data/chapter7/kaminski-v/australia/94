Chris,

Thanks for the invitation. I shall be glad to meet you and your family in 
Sydney at your home.

I am enclosing the draft of my part of the chapter. It's more than 
preliminary  but I hope
to improve it greatly over the weekend. I shall forward you a new version on 
Sunday evening
my time. Grant is moving along on his part. I  hope it reduces the penalty to 
broken knee-caps.

I shall send you a longer message from home to give you an update on my 
conversations
with EPRM  regarding the articles.


Vince

Hi Vince,
?
Just a friendly reminder that the hired guns are  making their way up to 
Houston to visit with you and Grant.
?
I was reading the promotional material for the EPRM  conference here in July. 
I wanted to invite you to dinner at my apartment on the  evening between the 
main conference and the post-conference seminars (18th  July). We have a 
pretty spectacular view of the Harbour here that you might  enjoy.
?
Best regards.
?
Chris.
