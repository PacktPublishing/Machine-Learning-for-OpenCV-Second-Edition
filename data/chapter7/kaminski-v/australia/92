Grant,

Sorry for the silence. It's definately not a commentary on your work - I've
been travelling back and forward between Sydney and London like a yo-yo and
trying to tidy up things on our end. I've been working on incoporating your
material and will spend all of tomorrow on this (hopefully!) so that I can
ask for the last few amendments before the w/end.

Many thanks and best regards.

Chris.
