Vince,
?
Just to let you know, the books will be shipped to both you and Rice  
University tomorrow by express mail, which means the books should arrive 
within  5 days (depending on customs).
?
Rice has purchased 25 books, and I informed them that if they don't sell  
them all, we will?credit their account?with the amount of unsold  copies.? 
I've asked them to?give you?any extra copies instead of  returning them.
?
Please find attached the invoice for the 50 books.
?
Thanks again, and if you need anything further, please let me know.
?
Julie
