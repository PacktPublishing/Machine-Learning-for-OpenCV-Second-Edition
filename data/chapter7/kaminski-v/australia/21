Julie,

There are many employees in London? who  would be interested.
You can send? an inquiry to Steve  Leppard.

I had a presentation last night
to GARP in Houston and did  a commercial for the book.
You should put me on  commission.

Vince

Vince,

I wasn't sure if I responded to  your email, so apologise either for my
delayed response or repeating  myself.

Thanks for the 2nd order! I believe they have already  been? dispatched.
Yes, I believe we received payment; thank you very  much for? following up
with Paul. Glad the book was a hit!

On  another subject, are there any Enron employees in Europe who may  be
interested in attending either the energy or the weather course? Or,  are
the quants and risk management mostly handled out of  Houston?

Thanks again, and I'll forward an invoice on to  Shirley.

Julie
