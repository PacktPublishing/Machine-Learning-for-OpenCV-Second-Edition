Fiona,
?
Thanks for your message and the update.? We haven't made  any changes.? I was 
referring to the Enron changes, and the electronic  brochure I sent to you 
yesterday.? In total, we have the following pieces  which list the Enron name:
?
-? Book cover
-? Bios which are on the cover and in the "Preface"  section of the book
-? Chapter 3 which was written by Vince Kaminski's  group
-? Electronic brochure
?
The first 3 pieces are the most important since they have to  do with the 
printing of the book.? If you could?get the modifications  to us by Thursday, 
that would be great.? 
?
Thanks, and look forward to hearing from you.
?
Julie
