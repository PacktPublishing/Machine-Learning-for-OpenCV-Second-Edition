Vince,
?
I have made contact with Fiona Grant, Director Public Relations and  
Communications Enron Europe Limited, and she mentioned that there are some  
changes to your bios, which are located both on the cover and in the 
preliminary  section in "About the Authors".? We would appreciate it if you 
could help  in?collecting or passing along these edits?since  these?are?the 
only items delaying the printing of the book.?  
Thanks Vince.
?
Regards,
Julie
