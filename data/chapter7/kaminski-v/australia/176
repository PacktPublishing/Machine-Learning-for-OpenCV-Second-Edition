Vince,

I spoke with Whalley at the SA offsite and he mentioned that had (or knew of) 
a person that could bring some talent to the evaluation of an Enron merchant 
business in Japan.  I am in Sydney today, but will be in Tokyo next week.  I 
would like to speak more about this.  What time might you be available?  My 
Japan mobile number is 81 90 4073 6761.

regards,

Joe
