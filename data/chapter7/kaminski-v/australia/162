I work with John Ambler in APACHI PR, and have been assisting Vince with 
efforts on the Energy Derivatives book, which Lacima Consultants is 
publishing and to which Vince is contributing a chapter.  Attached is the 
draft contract agreement, which requires your legal review and approval.  
Could you kindly look it over and let me know your comments.  When we have 
your approval, we will send Lacima a copy for their signature, after which 
Vince will sign the document.  We will ensure that your office has a copy for 
your records.
If you wish to speak to me, please do not hesitate to call me at ext. 66503.

Thank you for your kind assistance.
Habiba
