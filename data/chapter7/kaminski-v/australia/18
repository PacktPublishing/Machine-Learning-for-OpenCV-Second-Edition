Vince,
?
We just wanted to let you know that we only have 3 people signed up for the  
weather derivatives course (all from Enron) so far.? We have a couple more  
that have expressed strong interest, but we are awaiting their final  
decision.? If no one else signs up, Chris and Les thought that you guys  
could probably get through the first day pretty easily,?and thus thought it  
may be an option to teach just the 2nd day material (pricing) only at Enron  
(doing it at the Hyatt is an option as well but the room might be on the 
large  side)?? We would obviously reimburse you for the day not taught.? We  
can teach both days as well, but thought you may want to save some time.?  
?
I just wanted to give you some time to think about it.? We will know  where 
we stand on final numbers by next Wednesday.
?
Julie
