Stinson / Krishna,

Paul Q, Raymond Y and I will call 5.30pm Houston time Thursday afternoon to 
discuss. That is 8.30am Sydney time. If that is not convenient, I will call 
Krishna to arrange another time.

Regards,
Paul

Paul,

Krishna and I are thinking that you may be able to book this type of option 
as a call swaption on power.   If you would like to discuss further, let's 
set up a time when we can call you.

Subject: Real Options

Vince,

The Sydney office is currently evaluating a proposal that involves an option 
to participate in building a wind farm. Should this proceed, we would like to 
mark this option "to market".

Have the Research group completed any work on methods for booking and 
remarking real options? Alternatively, do you have any suggestions as to the 
best way to value, and book, real options fairly?

Regards
Paul Smith
