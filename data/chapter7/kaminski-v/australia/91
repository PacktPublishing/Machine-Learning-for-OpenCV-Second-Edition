Gentlemen,

Thankyou for your fine effort. I'll e-mail thru Thurs eve (Sydney time) what
we have done to incorporate it into our material (which wasn't toooo
painful) to see if it is OK with you. A couple of quick questions though.

Vince - your section had a number of footnote numbers, but no actual
footnotes - can you please resend them?

Grant - I agree it would be good to have the final figure. What happens if
you plot the historical data and the simulations on the same graph - but
with different axis?

Many thanks and best regards.

Chris.
