Vince,
?
I can offer you 12.5% off of your order for 50 books (we originally spoke  to 
Habiba about setting up a 50% discount?but Enron would have to order a  
minimum of 200 books.??since the?change over, nothing has been  set up on 
this).? 
?
Let me know if I should go ahead with the invoice.
?
Thanks,
Julie
