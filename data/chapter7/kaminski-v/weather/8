Mike...

In response to Phil Clifford's request - I have constructed webpage that 
provides wind, wave, and storm information for the production and 
tranportation areas of the North Atlantic.  I've linked the site from the 
Research Weather Homepage to the European Weather support page.  Here is the 
link:

http://ecthou-webcl1.corp.enron.com/research/Weather/Europe/europe_full.htm

From here - follow the:  "North Atlantic Production/Transport" link.  Let's 
see what customer feedback we get - and I will continue to investigate 
further avenues
 of support.
