Subject: weather article - photos?


Dear Joseph,

Thank you so much for sending me such an interesting article on the Internet
and weather derivatives. I really enjoyed reading it!

I just have one final question - do you have a photograph of yourself (or
the other authors) that you could send me? Tif, gif or jpeg files are fine
so long as they are 300 dpi.

Thanks again and I hope to hear from you soon.

Best regards,

Jane
