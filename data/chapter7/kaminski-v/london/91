Steve,

I shall call you tomorrow about it. My preference is to move Anjam to Houston
for some time. Anjam knows a lot about our business and specific positions
and it's better to prevent a potential leak. I have discussed this issue
with Dale and Richard  and  they concurred.

I don't  expect Anjam to act irrationally but it's better to be safe than 
sorry.

Vince

Hi Vince

If you're currently engaged in drawing up contingency plans for the Anjam 
situation, have you arranged for a "snapshot" of his computer directories to 
be taken?  We all tend to use our personal areas (on our H: drives) for 
development, and obviously there'll be a few years of work in Anjam's 
directories.  I wouldn't want him to wipe it all out in a fit of bad temper.  
Although our IT dept. obviously makes backups, I don't know how long they are 
kept for.

Cheers,
Steve
