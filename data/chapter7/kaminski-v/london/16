Karin,

I talked to Mike Roberts (the head of the whole weather team), and he is 
saying that all expenses for Tony should be charged to Global Products Team. 
This is agreed between Vince and Jeff Shankman.
Mike and Vince are negotiating with John to put Stephen (or somebody who will 
replace him) to some other cost centres (via research).

It looks like Kevin Moore is happy if Stephen is charged to the same cost 
centre as Tony.
Let us right now charge Tony and Stephen to the cost centre below .
Please, could we charge them separately - when John and Vince make their 
decision, we should be able to re-charge.

many thanks,

Slava

Stephen , all charges for Soft ware that you use in London
should be charged to the same cost center as Tony Hamilton,
reason being, is that someone will replace you in that position.

                                             Thanks

You can cost it to my group in Houston.  Kevin Moore has the proper number

Hi Karin...

I hope you had a splendid holiday!  I wanted to thank you for getting Tony 
and I set up here last week.  We seem to have established a steady daily 
routine and are supporting several different trading groups in London as well 
as continuing our daily support of traders in Houston.  We've gotten far more 
requests for information than we expected, so as a result I will be remaining 
in London a little longer than originally expected.  As of now - I'm not sure 
exactly when I'll be going back to Houston - but Vince has let me know that I 
will remain here as long as necessary to ensure adequate daily weather 
support for the London traders.  

To that end - I think I will need one additional piece of software installed 
on the machine that I will be using on a regular basis.  Could I please get 
Microsoft FrontPage installed as soon as we can get it?  

That leads to the second issue of desks.  I know that space is a premium here 
- and I understand that I may need to move around some as a result.  I 
certainly want keep things as simple as possible for everyone - but I also 
wanted to make sure that you know that there are certain applications that 
are essential for the daily trader support in London and Houston.  As such, 
if I move, we will need to make sure that these applications are available 
from the beginning of the day (we start about 0600).  The applications are:

1)  Adobe Acrobat - Full Version
2) AccuWeather For Windows - (This is something I will need to install)
3) Microsoft Front Page
4) Terminal Server
5) The full MS Office software package

One idea would be to have a PC move with me - that way we would not need to 
reinstall this software which could cause problems with the daily support 
routine.

Thanks again for all of your help.  I will let you know - once I know - how 
long I will be here.  I should hear something from Vince over the next few 
days giving me an idea.  

Cheers,
Steve
