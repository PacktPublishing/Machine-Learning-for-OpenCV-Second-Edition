Hi Mr. Rao!


Thanks a lot for your mail.

I would be meeting MArk and Mr. Paul Dawson on 1st March and would let you
know the outcome of the meeting.

In the mean time i am enjoying my MBA Program and hope that the outcome  of
the meeting would be positive.


Best Regards


Ajay

Hi Ajay!
     Hope you are doing well. I was wondering if you met with Mark and what
you
guys decided. Let me know either way. If it doesn't work out with Mark, I
will
arrange something else through our research group.
Krishna.
