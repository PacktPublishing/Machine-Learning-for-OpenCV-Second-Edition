Hi guys

I need some advice.

Sharad is in the process of finding differences between your and our versions 
of Exotica.  At some point we will need to migrate London office over to your 
more up-to-date version, and I'm concerned that there may be RAC-style 
implications.  I'm in favour of using the IT testers to carry out formal 
regression testing, and they are apparently able to do this.

Do we need to get our heads together to "form a view" before we involve RAC 
or the business groups?

Anjam tells Sharad that London Exotica was built using Excel 95, and that 
neither he nor Zimin knows how to build/compile the XLA using later versions 
of Excel.  Is this true?  If so, then we need to migrate to XLLs sooner 
rather than later because of the maintenance implications.

Steve
