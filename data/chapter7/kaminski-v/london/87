I understand that you will be in London around 20 September.  Tom Lewthwaite 
has
asked me to arrange a meeting between you, Tom and Julian Leake.  I understand
that you have met Tom and Julian before.   I would also like to attend - I am 
a
manager in our UK Financial Services practice with responsibilty for Enron 
from
a UK financial services perspective.  We would like to discuss any risk
management concerns that you may have and any internal initiatives with which 
we
could assist.

If you are happy to meet, I would be grateful if you could let me know how you
to proceed (whether I should arrange timings with you, your secretary, someone
in London etc).  You can contact me on +44 20 7783 7446 (at Enron's London
offices) or on this e-mail address.

Kind Regards

Paul Day
