Hi Steve & Ben,

We are planning an early Sunday dinner (one of the few evening slots that are 
free in Vince's schedule) at:

Diverso Restaurant
85 Piccadilly 
London W1V 9HD 
Tel: 020 7491 2222 

It's just a few yards to the left of Park Lane hotel on Park Lane, close to 
Hyde Park Corner underground and we've been there before.  Vince would like 
to discuss the latest developments and it seems like the best opportunity to 
do so.  Please let me know if you can make it and I can make sure the table 
is booked accordingly.

Regards,

Anjam
