Vince,

I've been invited to speak at the conference below in Amsterdam in April. 
This is along with the Monte Carlo conference a week later which Stinson has 
forwarded my name for. Both are by EPRM, and shouldn't take too much time to 
prepare as will be on similar topics to the previous conference at which I 
spoke. Should I go to both, or start prioritising these events?

Ben

Dear Ben
RE: EUROPEAN ENERGY 2000, 3 & 4 APRIL, AMSTERDAM

It is with great pleasure that I enclose details of EPRM's 3rd annual 
congress. I would like to invite you to become involved as a speaker on the 
programme and/or on either of the two seminars on Modelling power prices and 
VAR.

The following sessions are currently available on the main programme:
- Trouble shooting roundtables -
        VAR
        Forward curve
        Electricity derivatives
        Heding
- Developing and implementing enterprise wide risk management
- Quantifying and minimising operational risk

Unfortunately this project needs to be signed off before christmas. I would 
therefore appreciate receiving a response from at your earliest convenience.
I hope we can work together on this event and I look forward to hearing from 
you soon.
Kind Regards
Angela Adedeji
