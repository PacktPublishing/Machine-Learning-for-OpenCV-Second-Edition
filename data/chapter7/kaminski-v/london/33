NOTICE OF END OF PROBATION



I am writing to inform you that the six month probationary  period for Sharad 
Agnihotri is due to end on the  21/02/2001.

Please can you let me know as soon as possible if you want to:

 *Pass the probationary period

 *Fail the probationary period**

**In this case you will need to discuss with Human Resources

If the probationary period is passed I will send out a letter to this effect 
for you to sign and pass to your employee.

Thank you

Zoe
