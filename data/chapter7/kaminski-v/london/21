Vince,

There are a few matters I'd like to discuss with you:

clarification on who Tony Harrison reports to ( I had understood it would be 
the Houston crude oil weather forecast team but I am not now sure)
to let you know that Joe wants to recruit a strongly mathematical 
macroeconomist reporting to Steve, and therefore that Maureen will be 
returning to Houston later this month
to talk about Stinson coming over for a visit

Regards,

Tani
