Sophie,

I think it's a fair deal.

Both,

Thanks for your comments and comparisons, it is good to get context.

Based on your comments here would be my proposal

o63,500 basic salary - 
o15K kickers for each of the 2 years - These are paid as a lump sum on each 
anniversary guaranteed.  Therefore guaranteed salary is effectively o78,500 - 
this is completely separate and in addition to any performance bonus
Increase the value of options to o60K  to vest 1/3 as before - which leaves a 
1/3 ($20,000 ) hanging out there at the end of the contract.  

Just FYI - Anjam is currently on o68,000 but does not have an agreement, so 
this would effectively put a 10.5K gap between the two.  

Let me know your thoughts.

Sophie,

Here's Vince's comments on your proposal for Steve.  Also, what's a 2-Yr 
Exec?  How do the kickers work - are they basically a guaranteed minimum 
bonus or incremental bonus?

Dale,

Thanks for your message.
I don't know the labor market  in London that well but here the market
for quants is very hot.  Steve is in my view an exceptionally talented person
and I would go an extra mile to retain  him long-term for the company.

I would adjust the base salary or the kicker upward a bit.
o62,000 Basic  is what Anjam is receiving currently  (if I remember 
correctly). Steve has a much higher value
to Enron than Anjam.
