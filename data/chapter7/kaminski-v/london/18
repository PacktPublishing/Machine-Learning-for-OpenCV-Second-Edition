Annette...

We just wanted to drop you a quick line to thank you for the invitation to 
the UK met presentation today!  Tony and I are currently trying to get a 
grasp of what the traders here require in the way of weather information and 
are building a support structure for them.  As such - we will need to have 
close ties with the UK Met office as well as other data providers.  The 
information presented today was very helpful.

We'd like to take a little time to sit down with you - and/or some of the 
other participants whose markets are weather driven.  We'd like to get a feel 
for what data is already streaming in - and then get an idea as to how we can 
utilize and supplement that data for the Europe markets.  We have a model 
created in Houston to start from - but we want to make sure to tailor to the 
needs of the traders here.

Would you like to take some time to sit down and chat?  Perhaps Tony and I 
can take you and some others out to lunch - or for an afternoon coffee?

Thanks for your help...
