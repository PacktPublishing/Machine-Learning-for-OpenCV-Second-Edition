Hi Wendy:

We have finally made arrangements for Vince's trip in September.  He will
be arriving in London Monday the 18th at 9:55 AM.

He would like to set up a meeting with Paul and Julian sometime on Tuesday,
the 19th.   Just let me know when it is convenient.

Thanks!

Shirley

Hi Shirley

I would be grateful if you could give me some dates and times when Vince will 
be
free to meet with Paul Day and Julian Leake, Tom Leuthwaite is not available 
to
meet unfortunately during the week that Vince is here.

Kind Regards

Wendy
