Steve,

RISK will give you more exposure in the peer group faster.
Shan left (I think they are firing people at RISK - a normal development
for a successful company that got ahead of itself).

If RISK does not work, I shall talk to Phelim about speeding the publicatio=
n.

Hi Vince

The person I was dealing with (Shan Millie) passed on my paper to her=20
successor, and I've heard nothing since.  The plan was to try and publish t=
he=20
article in Risk's "Game Choices" real options book, which is being publishe=
d=20
in June, along with a summary version for the magazine.

I'm supposed to be waiting for them to get back to me, and it's not been at=
=20
the front of my mind until now.  I think I'll chase them up.

Interestingly at a recent Risk course Phelim Boyle expressed an interest in=
=20
my work to appear in one the the journals he edits, I think it's Decision=
=20
Science or something like that.  Do you think this would be a more=20
appropriate home for the work?

One more thing that may be of interest to you is that I've now worked forwa=
rd=20
recursive DP into my notation too.  It's simply a matter of putting the=20
decision nodes on the left hand side of the value symbols!

Should I chase Risk, or pursue the peer reviewed Phelim Boyle option?
Steve

I'd like to give a talk entitled "Diagrammatic Representation of Real Optio=
ns=20
in Enron", in which I will give a brief run-down of a diagrammatic techniqu=
e=20
I have developed for representing real option deals.  My notation allows=20
originators, managers and quants to communicate unambiguously, while still=
=20
appreciating the complexity and subtlety of real optionality.  I have defin=
ed=20
a "diagrammatic grammar" which guarantees that the pricing of the deal=20
follows immediately and automatically from the diagram.

I propose to introduce the symbols and grammar, then go on to present some=
=20
suitable examples of diagrams.  If appropriate I'll talk about the links wi=
th=20
dynamic programming.  (I will need some guidance as to how much technical=
=20
detail I can go into based on the audience.)

All the best,
Steve
