I would very much like to meet Vince, unfortunately I am in back to back
meetings all day today.  Maybe we could rearrange next time Vince is in London
or I am in Houston.

Regards

PAUL

Wendy:

I am so sorry for the late notice, but Vince will be in London for 1 day
only,
Monday, October 2nd.  He has had some time freed up and if Paul and
Julian could meet with him, they can call him at the Grosvenor House,
870-400-8500.  His morning is already full, but lunch, dinner or afternoon
would work.

Regards,

Shirley
