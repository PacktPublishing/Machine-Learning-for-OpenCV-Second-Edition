Tani - are you happy having Steve Leppard and Research reporting to you in 
London, with a thick dotted line to Vince in Houston.  Up to now it has 
reported to Dale, so it makes sense to shift to you.  Steve wants a dotted 
line to commercial, which I'm happy to have to me as he does o much work for 
us.


Richard
