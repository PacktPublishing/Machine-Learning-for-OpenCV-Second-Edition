All

Following discussions between Matt, Vince Kaminski, and me, Matt has decided 
he'd like to make a longer-term commitment to Research.  With this in mind 
we'd like to request that Matt is switched from A&A to the Specialist track.  
Vince and I feel this is clearly in the best interests of Enron given Matt's 
proven strengths in quant analysis.

How do we proceed?

All the best,
Steve
