Hi Vince,

Thank you for offering the opportunity in Houston to me last week.  I guess I 
would interested to discuss it further with you -  one question I have is 
about which commercial groups within the Houston office you were looking for 
additional Research coverage on?  Please let me know when you might be free 
to talk - the best times for me would be from between 12pm and 5pm Houston 
time (I am usually home from 3pm Houston time).

Regards,

Anjam
