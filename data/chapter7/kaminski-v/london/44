Tani,

No problem. We shall look at the curve on Monday. I have organized a  small 
team to examine
the curve from different perspectives.

Curve validation is normally a RAC prerogative and I shall get them involved 
on Monday

Subject: Copper curve

Following Steve's note to you earlier today, I wanted to mention that we have 
a fairly urgent need for review of the copper curve in particular, as there 
is a deal due for final pricing in the next few days.

I am not sure what data you have received from Enron Metals in London, so I 
am asking Tim Poullain-Patterson to ensure that you have the curves and the 
economic justification proposed as soon as possible.  Please direct any 
questions to him or to Harry Tefoglou.  I will be in the Tokyo office next 
week, but available via e-mail.

Thanks in advance for your assistance,

Tani
