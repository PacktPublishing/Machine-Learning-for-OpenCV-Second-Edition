Tim Davies has requested that I contact you regarding Soma Ghosh's PRC mid 
year review.

You will recall that you were asked to do a review for Soma and to date this 
is still outstanding. I would be grateful if you could do this at some stage 
today as our review meeting will be held tomorrow.

Thank you for your assistance

Claire Dunnett
