We are looking forward to having you here.
If you want, you can stop by one day and I shall introduce you
to Grant Masson with whom you will be working this summer.

Hi Dr. Kaminski,

Yesterday, I learned from Shannon Rogers at the associate-analyst program
that I was offered a summer associate/internship position in your group. I
am already very excited about this position and look forward to working in
your group. Many thanks for your consideration.
