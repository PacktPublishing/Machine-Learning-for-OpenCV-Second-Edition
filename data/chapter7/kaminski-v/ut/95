Stinson,

I have received the offer, thank you. I am looking forward to being there
again and getting involved in some interesting projects. I bet it will be
fun.

As to when I can start, I think I can start around the end of May. I can
give you a more precise date after I figure out the schedule regarding my
assistanship obligations.

PS: Could you give some idea about the kind of projects that we'll be
working on? I might do some advance reading if you could point out some
references.

Best regards,

Cantekin
