Ehud,

June 22 works for me. Do you want to firm it up?

Vince,

Many thanks for your e-mail.

>What about June 22?  I have several trips in between May 25 and June 22.
I thank you for the invitation.  May I at this time acquire an "option" to
visit on that date, with the finalization of the visit's timing to be
completed early next month?

Thanks and Best Regards,
Ehud
