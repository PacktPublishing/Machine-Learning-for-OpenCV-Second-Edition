I think he can do it, Vince, but UT has asked him to speak at a Leadership 
conference also on 2/16, which Rick Causey is encouraging him to do.  He has 
all the information (I just sent it home in his mail as he returned this 
afternoon from a week of travel), so will press him to make a decision 
tomorrow.  He may decide to do both or one or the other...I'll let you know 
as soon as I do.  SRS

Sherri,

Any resolution of the scheduling conflict Jeff Skilling had for February the 
22nd?
Our friends at UT are ready to make the reservations and send out invitations
to this conference

Vince

Rick / Vince:

Good morning.

Further to my discussions with Vince during his visit to the Energy Finance
Program yesterday, I write at this time to inquire whether Mr. Skilling's
assistant has been able to confirm his participation as 2/22/2001 keynote
speaker at our Conference.

With thanks for your intercession on our behalf,
Ehud Ronn
