Ehud,

Best holiday wishes to you and your family. 

I owe you an apology for dropping the ball on the conference

I have approached a number of executives at Enron. Greg Whalley speaks in 
London a day
before. Louise Kitchen, the mother  of EnronOnline will ski (this is the week
of school holidays in England and her family will come here). 

One suggestion I want to make is Rick Causey. I talked to him and he is 
willing to
be a speaker. He is a very senior and important executive of Enron and a UT 
grad.

Any thoughts?

Vince

Vince,

At the conclusion of another year, and prior to my departure tomorrow with
my family for our annual Florida vacation, Best Wishes for the Holiday
Period to you and your family.

Regarding the Spring 2001 Energy Finance Conference Participation, we still
lack that all-important 2/22 Enron energy-related high-level keynote
speaker.  Let me know if you think we should look elsewhere.

Best Regards,
Ehud
