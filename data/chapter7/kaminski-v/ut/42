Vince,

Good morning.

As you may know, last Thur. Enron honored this year's recipients of the
Enron MBA Excellence Fund Scholars at a dinner in Austin.  In addition to
the three recipients, Business School Dean May and several of my
colleagues, Enron attendees included Sally Beck, Cindy Justice, Karen
Marshall (newly-appointed coordinator of higher education initiatives for
Enron Community Relations Dept.) and Rick Causey.

I write you at this time to advise you I had occasion to discuss two
current Enron/UT issues with Rick:
I.  Spring 2001 Conference Participation by Jeffrey K. Skilling
II.  UT Participation in EnronTraining Activities
Per my conversation with Rick last Thur., I followed up on that discussion
with an e-mail this morn that touched on those two topics.

I.  With respect to the first, I wrote Rick this morning that:

1.  We at the UT Center for Energy Finance Education and Research (CEFER)
are planning a practitioner-industry Conference in Spring 2001 (late Feb.
or early March) to discuss four topics:  Risk management, Deregulation,
Real options, and International/globalization.
2.  The Conference will kick off with a dinner/keynote address Thur.
evening, then continue all day Fri.
3.  I have had several discussions with you regarding Conference timing,
structure, participation and content.
4.  Further to Rick's agreement to do so during our discussion last Thur.,
in today's e-mail I asked Rick to extend an invitation to Jeff Skilling to
be the keynote speaker at the Thur. evening dinner.

II.  With respect to the second topic, Rick and I also discussed UT
partcipation in Enron Corp. internal training for incoming Enron Corp.
analysts and associates.  Consequently, I e-mailed Rick this morning a
specific set of issues -- "Valuation and Risk Management in Energy Markets"
-- which my UT colleagues and I have covered in public as well as
customized exec ed settings, and which we would be pleased to customize for
presentation at Enron.  FYI, I am enclosing a copy of said topics at the
end of this e-mail.

I look forward to seeing you again soon, and to your UT visit on 10/11.  Best,
Ehud
