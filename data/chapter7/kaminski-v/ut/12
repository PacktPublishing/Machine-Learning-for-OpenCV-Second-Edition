Vince, there was a trustees' meeting (during dinner) which I attended.
Here are a few things that were discussed there:

1. April 4th is the date when different companies representatives will come 
on UT campus to tell MBA
students about their companies and job opportunities. The companies will have 
to pay a small fee (about
$200) to be able to participate.

2. Trustees' continued support for in-class presentations, Finance Challenge 
program and practicums.
I understand that UT wants you to give some classes in the autumn semester 
for MBA students.

3. Some companies (like Reliant) select some well defined projects and give 
them to UT students to
work on for a few months. Students work in teams and discuss their progress 
with Ihud Ron and then
report results to the company.

Regards,

Tanya.
