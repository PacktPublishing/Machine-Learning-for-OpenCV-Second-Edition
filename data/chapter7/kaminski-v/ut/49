Ehud,

We can meet for dinner on the 21st. Then you can visit with us on the 22nd
in the morning and have individual meetings. At 11:30 you can meet the entire 
Research Group at our weekly lunch meeting. We can continue
individual meetings in the afternoon.

Please, make a reservation at Hyatt Regency Downtown or Double Tree
Downtown (there are several hotels with the same names).

Vince

Vince,

>June 22 works for me. Do you want to firm it up?
If it's not too late, I do.

I believe the "game plan" was for me to come in the previous evening.  If
you confirm the date, please advise at your convenience how you see the
6/21 - 6/22 schedule.

Best,
Ehud
