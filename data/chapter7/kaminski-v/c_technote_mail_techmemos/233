Our London group's web page:

 (especially check out the press presentations section; it has a lot of good 
general info)

PDO's

Finally, according to our traders, CME trading activity is down to a couple

I'll try to dig up some specific articles, but I suspect most of them are in 
one way or another CME 
press releases so that they will gloss over the low liquidity.
