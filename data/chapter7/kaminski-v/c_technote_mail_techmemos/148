to your recent publication. Let me find out about Rice seminars and any=20
interest within our group and get back to you.
Regards,

Dear Dr. Krishnarao,
It was nice meeting you at the INFORMS meeting. If it is of interest, you c=

download my recent papers and reports in the area of risk management and=20
financial engineering from
 http://www.iseufl.edu/uryasev/pubs.html#p

Further, I give the list of recent downloadable publications related to the=

risk management and financial engineering.

I am e-mailing to you from Japan. I am for three month at the Center for=20
Research in Advanced Financial Technology, Tokyo Institute of Technology. =
=20
Here in Japan, I am collaborating with my colleges on new classification=20
techniques. Suppose you have some data set (e.g., a data set of financial=
=20
records of companies) and you want to rate the companies based on this (or=
=20
some other information). Linear programming and semi-definite programming=
=20
methods are used for this purpose. With these techniques we are able to=20
calculate credit rating of investment companies (AAA,BBB,=01(). Similar=20
techniques can be used for scoring of credit card applications and other=20
classification problems.

I am interested in applied projects in energy, risk management, and financi=
al=20
engineering area. I will be happy to collaborate with you on this subject. =
I=20
am looking for financial support for PhD students who may work on your=20
applications. Also, I will be interested in to give a presentation at your=
=20
company or at the Rice University, as we discussed.
