I have attached a background piece to brief oil traders on this subject prior 
to a possible meeting with them.

Please give me any comments on 1) accuracy  2) completeness and 3) coverage 
of the areas we want to explore.

As a side note, I found some info on the web stating current proven oil 
reserves are 1,000 billion bbls.  Discovery of a 1 billion bbl field would 
add only 0.1 %.  While we will pursue the trading advantage option, it is not 
looking promising that it has great short term value, given the long time 
frame and high cost of bringing deep water reserves to market.
