Margaret,

Please find attached file with Cinergy prices (last day of the month) 
starting 1998 to date. I have also included daily price for the same period 
just in case you might need it. The source of the data is Megawatt Daily 
Price Survey. Note that prices are given as Common Low and Common High which 
means that data was gathered through representative sample survey.

Please let me know if you need any additional data.

Regards, 
Elena
