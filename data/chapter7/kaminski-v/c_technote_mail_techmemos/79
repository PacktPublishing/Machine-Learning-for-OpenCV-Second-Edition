Dear Generation/Power Marketing Executive:

This Alliance Info Alert includes three items of interest:
1)  The weekly Alliance Express newsletter
2)  Listing of recent filings at FERC
3)  Timeline for FERC action on California Markets  (attached)

INSIDE WASHINGTON  =02=05 FEDERAL AFFAIRS

***FERC De-Federalizes California Markets, Adopts Other Structural Reforms*=
**

At a special meeting Friday afternoon, FERC unanimously approved its eagerl=
y=20
awaited final order reforming the California wholesale markets, adopting th=
e=20
major outlines of its November 1 proposed order and sending back to=20
California the responsibility for addressing state-related matters.  At the=
=20
same time, FERC deferred consideration of retroactive refund issues as well=
=20
as the imposition of region-wide price caps.  FERC reiterated their earlier=
=20
conclusions that under certain circumstances, California ratepayers were=20
subjected to unjust and unreasonable power rates due to California's=20
"seriously flawed" market structure and rules in conjunction with tight=20
demand and supply conditions throughout the West.

FERC adopted the November proposal to eliminate, effective immediately, the=
=20
state's mandatory requirement that the state's investor-owned utilities buy=
=20
and sell electricity through the PX, and allow these utilities to purchase=
=20
electricity through forward contracts and other alternative mechanisms to=
=20
manage supply risks.  FERC terminated the PX's rate schedules effective at=
=20
the close of business on April 30, 2001.  In effect, as Chairman James=20
Hoecker stated, the order de-federalizes 60 percent of the California=20
wholesale market established under the state's restructuring law, returning=
=20
ratemaking authority over company-owned generation to the California Public=
=20
Utilities Commission (CPUC).

The agency also modified the effective period of the $150/MWh "soft cap"=20
proposal, limiting its application through April 2001, whereupon a=20
"comprehensive and systematic monitoring and mitigation program which=20
incorporates appropriate thresholds, screen and mitigation measures" must b=
e=20
in place.  In a related move, FERC ordered a technical conference early nex=
t=20
year to develop such a program by March 1, 2001, so that these measures can=
=20
be place by the May 1, deadline.

***Energy Secretary Issues Order to Power Generators and Marketers To Bolst=
er=20
California's Supplies***

Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has responded to the severely constrained=
=20
power supply situation in California by issuing an order, pursuant to Secti=
on=20
202(c) of the Federal Power Act, to require generators and marketers to mak=
e=20
power available to meet the state's electricity needs.  The emergency=20
directive requires that, if the California independent system operator (ISO=
)=20
certifies that there is an inadequate supply of electricity, certain=20
suppliers would be required to make power available to the ISO if they have=
=20
power available in excess of the amount needed to satisfy service to firm=
=20
customers. Those suppliers that have provided power to the California power=
=20
exchange (PX) and the ISO over the last 30 days that have firm capacity=20
available would be subject to the order.

Under the order, the ISO is required to provide notice to each supplier=20
subject to the order of the amount and type of service requested by 9:00 pm=
=20
EST on the day before the requested service.  The ISO must, to the extent=
=20
feasible, allocate the requests in proportion to the amount of each=20
supplier's available power.  The price for the power provided pursuant to t=
he=20
order will be set by an agreement between the ISO and the supplier.  If no=
=20
agreement is reached, FERC is to determine the just and reasonable rate at =
a=20
later date.   The order will remain in effect until 3:00 am EST on December=
=20
21, 2000 unless modified.

***EPA Sets Plans to Regulate Plants' Mercury Emissions***

EPA Administrator Carol Browner, in a long-awaited announcement, indicated=
=20
last week that the Administration will require reductions of mercury=20
emissions from coal- and oil-fired power plants.  The agency stated that it=
=20
plans to propose new regulations in December 2003, and hopes to finalize ne=
w=20
rules by December 2004.

In the wake of the decision, EEI called on EPA to make certain that any=20
program to control utilities' mercury emissions be based on the best=20
scientific information available in order to assure the protection of publi=
c=20
health.  "EEI urges EPA to maintain its commitment to resolving the key=20
scientific and technological issues," said Paul Bailey, EEI Vice President,=
=20
Environmental Affairs.  Given these uncertainties, EEI is disappointed that=
=20
the regulatory determination includes statements regarding public health=20
threats and hazards that are unsupported by current science," said Mr. Bail=
ey.

"In the meantime, the electric power industry will continue to work with al=
l=20
stakeholders to determine the extent to which additional mercury reductions=
=20
from power plants may be needed, and how those cuts should be achieved," Mr=
.=20
Bailey concluded.

MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS

 ***Calpine Completes Acquisition of EMI Power Assets***

Calpine Corporation has announced that it has completed the acquisition of=
=20
power assets from Energy Management, Inc. (EMI).  In the deal, Calpine=20
acquired the remaining interest in three recently constructed, combined-cyc=
le=20
power generating facilities located in New England, as well as a joint=20
marketing venture between Calpine and EMI.  Prior to the transaction, Calpi=
ne=20
held a 50 percent net interest in the projects.

"We are very pleased to have completed the acquisition of these new and=20
highly efficient power plants.  The Dighton, Tiverton, and Rumford faciliti=
es=20
were among the first merchant power plants to enter commercial operation in=
=20
New England," said Calpine Senior Vice President Bob Alff.  "Combined with=
=20
our other announced project in the Northeast, we have created a coordinated=
=20
system of low-cost assets, with excellent geographic diversity, to provide=
=20
power to a very attractive New England market," added Alff.

***Exelon Completes Acquisition of 49.9 Percent of Sithe***

Exelon Corporation and Sithe Energies have announced the completion of=20
Exelon's acquisition of 49.9 percent of the stock of Sithe.  The completion=
=20
of the acquisition finalizes an agreement in which PECO Energy Company agre=
ed=20
to purchase 49.9 percent of Sithe's assets in North America for $682=20
million.  PECO has since merged with Unicom Corporation to form Exelon=20
Corporation.

Under the terms of the agreement, Exelon has the option to purchase the=20
remaining 50.1 percent of Sithe within two to five years at a price based o=
n=20
prevailing market conditions when the purchase option is exercised.  Exelon=
=20
and Sithe will continue to operate independently, said the companies.

ENERGY DATA

*** Weekly Electric Output (Week 50)***
