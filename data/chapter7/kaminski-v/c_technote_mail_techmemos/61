Jason,

I think what you may be asking for are CalISO power prices.  The CalPX is a
scheduling coordinator and they submit balanced schedules and bid curves to
the CalISO.  The ISO combines the curves from participating SCs (of which I
believe Enron is one) and calculates the uncongested and congested prices. 
The CalISO prices are available from RDI PowerDat, the Enron LIM database, and
a number of other sources.  Recent historical prices are available from the
CalISO web site.

I am copying your mail to Tim Hiezenrader, who runs the Westdesk Fundamentals
group.  I believe he would know how you might be able to access the more
real-time CalISO data that Enron collects.

Tim, can you help Jason out?  He is a manager in the ENA Research Group.

Thanks,
Michael

Michael,

I an trying to locate some historical real-time (spot) power prices for CalPX.
Do you know who may have them?
