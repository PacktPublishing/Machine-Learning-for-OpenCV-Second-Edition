I am working on a report aimed at Energy Marketers that will examine
Natural Gas Storage: Effects on Energy Trading. I am looking for people
who can talk about the importance of this subject to power marketers.
Please contact me if you can inform me on any of the following subjects.

I am interested in exploring the following issues:
1. Storage process: transportation, injection, withdrawal
2. Are all storage facilities connected to pipelines?
3. Description of types of storage facilities: salt caverns,
above-ground tanks, inactive underground volcano, others
4. Problems that limit underground reservoir effectiveness
5. Historical storage data
6. Contributing factors to storage levels: weather, generation demand,
reliability concerns
7. National map of storage facilities and capacities
8. Terms definitions: base gas, working gas, underground storage,
traditional storage, salt caverns, other relevant terms
9. Impact of storage fluctuations on prices and energy trading
10. Safety issues of natural gas storage
11. Seasonal storage trends
12. Total amount of national storage capacity
13.  Future storage capacity needs
14. LNG as storage alternative
15. Technology improvements
16. Who regulated natural gas storage?
17. List of storage facility owners

If you are involved with natural gas storage, or are an energy trader
who is affected by natural gas storage, please contact me by November
13th. Thank you in advance for your help!
