Vince - attached is the most recent E&P version of the old corporate cash 
flow model that I could find.  Note that "most recent" still dates it back a 
few years.  A couple caveats:  I did try to clean it up somewhat from old 
macros, but no guarntees offered.  Also, some of the underlying methodology 
is not what we would probably currently use, such as for pricing, stochastic 
processes, and perhaps decline rates.  
Please let me know if I can provide any additional help.
Mark
