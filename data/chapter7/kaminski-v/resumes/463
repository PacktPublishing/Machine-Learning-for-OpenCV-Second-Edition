Eric,

Thank you for your message. The only other message in my mailbox
from you is dated 6/11/2000 and contains a reference to a resume I cannot
locate. I checked the log of all the messages and could not find any other
communication from you.

Please, send a message with a resume again and we shall go from there.

Vince Kaminski

Dear Mr. Kaminski,

        I sent my resume to your well respected company a few weeks ago
in regards to establishing a long-lasting career with them. I never
received a response and was wondering if you knew who was in charge of
the electric power disbatching/scheduling department or know of who I
may contact to inquire this information? I know you are a very busy
professional and I apologize for the inconvenience.  Thank you for your
valuable time.

Warmest Regards,
Eric Hilton
