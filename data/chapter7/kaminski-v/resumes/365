Dear Dr. Kaminski

My name is Jaesoo Lew and I am referred by Dr. Wayne Lee.

Currently I've been working at Aquila Energy in Kansas City as an pricing
analyst since July 2000.  Since then, I have developed a natural gas storage
valuation model applying the swing options (forest method) pricing approach.
The price processes would be considered critical for the storage valuation
since a trinomial forest is required to value storage. Also the c++
programming using Excel DLL has been developed, too.

I attached my resume to this message for your consideration and am looking
forward to talking about an opportunity at Enron.

My home phone number is 913-649-0578, Dr. Kaminski, I will wait your call in
this week as Dr. Lee informed me.  If possible, please let me know your
expected calling day through the mail.  I appreciate your consideration.

Thank you very much.

Sincerely,

Jaesoo Lew
