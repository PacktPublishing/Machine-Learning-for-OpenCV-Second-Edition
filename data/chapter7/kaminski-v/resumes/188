Dear Mr. Kindall,

I just wanted to let you know that I appreciated the time you gave me on
Monday, and that I am very interested in pursuing a career at Enron. I feel
that my risk management and Treasury experience would prove to be valuable
at your firm, and I would very much like to continue discussions with you if
a suitable position becomes open.

Thanks again for the taking the time to chat with me, and I look forward to
hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,

Bill Anderson
