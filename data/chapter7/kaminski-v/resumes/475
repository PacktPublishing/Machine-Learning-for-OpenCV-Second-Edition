Good Morning,

I enjoyed visiting you yesterday afternoon to discuss the opportunity at
Enron.  Sounds exciting, challenging and a good use of a lot of my skills and
experience.  I look forward to further talks, hopefully this coming week.

I mentioned a couple web sites and don't know if they came through clearly on
the phone with my sore throat.

The neural network approach to timing can be found at

The introductory piece on technical analysis I wrote for Forbes.com and the
glossary can be found at htttp://www.forbes.com/tool/html/00/Jun/0603/feat.htm

I am also working with long time friend and neighbor Steve Nison with his
site and you can see the first on line lesson for free at

Have a nice weekend.  Hope to hear from you next week.
