Shawn,

I have met Bogdan a few times socially. He graduated from the same university
I went to in Poland.

He seems to be a dynamic and a personable guy.
He has experience that may be useful to your group.

Vince

Dear Shawn,
It was a pleasure talking to you today. I will call you upon my return from
Europe. In the meantime we will stay in touch via e-mail.

Enclosed is my curriculum vitae.

Best regards,
