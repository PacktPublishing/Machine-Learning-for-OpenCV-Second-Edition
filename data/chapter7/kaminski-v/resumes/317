Hi again,

I am visiting several family members and friends over the next few days.
Therefore it will be hard to contact me.

However, next week I will be easier to reach.  My contact details in NYC are
as follows. I will be staying at the following hotels:

Washington Square Hotel
from November 28th for 3 nights (Tue, Wed and Thur)
212.777.9515

Marriott NYC Financial
December 1st for 1 night (Fri)
212.385.4900


At any rate, I will still try to reach you on tomorrow morning.  If all
fails, we will try to reach each other next week.

Happy Thanksgiving,
Iris
