Hi again,


     I don't recall if I mentioned that my Harvard Doctoral dissertation
involved another energy problem - the Transient Stability of Electrical
Power Systems.

     Much of the data, model and analysis was done with lots of
collaborative efforts with my advisors at Harvard and MIT and with the
Electrical Power Research Institute (EPRI) in Palo Alto.


Kind regards,
Iris Mack
