I am forwarding the resume of Wendell Licon who works for Enron
in the HR department (executive compensation). He used to be an
FX trader. I am thinking about moving him to research when his current boss
is ready to release him.

I think, however, that you
should take a look at him as well and see if he fits your needs.

Vince
