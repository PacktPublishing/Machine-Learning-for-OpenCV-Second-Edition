    Dear Vince:
 
    I have put together a list of  finance working papers (some of which I brought to the interview last wednesday)  which I have written since 1995 mostly in support of my work but also (at least  initially) as a learning tool. Several of them, however, do contain  innovations.
    
    I have asked Ms. De Claris to  forward a copy to you.
 
    As I expressed to you earlier I  am particularly interested in Enron Credit Swaps trading platform and the  business opportunities that it will spawn.
 
    I also think that there are  tremendous opportunities to be explored in the secondary mortgage maket in the  US. I do not know if Enron has considered or is active in this market. This  would be an area that I am also very interested and in which I think much better  can be done than most of the players in the street.
 
    The question in my mind  (hopefully not prematurely) is: If there is interest here would Enron  consider letting me put together this business?
 
    I look forward to hearing from  you soon.
 
    Best regards
 
    Joao
