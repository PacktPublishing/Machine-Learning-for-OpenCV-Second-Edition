Dr. Kaminski,
thanks for your mail.

I am sorry that I'll not be available earlier,
I will talk with my advisor, but
probably it will be pretty negative.
however, I may be able to start it from June1,
depending on what he tells..
We will meet tomorrow afternoon,
so I'll be able to let you know
whether we can start work earlier then.

And could you tell me briefly
what are those projects you have in mind?

Thanks!
