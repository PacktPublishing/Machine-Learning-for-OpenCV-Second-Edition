Good afternoon Mike:

I certainly am interested in determining if there may be a potential fit
there at Enron.  I am very enthusiastic to apply my finance and meteorology
backgrounds in a market-based environment that is driven to achieve
unprecedented efficiencies.  Attached are two documents:  1) a
business-focused resume, and 2) an abbreviated Meteorology CV.

Graduate Meteorology coursework included Advanced Atmospheric Dynamics I and
II, Advanced Physical Meteorology, Boundary Layer Modeling, Numerical
Modeling, Research Methods in Meteorology, and Turbulence.

I will look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

Greg Hunt
