Vince,

Do you want 3 offers extended or 5?  I just noticed that you plan to fax two 
additional resumes.  If so, when can I expect the additional resumes?

Karen

Vince,

I will handle the offer letters for the candidates.  I have the resumes for 
Darten Williams and Sevil Yaman.  I know you only provided the e-mail memo 
for Paulo Rocha, but I really need his resume in order to capture the 
necessary information for his offer letter.

Please have him e-mail it to me at Karen.Marshall@Enron.com

Thanks,

Karen Marshall
Recruiting Manager
