Dear Shirley,

Thank you so much for your email.  After carefully considering my career
goals, I feel the associate program with a rotation in the Enron
Research Group is a better fit.  I am really interested in Enron and I
would try to contact your colleagues in the Associate Program about this
issue before I schedule an interview with the Enron Research Group.  I
truly apologize for the inconvenience caused and I want to thank you
again for your kind assistance.

Regards,

Kin Tso

 Subject: Interview with the Enron Research Group



 Good morning Kin:

 Your resume was forwarded to the Research Group with Enron North
 America and they would like you to come in for an informal
interview
 sometime next week.  The following dates and times are available
within
 our group.  Please let us know if either of these two dates fit
your
 schedule.

 Monday, November 6th:
 8:00 AM to 11:30 AM

 Friday, November 10th:
 8:00 AM to 11:30 AM

 Since we prefer these interviews to begin at 8:00 AM, it would
probably
 be best if you came the night before, spent the night at a hotel
downtown
 and then were able to be at the Enron Bldg by 8:00 AM.  Please
let me
 know if this is what you would like to do and we will make the
hotel
 reservation.

 I look forward to hearing from you.

 Best regards,

 Shirley Crenshaw
 Administrative Coordinator
 Enron Research Group
