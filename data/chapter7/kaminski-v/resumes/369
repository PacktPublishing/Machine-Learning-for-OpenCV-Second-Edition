Vince/Tanya:

I interviewed Charles today 10:30 AM. Here are my impressions:

 1) Excellent professional and managerial experience. 
 2) Very good technical background. 
  Deal Valuation and
  Model Implementation
 3) Promisses to fit very well into the group's culture. 

The only issues I see is that he would have to leave a high level position at 
his current employee.
