Dear Shirley Crenshaw,

Hi.  This is Yong Cho.  I'm very excited to have the interview offer from
Enron.  Either 5/1 or 5/4 will do.  If I should choose one, I prefer 5/4.
I'm in my office from 10am-6pm(PT).  You can set a time at your convenience
and just let me know.  My number here is 408-541-3502.  I would like to know
how long it will take, and also exact job title I'm interviewing for.  Thank
you very much for your help.

Sincerely,

Yong
