Yes you did and my assistant Felicia Solis is working on the schedule.  She 
will be contacting Bob today to introduce herself and to let him know the

Elizabeth,

We want to bring this guy for a formal interview on Jan 24. Did I send you 
his resume?

Hi, Vince

I haven't yet heard from HR.  Is there someone I should contact so I can
finalize my travel arrangements?

I'm looking forward to the visit.

Thanks, Bob Lee
