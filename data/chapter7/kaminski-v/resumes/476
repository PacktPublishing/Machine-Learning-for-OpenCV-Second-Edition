Dear Mr. Kaminski:

            I recently sent you a copy of my resume and am just
following up to see if it reached you without any problems? I know you
are a very busy professional and I would like to apologize for any
inconvienence I  have caused. I am just very dedicated in trying to
obtain a career with your very well-respected company. I would really
like to put my expereince and education to work for Enron, as well as
establish my life around the company. I am looking for an entry-level
postion if that's what it takes to bulid my life and family Enron
Corporation. Once again Mr. Kaminski, I am deeply apologetic for taking
up any of your time. Any information you could help me with about my
resume would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your valuable time.

Warmest Regards,
Eric Hilton
