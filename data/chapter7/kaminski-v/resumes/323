Dear Mr. Kaminski:

I read with interest your company=01,s description on the
Web page. I was highly impressed by the work that
ENRON Corporation does and would like to inquire about
employment opportunities with your company.

Enclosed is a copy of my resume that details my
academic qualifications and practical experience. I am
excited about stepping into a position, which will
utilize my technical, analytical, and interpersonal
skills in a fast paced environment, and look forward
to expanding my horizons with new challenges and
opportunities that ENRON Corporation   will offer. I
know from customer and supervisor feedback that I have
the interpersonal skills imperative to building a
successful career at the ENRON Corporation and am
motivated to do so. Your firm has an excellent
reputation and I genuinely look forward to becoming a
part of the ENRON Corporation community.

I know you must be busy during this time of the year,
but I would sincerely appreciate a few minutes of your
time. I plan to call you within the next seven days to
discuss how my education, practical skills, and
background would qualify me as a member of your
company. In the meantime, if you need to contact me,
my daytime and nighttime number is (512) 474-6683 and
my e-mail address is knirel@mail.utexas.edu.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration. I
look forward to talking to you.
