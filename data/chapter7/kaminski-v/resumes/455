Subject: Mike Catanese's resume



I am a Ph.D. physicist and have worked for the last five years in
post-doctoral researcher positions in astrophysics.  A few months ago, I
realized that I had reached the limit of my academic career options, at least
for the near future.  After reading about careers in the private sector and
discussing possibilities with some family members and friends, it became
apparent that my technical and mathematical skills could be transferred to
the private sector, with better long-term career options and a more dynamic
workplace environment than in academic research.  The energy industry is
particularly attractive as it begins to deregulate.  I have been directed to
Enron by several different people as a very forward-thinking and growing
company and one which values its employees.

Because of my statistical and mathematical skills, I am interested in a
position as a quantitative analyst.  However, if there are other areas where
the people at Enron think I could contribute, I am open to other options.  My
other experience, such as project management, is outlined in my resume.  I
have worked in a collaboration of 30 astrophysicists from the US, Ireland,
and England and I am a capable independent worker as well.  I have excellent
written and oral communication skills and have made presentations to
audiences ranging from technical experts to school-aged children.

Thank you again for your time and effort in passing this resume on.  I look
forward to talking with you.

Sincerely,

Mike Catanese
