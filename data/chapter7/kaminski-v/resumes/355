Molly,

It's OK (even if the answer is ex post).

Dear Molly,

I asked about change of the departure city.  They said I should send my ticket
back to get a new ticket. Since Aquila provides the ticket, it's hard for me
to change the departing place. If possible, can I ask you to arrange the one
way flight from Houston to Seattle on the evening of 25th?  I'm sorry for
this.

Thank you very much.

Sincerely,

Jaesoo Lew
