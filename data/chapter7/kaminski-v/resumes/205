Hi Vince,
Here are two guys:
The first asked for you (The guy from Oxford).
The second has a "high profile" name-brand risk job.

Candidate 1: Done at Oxford in Sept. Math Finance.
             Will move anywhere necessary.
             Citibank/Andersen consulting background.
             Well known candidate in London.
             Fixed Income/structured contol of 450 mil.
             I have direct ownership and contact with.
             This guy is really impressive by phone!
             Highly recommended by Dr. Donnelly Oxford

Candidate 2: No real Investment Banking/Energy risk experiences...but, asked 
me to get him out in London as he and his wife lived/worked there for FORD 
CREDIT EUROPE. Has operational risk skills and experience! Can probably steal 
him away from Ford (Ford has no agreement with me)...he is fair game.

Thanks for the consideration!
Jeff



ALWAYS HELD IN STRICT CONFIDENCE.
