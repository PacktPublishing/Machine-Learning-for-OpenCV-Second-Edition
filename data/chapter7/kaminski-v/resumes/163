Vince,
     I had two candidates speak with Zamin Lu on 3/14/01 and 3/16/01.
(Renshi Zhang and Bill Koures respectively).  I know you were in London last
week.  If you could please give me some feedback (either positive or
negative) as soon as possible, I would appreciate it.
Regards,

Marshall Brown
