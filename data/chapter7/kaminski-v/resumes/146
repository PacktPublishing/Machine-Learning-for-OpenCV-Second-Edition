Steve,

I submitted my evaluation. General impression was rather
negative: he seems to be a consultant type person
who speaks about everything with confidence  but is short on depth
and technical details.

He is personable, outspoken, organized - on the positive
side.

Also, the red flag is that he jumps from job to job: typical after
18-24 months when any organization can ascertain his usefulness.

Vince

Hi Vince,

what did you think of David Hsu?

My thoughts.

Overall a good guy. Personable. Intelligent.

He could communicate reasonably well, but seemed to be capable of losing 
objectivity in favour of technical advancement.

He didn't seem comfortable with taking a man-management role (at least he 
didn't want to be an 'administrator')

He appeared to know a lot about risk. (In fact Jay Web called me to say he 
felt David was one of the better risk guys he had seen but also commented 
that he needed to be coupled with a project manager to be successfull).

regards

Steve
