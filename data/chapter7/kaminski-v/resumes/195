Dr. Kaminski,

Thank you very much.
Of course, I'll be happy to have an opportunity
to work at such a wonderful company.
I was contacting with Surech Raghavan at Deal Bench team,
and was going to express my appreciation to you again
after settling down process with them.

For the period of working,
I still need to coordinate with my advisor and
may need to adjust according to that.
but anyway, I'll try to coordinate smoothly.

Please let me know whether I should keep contacting
with Deal Bench team,
for working period and
for misc. living support such as finding a place, rent a car, etc.

I appreciate you so much again,
for arranging such meetings and giving me an opportunity.
All this opportunity will not be available to me,
without your kind help.

Warm Regards,
Jinbaek
