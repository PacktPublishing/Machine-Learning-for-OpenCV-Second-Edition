Hi Nina:

We would be glad to see you tomorrow.  Since this is a preliminary
interview to see if there is a fit and an interest, we will schedule an hour
and probably the interviewers will double up their time.

I have scheduled the following, if the times do not work for you, please
let me know.

9:00 AM  Vince Kaminski and Stinson Gibner
9:30 AM  Tanya Tamarchenko and Zimin Lu

When you come into the Enron Bldg, go to the security desk and ask
for me,  They will call me and I will meet you in the lobby of the 19th
floor.

Thanks and have a safe trip.

Regards,

Shirley Crenshaw

Dear Shirley Crenshaw,

Thank you very much for your interest. I will be in
Houston tomorrow morning and I thought that it could
be more convenient if we can meet in person. If you
prefer the phone interview , let me know what number i
should call and we can have it tomorrow.

Thanks again,

Nina Knirel
