Hi Vince,
The following is what I wrote to Molly as she prepares the contract for me to 
work with Enron.
I thank you for allowing me to work with Enron and will do all that I can to 
make you happy with my candiates and performance.
Thank you for you support Vince.
Will check in soon,
Jeff
********************************************************
Sorry about the mix-up on the email Molly.
I hope you get this one.

As most good corporations like Enron have predefined contractual arrangements 
to do Executive Search business I will be happy to abide by your terms and 
rules.
And to be quite honest- Enron is about the "best it gets" so, I prefer to not 
draft a contract this time or for this relationship- I will wait for yours to 
be signed by me.  The only stipulation I request of you is that upon 
contractual performance, Enron Accounts Payable please wire my funds to my 
account as I have a multi-currency account denominated in USD/Canadian or 
British Pounds (which ever fits you as I may need to pay my counterparts in 
the UK)...other than that I have no perplexities.
I will send you my wire instructions later, either my bank in California or 
in Bermuda.
As I live in California and do contingency search, I must go off of my 
client's "good word" on occasion and luckily haven't had any problems so 
far...I always honor California Verbal Contract Law -if I do not draft.
I think you fee payment of 20% is generous and the industry standard of 30 
day guarantee on replacement is fair. Obviously there is no deposit on any 
contingency and if there is a definite urgent need for a position to be 
filled only then will I ask your help for a minor deposit to aid in my 
overhead to shift all my resources to search on behalf on Enron.
As Enron has the in-house power to probably not need this service then 
obviously a deposit will not be required.
If you wish me to send my standard agreement then I will, but you have made 
yourself perfectly clear by phone what you are willing to do. I therefore 
will be happy to receive you contract and follow your instructions.
I thank you and Vince for allowing me to work with Enron and pledge to you my 
best work and candidates utilizing my network of contacts.
I am very excited about our new relationship and hope to give you my very 
best service.
Thank you very much for this opportunity Molly, please send my your contract 
so, that I may sign it and send it right back to you immediately. I am 
looking forward to working with Vince and you.
Thank you again,
Jeff Wesley

Ps- I can utilize to resources of Management recruiters International USA and 
Robert Walters of the UK to aid in my service to you.
Best regards,
Jeff Wesley
