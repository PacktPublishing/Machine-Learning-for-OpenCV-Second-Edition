Vince Kaminski,

I am one of the Stanford students that you interviewed last October.
I really apologize for contacting you that late, but for
some reason when I wrote the email that I transcribe below I did not send
it, and just realized about that until now.

Also, I want to thank you again for opening the
possibility of a summer internship at Enron.

Regards,

Jorge Picazo
