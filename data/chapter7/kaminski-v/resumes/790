I will set-up a phone interview with him to assess his qualifications and 
interest in the HR application support lead position.

Vince, how was it left with the headhunter on how to contact him?

Since I only talk to a very few headhunters that we've already done business 
with and who have provided good people, I'll say "no, I have no current 
needs" which is what I tell every headhunter that calls (at least one a day).

Kathy/Greg/John - Do we need the skills described in the attached resume on 
the project team or in the permanent support group or in the eSupply group?  
There are no personal recommendations associated this resume.
Vince - thanks for keeping us in mind!

Melissa,

Please, take a look at this resume. Any interest?
I got it from a headhunter (I don't know her,
it was a cold call on her part and she did not make a good impression).

Hi there Mr. Kaminski! It was a pleasure to speak with you today. I look

forward to lunch one day soon at Brennans.

Wayne Tow is a brilliant man, He worked for many years for a man I know
well.  This man says, Wayne is as good as it get, and he could do
anything that is assigned to him, and do it at  a level in which he was
always amazed.
He loves the E-commerce area, and this is what he wants to do
Thank you, Vince.
