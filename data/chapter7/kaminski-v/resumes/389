Mr. Yaralov:

I want to apologize to you, I have had the flu and have been out of the
office.  Would you be able to receive the call in the morning (Thursday,
September 28th) at 8:30 AM California time (10:30 AM Houston time)?
We will call you at your home, 213/250-5424.

Please let me know as soon as possible and I will arrange the interview.

Sincerest apologies!

Shirley Crenshaw

Dear Shirley Crenshaw.

Unfortunately I did not get any response on my previous e-mail. I would like
to find out if you want me to set up new time frames for the interview.
Please let me know.

Sincerely,
Georgi Yaralov
