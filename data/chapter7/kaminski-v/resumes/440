Dear:

I would like to express my gratitude to you for giving me an opportunity to
have an interview with Enron.  I have to accept that Enron provides an
excellent working environment.  I am looking forward to hearing good news
from the research group.  If there is anything else that I can do to
accelerate the process, don't hesitate to e-mail me.

Best regards,
Seksan.
