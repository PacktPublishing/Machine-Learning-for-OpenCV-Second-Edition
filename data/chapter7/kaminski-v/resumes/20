Dear Mr. Kaminski,
 
I was one of the participants of the SIAM Conference which was held last week-end, and I have very much enjoyed your presentation. At the end of the session, I was hoping to talk to you, but unfortunately you were already gone. You said that if we were interested, you could e-mail a copy of your talk. I would appreciate if you could send a copy to this e-mail address.
 
I am a mathematics Ph.D. student at Texas A&M University and I will be graduating this August. I am very much interested in working in the modeling of energy markets. Can you please tell me whom I should send my resume, and who I should contact in your company about a possible position in your research group.
 
Thank you for your time.
 
Sincerely
 
G. Aysu Bilgin
