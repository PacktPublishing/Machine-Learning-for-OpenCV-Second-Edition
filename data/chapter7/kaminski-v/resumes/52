Vince,
Jacob has good background in OR and can start working on
pipeline problems right away, if we need someone. 

Maybe it is from his consulting background, I found that at times
he exaggerates a bit about his roles in model building. He would 
start saying he did everything, and later water it down quite a bit.
(What he actually did is not an easy accomplishment though.) 
He also stressed that he wants to move away from pipeline 
projects.

I did not got a chance to ask him any questions about derivatives
and finance. 

Best,
Alex
