Vince,

Thank you very much for the follow up report.  I am sure Richard will be very 
enthusiastic about the opportunity to speak with you and your team.  I

Kristin,

Thanks a lot for the resume.
We shall arrange a phone interview with Richard. This is out standard 
procedure.
A phone interview is  followed by the on-site interview, after we determine 
what is the best team to interview
the candidate.


Vince

Vince,

Last week I was contacted by one of my friends who is very interested in 
becoming an Enron employee.  He has a PHD and several years research and lab 
experience.  

Richard is afraid that being a PHD is a dying breed and may need to go back 
to school to obtain an MBA.  I was wondering if you would mind looking at the 
attached resume to assess if you have any interest in Richard, or if you feel 
I should encourage him to go back to school.  I am unclear as to the 
qualifications for your group so I apologize if this request is way off base.

Thank you for your help,

Kristin Gandy
