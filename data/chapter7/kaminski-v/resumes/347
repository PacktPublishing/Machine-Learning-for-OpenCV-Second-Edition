Hi there,
I am favourably impressed by Martin. I think he's an intelligent person
and understands the power industry. He has good ideas about
modeling various of  things (even though he thinks that 
technical constraints are just technicalities and are easy to deal with).

Please take note that he admitted he does not like to 
write code (he has/had someone else doing it for him).
