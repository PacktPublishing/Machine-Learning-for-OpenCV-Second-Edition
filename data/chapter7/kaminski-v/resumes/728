Vince, Stinson:

I gave a talk to a bunch of UH MBA students taking a course on options.  One 
of the more interesting of the inevitable stream of resumes is the enclosed. 
Perhaps an EBS hire?

Subject: UH lecture and potential career opportunity


Dr. Masson,

I attended your lecture at UH and enjoyed it tremendously.  If possible, I
would like to investigate a career opportunity with your group in particular
or Enron in general.  Would you please review my resume and/or forward to
potentially interested parties?

In tandem will all of Enron's other propaganda efforts, your top-notch
lecture at UH spurred me to do some soul searching.  I currently work at
Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, but have been extremely impressed with
Enron's cutting-edge research and market-leading position.

I have a Ph.D in electrical engineering from Rice (statistical signal
processing) with two years of experience at Duke relating to the valuation,
risk management, and risk measurement of financial derivatives and physical
assets.  I seek a similar position that would allow me to leverage my
quantitative skills and grow within in the corporation.

I believe I would be a great fit with Enron and hope you would consider me
for a potential position.

Best regards,
Matt Crouse
