Rehman,

Thanks for you message.
My group hires almost exclusively people with background in quantitative 
disciplines
(math, physics) or computer programming.

I shall send your resume to some other units in the company that are looking
for people with good skills and experience.

Vince

Vince,
I am a redeployment candidate out of CALME region and in the process of 
exploring opportunities within Enron. I have very extensive background in 
financial analysis and economic structuring. I am interested learning more 
about your group to find out if my skills and abilities could serve the 
present and future needs of your group. Attached is my resume for your 
review, any guidance you could provide would be greatly appreciated.
Regards,
Rehman Sharif
