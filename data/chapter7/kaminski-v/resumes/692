My feedback:

 Philip has an excellent CV and background --- PhD coursework at University 
of Chicago, and work experience at Long Term Capital (hopefully he learned 
something).   His views are somewhat idealistic --- his aim is to make 
bid-offers in any product, and he could not really address how he would 
handle illiquidity.  Nevertheless, if Bryan needs traders, he can fit the 
role.
 Zak seemed somewhat unfocused.  He has worked on a variety of projects, but 
does not have any specific view in mind as to what he would like to do.  He 
seemed very academically oriented, and might be hard to communicate and work 
with.  I do not see him working in the trenches, and I do not see him leading 
the group either.  He would be a good person to brainstorm ideas with.

Rosalinda

I work with Melanie Doyle in London HR.  I have two candidates who I'm trying 
to arrange (for Bryan Seyfried) to come in and see Vince Kaminski however I'm 
finding it difficult to co-ordinate from this end.  Would it be possible for 
you to forward these CV's on to Vince's assistant as I'm not sure who the 
correct person is.

Thanks for your help and if you need more details my number is 44 20 7783 
6945.

Regards
Louise
