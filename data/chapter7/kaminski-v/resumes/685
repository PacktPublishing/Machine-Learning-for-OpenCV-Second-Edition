Hello Ainsley:

We are so glad you are interested!  I spoke with Vince Kaminski and the
procedure is to usually conduct a telephone interview first.  This will let
us know exactly where your interests are and establish where you might
fit within our organization.

Please let me know your availability and the best time to reach you on 
Thursday (the 25th) or Friday (the 26th) afternoon from 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm. 

Also please let me have the telephone number where you may reached
and we will call you.  It is easier that way since there will be several of
us involved in the interview.  The interview will usually last an hour or an
hour and a half.

Thank you Ainsley!

Sincerely,

Shirley Crenshaw
