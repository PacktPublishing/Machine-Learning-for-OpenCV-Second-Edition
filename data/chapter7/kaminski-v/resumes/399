 I want to thank you for giving me this excellent opportunity to meet with
Enron Research Group.  I would be my pleasure to visit with you any time
after 3 PM September 12-15 th.  If this time frame is not suitable for you,
please let me know.  Also, it would be preferable for me to schedule the
interview as late as you can in the afternoon or as early in the morning as
possible.
 As I has already mentioned above, I am very honored by the interest
displayed by Enron Research Group in interviewing me.  I believe your company
displays an excellent example of the well respected leader of the energy
industry.  Enron's overall orientation of staying on the cutting edge of
technology (with such breathtaking projects as e-commerce development) will
make the employment with Enron very interesting, pleasant, and rewarding
experience.  Furthermore, it will provide me with an excellent opportunity to
make the contribution to your company's continuing growth and profit.
