Vince- I spoke with London just now.
Here is what I gather Vuthy said about Howard Haughton.
********************************************************
1. He wants a second-round (another interview with Enron)- but, with high 
officials (Senior Management, this time).

2. He didn't think the interviewers were understanding his technical 
abilities and language.

********************************************************
Good News: He (Howard) wants to come back for another interview. I was lead 
to believe it went well although, Howard believes in protocol.

Bad News: Howard in on vacation now for 10 days.

Sounds fairly good on the candidate debrief.

Thanks, Vince.
