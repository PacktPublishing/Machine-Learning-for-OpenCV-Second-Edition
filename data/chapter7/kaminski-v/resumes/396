I also heard from Joe Toussaint that Ben's boss counter-offered with a bump 
in salary.

Dear Mr. Masson:

Thank you very much for offering me an opportunity to work in your group.
However because of family reasons, I have to regrettably inform you that I
will not be able to make the move at this time. It has been a great
experience working  with you on this process, and I greatly appreciate your
help.

I realized that this would have been a great opportunity for me, and I thank
you very much for everything. I hope you will still consider me for a
position in the future.

Sincerely,
Ben
