Subject:	Hi,

Dr. Kaminski

How are you?
The process for starting summer work is going well,
and there will be no problem we start work
on May 30.
I got a place to live, and reserved a flight.
I'm going to leave for Houston on May 29
(expected time to arrival is around noon)
I am very much excited to have opportunity
to join the project making an exchange platform.

I think it's time I'd better remind you
of scheduling a meeting with me,
sometime on May 30.

I hope you let me know what to to
after I arrive at Houston.
And please let me know if you have anything
you think I prepare, to get better outcome
from the summer work.
If you give me a brief on the work,
it would be a great help for me to decide
which material I should carry from here to Houston.

I look forward to the date we meet,
Warm regards,

Jinbaek
