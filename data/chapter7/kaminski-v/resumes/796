Dear Dr.Kaminski,

it has been a long time since I contacted you so I was wondering if
my resume had been considered for an internship in your group.

I will appreciate it very much if you let me know when I should expect
to learn about a decision on the issue.

Thank you for you time.

Sincerely,

Konstantin.
