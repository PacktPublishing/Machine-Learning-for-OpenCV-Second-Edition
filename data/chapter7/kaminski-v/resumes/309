Good morning Professor Ordonez:

Vince would like to bring Ernesto and Carlos in for a preliminary interview.
Vince and Stinson are available on Tuesday, December 5 or Wednesday,
December 6.  

Should I contact them personally, or will you arrange the interviews?

I will need to know the times they are available on these days and I will also
need copies of their resumes.

If you need any information, please call me at 713/853-5290.

Regards,

Shirley Crenshaw
Administrative Coordinator
Enron Research Group

Dear Vince,

I am sorry for the dely in answering. These are their phone numbers:

Ernesto Hernandez:  (713) 532-0573
Carlos Gorrichategui: (713) 668-0408.

The best way to get a hold of them at this point would be through
me. I would pass along the information and then they can contact you.

Cheers,

Carlos
