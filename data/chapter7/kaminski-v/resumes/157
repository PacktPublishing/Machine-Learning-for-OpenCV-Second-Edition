Hi, Dr. Kaminski:

   I am Zhendong, the student of Dr. Deng. I think Dr. Deng has sent my
resume to you. I am very happy to have an opportunity to work with you
this summer.
   I am a student in both MS qcf and Ph.d EDA programs in Georgia Tech
now. I plan to find a job in industry instead of academic after my
graduation. So I intend to do internship during the process of prusuing my
degree to acquire some experience for my future career.
   I hope to start on 5/14/2001 and end on 8/17/2001.
   Thanks a lot.

Zhendong Xia
