I guess this means "back to the drawing board".  Weijun has decided not to 
interview.

Subject: Please call me

Dear Lance,

Thank you very much for all of your help through this process.

At present, I am really tied up with Mock Market activities in Austin
Energy. It would be inappropriate for me to leave at this time since the
whole project will be jeopardized. Therefore, I decided not coming to
Houston for an interview.  I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this
may cause you.

I do appreciate what you did and hope we can keep in touch in the future.

Thank you again for your help and wish you best.


Sincerely,

Weijun Ji
