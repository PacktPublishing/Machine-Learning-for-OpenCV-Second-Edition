Shirley,

Vince decided to have Rabi De for a formal interview.  Could you co-ordinate 
with HR
to arrange this ? Thanks.

Vince,

We had phone interview with Rabi De.  My impression is good. We should invite 
him for a formal interview.

He is a hands on person with wide range of experience ( energy financing, 
derivatives trading, hedging, etc).
He communicates very well and expressed interest in financial engineering & 
modeling.

Zimin
