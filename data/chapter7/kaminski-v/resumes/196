Vince and Ravi,

Below is a message from the student whose resume I forwarded to you earlier 
this week.  Vince, I suspect he may be best suited for your group, but I 
don't know what your current needs are.  Unfortunately, I'm leaving Enron and 
my last day is Friday of this week, so I won't be around to help this guy 
through the process or host him when he is here.  Can either of you suggest 
someone I can ask to handle this for you if you're interested in him?

Thanks.

Regards,
Laura
