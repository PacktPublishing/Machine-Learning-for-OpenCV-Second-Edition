Shirley, 

We interviewed by phone Karthik and would now like to bring him for a visit 
to Enron.    Can you either arrange it or forward to HR for them to arrange, 
whichever is best.   While here Karthik should probably talk with

Zimin, Paulo, Bob, Vasant, Krishna, Vince
and anyone else Vince wants to add to the list.

thanks,

Stinson

His resume is attached below.   His phone # is  765 494 2181.
