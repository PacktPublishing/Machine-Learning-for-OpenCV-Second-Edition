Dear Vince,

How are you? Well I hope.

I hope you don=01,t mind me writing to you. You may remember that 5 months =
ago
I left Risk Publications and moved to a charity. Having been here for only =
a
few months, I have decided that this job is not for me (I miss the buzz of =
a
corporate office) and I have decided to move back into the corporate sector=
.

Because of my previous experience and knowledge of the energy sector, I am
very interested in moving into this area. I have always thought that it
would be great to work for Enron because it is such a dynamic company and I
am planning to approach the London office to discuss any opportunities,
which might be available. I am particularly interested in product marketing
and research, although I am very open-minded at the moment. I wondered
whether you could recommend the right person to speak to in London.

I know that you are incredibly busy, but any help you can give me would be
fantastic Vince.

Thanks and best regards,


Vicky Windsor
