Good morning:

I am attaching Dr. Valverde's interview schedule for Thursday, February 1.

When he arrives at the Enron Bldg. (1400 Smith Street), go to the
security desk and ask for me.  They will call and I will meet Dr. Valverde
at the elevator on our floor.

We look forward to his visit on Thursday.

Regards,

Shirley Crenshaw
