Hi Molly:

I guess it is time to try and schedule Frank's interview.  We would like to
bring him in sometime around the first of February (when Krishna returns).

Please contact him and see what a good time for him would be.  

Attached is his resume and Interview Request form.

Hello Molly and Cheryl:

Attached is Frank's resume.  We still have quite a bit of time as we want to
schedule this for after Krishna returns on the 25th of January. 

This position would be for the Research Group directly, and would include
all of Vince's direct reports.

Thanks and MERRY CHRISTMAS AND HAPPY NEW YEAR!!
