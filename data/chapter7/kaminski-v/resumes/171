Thanks Dr.Kaminski,
I forgot that :-)
I'll understand it as
I may identify work that I think will be
beneficial to both of us.
Actually,
I have more ideas on the work, beyond the suggestion.
I'll work on it and send it in more formal way again.
(I mean, work list, schedule, deliverables etc)

I'll take steps to get work permit for those two months.
And please tell me know what you can support
and what I should start to do to find a place to stay,
rent a car etc.

Warm regards,
Jinbaek

ps. and thanks for forwarding the message.
