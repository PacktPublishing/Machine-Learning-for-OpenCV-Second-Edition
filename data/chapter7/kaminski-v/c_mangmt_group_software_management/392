Paula:
He should access ECI on our equipment, and the work that he is doing for ENA 
should be provided by them.

Lyn:
Can he bring his current pc with him, or can you provide him with another 
system?

Thanks

Gentlemen:

Stinson Gibner will be joining us at desk location 4415c. I have spoken with 
IT re: a new laptop for him on the ECI lan. He will also need access to his 
ECT (ENA) system. How should we proceed with duplicating his workstation from 
19?

Thank you

Paula
