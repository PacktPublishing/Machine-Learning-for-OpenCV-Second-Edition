Subject: CPLEX

Stinson,
Krishna mentioned that Tom wants to buy (may have bought) Xpress. Tom's 
argument is that Xpress's language allows the user to express special ordered 
sets (certain types of constraints) in a convenient fashion. Chonawee and I 
just talked to two of Cplex's consultants (whom I know personally). They both 
mentioned that these sets are recognized and handled implicitly within Cplex. 
As a result, there is no need for their modeling language to express these 
constraints explicitly.
As a result, I feel that we should go with Cplex. Both Chonawee and Krishna 
seem to have the same impression. I need to get a final vote on this one so 
that we can order the licenses. This has been dragging on for too long.
