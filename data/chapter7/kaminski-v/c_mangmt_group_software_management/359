Yannis,

It makes a lot of sense to get this info.

Also, You are welcome to make a presentation to the group this Thursday at 
lunch.

Please, call Shirley Crenshaw (X3-5290) to coordinate and order sandwich
you would like to have.

Vince


Joe, Can you, please, babysit this presentation (make sure we have all the 
audiovisual
equipment we need, etc.).

Vince

FYI:

The following file describes the contents of the Monthly Energy Review 
(Application, Current, and Historical).
The data is available through a DoE site and we can get it for free and 
incorporate it in the LIM database, if there is interest.

Review the attached file (look for keywords of interest) and let us know 
whether need dictates loading these datasets.
