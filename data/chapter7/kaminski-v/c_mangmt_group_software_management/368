Stinson,

What is SPAV? Is it the basket option model?

Vince and Stinson,

I checked the file and the maintenance that automatically renews on 4/1/2000  
is for the following products:

All 4 of your @GLOBAL licenses
SPAV
SWING

I will go ahead and contact FEA and see about getting the renewal invoice for 
these.  I'll send it to Shirley for payment once I have it.


The products:  @INTEREST, SEAPC, and SEAPP have not been on maintenance for a 
while.  FEA told us a couple of years ago I believe that they do not have 
maintenance available for these products any longer.  So, you don't need to 
worry about cancelling @INTEREST.

Also, just FYI - your @ENERGY.1 and @ENERGY.2 licenses have maintenance 
through 10/20/2000.

If you have any questions, please let me know.  Otherwise, I will proceed 
with contacting FEA about you renewal of the @GLOBAL, SPAV, and SWING 
licenses.

Thanks,
Karla
