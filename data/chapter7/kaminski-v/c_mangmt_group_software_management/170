I agree. Let them make up the data. Please, ask Shirley to determine 
convenient date and time.

Hi all,
I got the following reply from Mike Denton. 

Can you let me know what time is most convenient for you so I will
arrange a time for the presentation?

 I don't think we should provide them any data, unless you think otherwise.

Alex

Mr. Huang,

We would be happy to demonstrate the features and functionality of the
WeatherDelta tool set for your team at Enron.  Early next week (Tuesday or
Wednesday) are both possible, as well as early the following week.  The
demonstration can take 90 minutes or more, depending on the number of
questions and the level of detail.

Ideally, you could provide us with some of your data and we could
demonstrate how to value a full-requirements contract to service that
particular load.  To do this we will need one or more years of hourly
consumption data, and the general location of the load.  Ideal data formats
are csv files of either 365 rows x 25 columns (date,hr1,hr2..) or 8760 rows
x 3 columns (date,hr,load).  In lieu of using your data, we will provide
sample load data.

Please feel free to call me and we can discuss schedules and the particulars
of the product overview and demonstration.

Thank you for your interest,

Michael J. Denton
