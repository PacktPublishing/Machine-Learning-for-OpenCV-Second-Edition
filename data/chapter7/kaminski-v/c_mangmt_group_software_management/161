Vince:

I was writing to confirm the meeting you wanted to set up with me, yourself,
and Mr. Goodpasture for next Tuesday.  I believe it was set for 300 pm this
coming Tuesday at your offices.  (I seem to have misplaced where I wrote the
specific time, so I wanted to be sure to reconfirm.)  Please confirm if you
get a second so that I can finalize my travel schedule.  You can email or
phone 650.218.3069. Thanks.  I look forward to meeting with you again and
with Mr. Goodpasture.

Dale Nesbitt
