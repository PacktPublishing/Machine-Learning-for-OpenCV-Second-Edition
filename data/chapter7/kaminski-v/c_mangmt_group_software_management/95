Debbie,

This is an update on the continuing Winston saga. Tanya
identified the sections of the code that produce inefficiencies
but the rest is in the Winston's hands.

Steve Stock is very cooperative and takes a very rational, Enron-first
approach to the problem. Privately, my concern is that the code, based on 
Tanya's
report to me, leaves a lot to be desired. The code tends to be a very 
mechanical
implementation of the algorithm, developed without a series attempt to 
optimize it.

Let's keep paddling along.

Vince

Tanya,

I just checked in with the contractors here.....and it looks like it might be 
a good idea for you to spend about 30minutes with them to give you a guided 
tour of their documentation.

It's presented as a linked set of word documents and Visio drawing, with 
links to all the reletive parts as hyperlinks. It's pretty good and I imagine 
it will be very usefull to you, but probably requires a little introduction 
first.

Please feel free to come to my office whenever it is convenient. Even if I'm 
not available, the guys are just outside my office and I can easily stop 
whatever I'm doing to introduce you to the project manager.

regards

Steve

Steve,
- we spent about 5 fruitful hours with Winston last week.
- I pretty much understand the data flow when the code runs.
- I also got an idea where the time is spent during the execution of the code 
by questioning Winston.
I did not see any results of profiling the code. Winston's opinion is (as I 
understood) that he knows how much time is spent 
on different calculations and profiling is not easy to do, so we don't need 
to do it. 
- Based on above I suggested possible way to reduce the time credit model 
takes to run and we discussed it with Debbie, who was
going to arrange a meeting with Winston.
- It might be useful to look at the Documentation created by contractors, if 
you have it handy - send it to me, please.

Thank you,

Tanya.

Tanya,

how's it going with code-review from your perspective?

...did you manage to talk to our Documentation contractors?

...if not, would you me to arrange for them to bring you the documentation as 
it currently stands?

regards

Steve
