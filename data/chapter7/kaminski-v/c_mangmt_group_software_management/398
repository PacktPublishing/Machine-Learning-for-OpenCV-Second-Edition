Hello Lyn ,
How are you? Certainly hope you enjoyed the holidays.
I HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE COLOR PRINTER AS OF YET.
Could you please provide me with information concerning this.

                                                              Thanks
                                                           Kevin Moore
