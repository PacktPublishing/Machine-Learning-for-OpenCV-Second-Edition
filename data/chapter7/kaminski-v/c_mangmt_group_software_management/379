Kevin,

Please see the following websites for features and specifications of the 
color copiers currently available to Enron and pricing is on an attacment @ 
the bottom of the mesage. Let me know if you would like to meet with any of 
the Reps or if Vince/Mike/Shirley or yourself would want to take a trip to 
the vendor location for demonstrations on any of the equipment listed below.

These color copiers are only supported by the Vendor and the lease would be 
between your group and the relative Vendor. Response times have been 
specified as 4 hr from the time the call is placed to the Vendor Tech 
arriving during normal business hours. After hours service is available @ 
premium rates, yet to be quoted = Let me know if you require this after hours 
service pricing.

EPSC Key-Op does not currently support color copier equipment and as such, 
someone in your group would receive the necessary training for low level 
maintenance {Jams/Toner/Staples etc}. You would also need to store the 
necessary supplies for the selected Color Copier.
