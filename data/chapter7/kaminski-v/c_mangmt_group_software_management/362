This weekend, the Enron Global Information Technologies department will be 
distributing a new version of the Oracle 8i client.  Due to the mobile 
environment of our user base, not all machines will receive the automatic 
update.  If you are a user of an Oracle based application and your machine is 
not available to the network this weekend, you can manually upgrade your 
machine via the following steps:  

 1) Click on Start - Programs - Utilities 
 2) Then  click on "Install Oracle 8i Client".


If you are a user of Microsoft Excel spreadsheets or Microsoft Access 
databases that retrieve information from our Oracle databases, you can 
manually convert your Oracle ODBC connections to the proper drivers via the 
following steps:  

 1) Click on Start - Programs - Utilities
 2) Then  click on "Update ODBC Data Source Names to Oracle 8i".


If you do not see these icons, there is another icon under Start - Programs - 
Utilities called "Update Start Menu" that will re-populate your Start Menu.


Thank you for your co-operation -
Scott Williamson
Director, Database Infrastructure
