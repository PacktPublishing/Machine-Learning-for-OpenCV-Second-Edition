**Swing users: @ENERGY/Swing now replaces the "SWING" product. See the
@ENERGY user manual for a discussion of the changes. Contact FEA for the
necessary license keys. You will be able to run both the new and old SWING
simultaneously.

Heres an overview of the new and changed features since version 1.6:


@ENERGY (Forward Curve)
Jump parameters are now calibrated for use in other @ENERGY functions.
Inputs and outputs to POWERCALIB and COMCALIB have changed. See the
corresponding function syntax in the User Guide for additional information.
35-40% speed improvement. The module is now out of beta.

@ENERGY (Basics)
Different interpolation schemes on forward prices are now supported. If you
use INDEXSWAP , EXOTICSWAP, or OPTINDEXSWAP with floating price linked to a
series of futures dates, such futures dates need not be close to dates
specified in the forward curve input.  A new utility function, PATHUTIL,
allows you  to simulate and visualize price paths consistent with the models
supported by @ENERGY. 25-30% speed improvement.

@ENERGY (Advanced)
Different interpolation schemes on forward prices are now supported. If you
use OPTDIFFSWAP or DIFFSWAP  with floating price linked to a series of
futures dates, such futures dates need not be close to dates specified in
the forward curve input. CALSPREADOPT now allows for the specification of
two different mean reversion rates. 30-35% speed improvement.

@ENERGY (Swing)
SWINGOPT and STRIPSWINGOPT now allow for valuation of swing straddle
contracts with overall load constraints. 65-70% speed improvement. The
module is now out of beta.

@ENERGY (Weather)
30-35% speed improvement.
