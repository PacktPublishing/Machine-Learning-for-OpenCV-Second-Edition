Hi Kevin,

Brian Wood with Avistar is going to be here next Tuesday (11/14). I have 
asked him to schedule some time to meet with you and Vince, and whomever else 
needs to be trained. I was not aware that you would be using the media 
server, so I didn't arrange to have him spend any time with you when he was 
here alst. I'll let you kow what time(s) he'll be available next Tuesday. 
Sorry for the delay

Ian -- please ensure that Vince Kaminski is set up to use the media server

Thanks!

Paige
