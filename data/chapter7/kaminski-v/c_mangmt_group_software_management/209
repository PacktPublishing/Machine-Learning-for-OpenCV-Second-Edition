Elena,

The new research web page looks very nice.   

Recently I have a few users who called me about the links to exotica options 
library.
I checked, both links to Exotica.doc and example spreadsheets do not work.

I appreciate that if you could re-establish the links as soon as possible.

Thanks.

Zimin
