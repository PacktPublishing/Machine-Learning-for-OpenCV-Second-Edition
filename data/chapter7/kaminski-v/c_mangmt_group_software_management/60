Friends:

I spoken with most of you over the last few weeks regarding the new
version of AURORA due to be released tomorrow.  We've broken a lot of
new ground with this version, and  this version will serve as our
official launch into the Eastern U.S.  We've worked closely with our
Eastern customers, and responded to the needs of the market.  Some of
the enhancements:

AURORA SOFTWARE MODELING ENHANCEMENTS:
* Energy Storage-Resources (Pumped hydro)
* Market Areas: no limit on number of areas
* Transmission: congestion pricing.
* Price Caps
* Risk Analysis
* Modeling Enhancements via VB Scripting: "Update Data" capability

GENERAL CAPABILITIES
* AURORA's run time speed improved again.
* File transfers to EPIS
* Interface Enhancements

REPORTING ENHANCEMENTS
* Marginal Resource reporting
* Resource operations reporting
* Resource stacks detail consolidated

AURORA DATABASES
* East-Central AURORA Database -- 25 market areas modeled with 11
market areas in New York ISO.
* WSCC AURORA Database -- updated IPP resources
* ERCOT AURORA Database - updated resources
* All databases updated to use the new modeling capabilities


As AURORA continues to grow, and we meet the needs of the market, we
have made several procedural changes.  We continue to offer free 7-day
demos to those companies that want to take a look at the model, and get
a brief idea of how it thinks and feels.  After that 7-day demo period
we now offer either a discount for moving into a full license, or we
offer a 60-day trial for $10,000.00  --We also now offer more options
for the licensing of the model.  Annual Licenses are priced as follows:

Single User (1 User / 1 PC)
$33,000.00
Limited-Use (1 User / Multiple PCs  OR  Multiple Users / 1 PC)
$45,000.00
Two-User (2 Users / 2 PCs)
$55,000.00
Site License (Unlimited Users/PCs excluding Affiliates)
$79,000.00
Affiliate-Site (Unlimited Users/PCs including Affiliates)
$99,000.00



For additional information, please contact me, and I'll speak with you
about how AURORA can help you in your specific operations and projects.
