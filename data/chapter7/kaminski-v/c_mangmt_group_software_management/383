Timothy:

I still have a problem.   When I am on the ECI network I cannot receive 
email, and, even worse,  I cannot even send email.     This is not an 
acceptable situation.   I need to have a fully functional email account on 
the ECI side as well as the ENA side.    Don't tell me that its against 
policy because I know that Ravi Thuraisingham has already be set up this way 
for months.    I don't care if mail from one network is forwarded to the 
other as I will have access in Houston to both, but I can already see that I 
need to have functional accounts on both sides, or it will be a continual 
thorn in my side when travelling to Portland, etc...

Again thanks for your help on getting this set up correctly,

Thanks Stinson,
That should give me what I need.
I understand that you will have two Notes ID's with the ECI mail forwarded to 
your "Stinson Gibner/HOU/ECT@ECT@ENRON" address.
I should be able to complete this today (later today)

Thanks,

I  must have written down your phone number incorrectly,  it did not work.

Regarding my user ID on the ECI network,  I would be set up in the same way 
as Ravi Thuraisingham with an ID on both the ENA and the ECI networks.   I am 
in the Corp. research group but am spending about 80% of my time in support 
of ECI in the trading and origination areas.

Feel free to contact me if you need any further info.
