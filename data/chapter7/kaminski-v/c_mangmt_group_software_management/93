Mike,

Following request has been made for a number of people.

The access requested is: o:\research\power meteorology\weather temperatures - 
Read/Write
 Data Approval  Grant  

This is what I wrote, denying the request:

The reason for the rejection has been communicated  several times.
The person who requested the access does not want it any more.  Granting both 
read/write access could threaten the integrity of the data.


Any comments?

Vince
