Goodmorning Vince,
This is a very much needed fax machine.
Mike gave approval for the new fax machine, also I spoke with Shirley 
concerning this matter.
We have some new clients that requires faxes with long distance locations
and the new fax machine will ensure that it reaches them in record time.

                                                       Thanks
                                                   Kevin Moore
                                                        FYI

Kevin,

Per your request, please see below:

******************************************************************************
***************************************
New Facsimile Machine Information

Please take a look @ the following and let me know, which FAX machine you 
choose or if you need information on something smaller, then I will have the 
Vendor contact you directly to finalise installation.  An Enron Director or 
above {With Signature Authority to legally bind Enron to a contract} will 
have to sign off on the contract paperwork before the fax machine can be 
installed. Delivery times on new machines are normally 3-5 working days but 
either Vendor listed below will be able to provide a "Loaner" should you have 
a business need. Please discuss the Fax Machine Install Date with the Rep 
when ordering the equipment.

If there is no existing fax line present, you will need to send a Notes-Mail 
to the Move Team {Erica @ x3-3185 or Janelle @ x5-7917} requesting the 
installation of a new fax line. The Move Team can be found in the Notes-Mail 
"ECT Address Book".

If you are an EES employee, you must first get new equipment approval from 
EES Budget Control. Contact Susan McLeroy @ x5-8066 or via Notes-Mail.

If you are an EBS employee, you must first get new equipment approval from 
EBS Purchasing & Budget Control. Contact Paula Corey @ x3-9948 or Martha 
Reyna @ x3-3491. You can reach both of these people via Notes-Mail.

If you are an ENA employee, you must first get new equipment approval from 
ENA Finance & Budget Control. Contact Lorie Belsha @ x3-9617 or via 
Notes-Mail.


A note on the fax machines listed below:
All the machines listed below come with a 2nd paper tray and Upgraded memory 
{Maxed by model~See Below} as an Enron Standard from each Vendor.
All the fax machines listed below have a modem speed rated @ 33.6 Kbps versus 
the Canon LaserClass 7500 {Example only} @ 14.4 Kbps = New fax machine should 
be noticeably quicker.
Document feeder capacity of the machines listed below are the same as the 
Canon LaserClass 7500             {Example only}
Maintenance = Models listed below have Maintenance/Repair coverage included 
in monthly $ total. There is NO separate agreement! Toner/Drum cartridges + 
paper + line charges are extra {Not quoted}

Contract pricing can change without warning, so please let me know ASAP if a 
Vendor quotes you a different price to those listed below against the various 
models.

If the fax machine is to be used in a trading type environment, here are some 
considerations:
No more than 20 people per fax machine = Take a look @ the fax machine 
placement on EB30 or EB31.
Disregard any fax machine that does not have a 33.6K Modem and JBIG 
compression {or equivalent}.
Look for memory upgrades & 2nd paper tray included in monthly cost. {Models 
quoted are loaded}.
Maintenance is to be INCLUDED in Monthly Cost {Models quoted are covered}.

The above machines are designed for workgroup use.
Q) How many people will be using this fax machine?
Q) How much usage will this fax machine have? 
{i.e. Heavy = 40 faxes per day @ 20 pages/60 faxes per day @ 2-3 pages or a 
lot less? If "HEAVY", either the PB2050, PB9930 or  UF885/UF895 should fit 
your needs = If 15-40, the PB9830 would probably be a better fit}

and the relevant Vendor, as follows:

The Facsimile Machine Agreement is between the Enron Business Unit/Department

The User or Requester of the Fax machine is responsible for invoice payment.

Enron Property & Services Corporation is NOT responsible for the coding, 
processing or payment of Facsimile {FAX} machine invoices.

In order to return any old fax machine equipment, you must contact the 
leasing company that supplied the equipment and send them a certified letter 
that terminates the agreement. If you terminate a contract within the 
original agreement period, you may be liable for penalty charges as a lot of 
Fax Machines are on a non-cancellable lease agreement. The Vendor who 
supplied the fax equipment will be able to let you know of any outstanding $ 
amounts for your existing equipment. 

If you are asked to pay outstanding $ amounts, be aware that some Vendors 
include the cost of outright PURCHASE of the old fax equipment = From the 
contracts I have reviewed so far, you are under NO obligation to purchase the 
old equipment.
