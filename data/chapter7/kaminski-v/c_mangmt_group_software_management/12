Hi Stinson,
 
Thanks for meeting with us on  Thursday.  We enjoyed
talking with you.
 
As per our discussion, I have attached  the course 
outline of Java for Managers along with this  email.
After our conversation with you we think this  course 
may be a  little bit heavy for your group.  But we can definetly
take it down to concepts level and make it  appropriate for
our audience.  Please review and let me know,  if this 
course would be of value to you.  This is a 3 day course 
and costs $11,000 (maximum of 15  students).
 
Regards,
