The Expense Management System (XMS) is a tool used to electronically submit=
=20
your expense report for approval and payment through the Enron Intranet. It=
=20
is user friendly, accurate and less labor intensive for you and our=20
accounting staff. This product was initially made available October 15, 200=
0=20
and approximately 50% of the Houston employees are currently using it to=20
submit their expense reports.  Our goal is to have all Enron employees usin=
g=20
the XMS system by April 15 (income tax day=01*easy to remember).  =20

There are some changes coming to the Accounts Payable (AP) Department that=

are compelling us to fully utilize the XMS system.  In the near future pape=
