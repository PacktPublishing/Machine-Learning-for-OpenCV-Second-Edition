The system will not allow me to view this request, saying that it has been 
assigned to you.    I have left a message with the admin who originated these 
requests.   If I don't hear back from her today,  I think we should just deny 
all of them.   I earlier sent emails to the individuals named asking what 
data they needed to access and NONE of them responded.
