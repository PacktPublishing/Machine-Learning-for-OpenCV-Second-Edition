Siva,     I will have to check and see if we can accomodate a 5 day 8 to 5 
class.    Also, President's day is a holiday for us, so we may have to look 
at a later date.

Stinson,

I have attached a file along with this email
that lists the software needed for our
Java class.

We would like to do the class from Monday thru
Friday, 8 AM to 5 PM.  That way we can complete
the class within a  week.  We are unable to offer
classes in the evenings or for few hours a week.
We usually teach week long courses for our
other clients and because of that  we won't
be available.

Currently, we can do the class from Feb. 19th
through Feb. 23 (that is if you are working on
Feb 19th, President's day).

I will call  you sometime this afternoon to talk
further.  Please feel free to reach me if you have
any further questions in the mean time.

Regards,

- Siva
