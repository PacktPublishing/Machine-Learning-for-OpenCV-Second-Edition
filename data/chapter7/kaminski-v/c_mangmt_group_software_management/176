You're welcome.

I have Vince on the list now. We are installing this week and over next 
weekend. We'll have to go to the location to see if we'll have to pull 
additional cable to Vince's desk. I wouldn't look for it to be in before next 
Monday.

With regards to the billing -- I will have Stella Ely get with you on that.

Thank you for all of the info

Paige

I really appreciate you speaking with Gary regarding
the Avistar System. 
Please inform me on what I need to do to make the process
continue.

The location for the Avistar is EB3240D.
 The location belongs to Vince Kaminski.

If you need more information please call x34710.
If possible, would you please inform me as when to
expect the system connection date and time.
