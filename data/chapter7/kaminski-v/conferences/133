Vince - Thanks for the update.  I've been pulled into a 7:00 am breakfast
which I must attend.  Chances are I could catch up with everyone between
8:00 and 8:15.  I apologize, but  two of my breakfast dates are taking
special flights in just for the breakfast - or I wouldn't inconvenience
everyone.
