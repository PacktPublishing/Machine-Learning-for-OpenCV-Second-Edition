Dear Shirley
?
Further to our telephone conversation earlier  today, I am writing concerning 
the GARP 2001 Convention, which will be held in  New York between 13th and 
14th February.
?
I have set a new deadline for presentations to be  sent to me, which is 
Friday 5th January. I am sure you can appreciate that  collating, arranging, 
organising and printing over 80 presentations is a mammoth  logistical task, 
hence why I require the presentations as soon as  possible.
?
Can I please have an indication of when I am likely  to receive Vince's 
presentation? Below is the talk he has agreed to give (he has  also agreed to 
chair the stream on Energy & Corporate Risk on Tuesday 13th  February):
?
Measuring Energy Risk -  Tackling Price Volatility, Adapting VaR, Scenario 
Modeling and Regulatory  Requirements
- mean (or floor)  reversion
