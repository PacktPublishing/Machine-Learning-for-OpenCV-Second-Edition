Shijie,

Additional   changes.

Abstract:

The power market developments in the US have created several unique
challenges for energy industry economists. We discuss the major factors 
underlying
the exceptionally high volatility of electricity prices. We feel that some of
them may reflect the flaws in power pools design and incomplete transition to 
fully deregulated markets in
generation and transmission.


The title is fine.

Vince

Vince,

Thanks for the abstract!  For the purpose of the conference program
listing, the conference organizers need a title and an abstract which is
longer than 50 words.  Based on the abstract that you sent me, I took the
liberty to make up a title and the 50-word abstract (attached below).
Please make changes as you feel necessary and send them back to me.  I'll
send them out to the organizers once I get your confirmation on this.

Best,

Shijie

Title: Current Challenges in Modeling Power Price Volatility

Author: Dr. Vince Kaminski, Head of Quantitative Research, Enron Capital &
Trade Resources

Abstract:
The power market developments in the US have created several unique
challenges for energy industry economists. We discuss the major factors 
underlying
the exceptionally high volatility of electricity prices. We feel that some of
them may be a necessary price to pay for increased market efficiency and
expanded customer choice.
