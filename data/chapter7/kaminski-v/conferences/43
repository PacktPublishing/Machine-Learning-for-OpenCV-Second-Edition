Subject:  Invitation to the 20th Annual Rutgers Conference


Vince:

For two decades now, I have been a member of the faculty helping to
organize the Eastern Conferences on Regulation and Competition that Michael
Crew of Rutgers has chaired.  This year will be, in fact, the 20th
anniversary conference and a number of notable personages will be joining
us to celebrate what we have learned and what we haven't about the
economics of network industries.  Fred Kahn, Al Philipps, Bill Hogan and a
number of other distinguished academics will be reviewing our progress and
the prospects for the future.  The conference will take place at a
beautiful site in the Poconos, about 90 minutes north of Philadelphia, from
Wednesday afternoon May 24th to Friday afternoon May 26th.  You can check
for yourself the nature of the program and the conference site/hotel at the
following website URL:

http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~crri/WS.htm

Michael Crew and I would both be delighted if you would be willing to be an
after dinner speaker on Thursday evening (May 25th), just before the key
research reviews of Friday morning take place on the electricity, telephone
and gas industries, and following a day of special topics on emerging power
markets and other developments in network industries.   Naturally we would
be pleased if you would be able to stay for the entire conference, but
knowing your schedule, you may only have time for a part of it.  That would
not be a problem.  The usual after-dinner address is for 30 minutes,
followed by a short Q&A period.

Your presentation would help to underline the tremendous importance of
Enron in driving the development of new risk instruments to assist in price
discovery and efficient risk management for market participants, in energy
markets and more generally.  Both Michael and I feel that your perspectives
on the "new science of risk management" and what can be expected from it
could be a very important addition to this special anniversay event.

Please let me know (and please do copy Michael on your response) whether
your schedule will allow your participation in this very special event.
Michael and I would, of course, be very happy to follow up with you in
discussing the nature of the presentation, participants and so forth, if
this is a go.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Regards,

Paul
