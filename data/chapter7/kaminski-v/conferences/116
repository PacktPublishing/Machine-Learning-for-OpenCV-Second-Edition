Dear Dr. Kaminski,
Thanks for your email address. Would like to invite you or others from Enron

art assessment of ancillary services markets, hear preliminary research on
related topics, and help define a course of research that EPRI could
undertake.

Here is one of our announcements. Pls feel free to call with any questions.
