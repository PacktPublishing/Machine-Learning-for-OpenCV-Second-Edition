Hello Ron and Jean:

Please furnish me your Co# and CC# so that I can make a group reservation
to the "New Texas Electric Market" seminar in Austin on May 2nd.

I will charge the entire amount to Vince Kaminski's credit card, but we will
need to cross charge the charges when we submit his expense report.

Thanks!

Shirley,

I think that we will only have 1 or 2 people outside of research to attend.
