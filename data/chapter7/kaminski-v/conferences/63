Dear Vince,

I would like to confirm the invitation for you to participate at our annual  
congress in Houston. Following our conversation, I would be most interested 
in  including a presentation on 'Modeling price volatility in US power  
markets'  in the pricing, hedging & trading stream on the 14th May,  2001.

I am keen to confirm each speaker and session by the end of next week, which  
will then allow time to work with each presenter on titles and points that 
will  provide an accurate summary for the session.

If you have any overall views or suggestions regarding the conference feel  
free to email me at pbristow@riskwaters.com or call me on  212 925 6990, 
extn. 225. I look forward to confirming your participation at  Energy & Power 
Risk Management 2001. IMPORTANT: Due to system problems I am  using another 
system. Please do not reply to this email. Please reply to the  address given 
above.

Yours sincerely,

Paul Bristow
