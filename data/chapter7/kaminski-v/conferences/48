Vince,

 I've distributed the info on the course. Gary Taylor, the head of marketing 
said that there were perhaps two people he'd like to send, and he thought 
that the teachers would be able to benefit from having people from the 
weather derivatives desk in attendance, but that the price of $1100 a person 
was too steep. Gary (being the head of marketing that he is) would like to 
see if there would be some special deal that could be arranged for people 
from the weather desk, but he doesn't want to cross the line.

Joe

Joe,

This is the most recent offer from Lacima
(weather derivatives course). What do you think?

Vince,
Enron is fine (although I think we have to pay for the Hyatt anyway).
 
Good discount (I have a feeling that my idea of a good discount and the  
weather desk's idea is probably different?):  for the one day, $1100 per  
person.  If you think that there will be around 10 people or more,  then we 
can offer a day rate, regardless of the number of people.  
 
Thanks Vince
 
Julie
 
PS - Of course when I announced that we were cancelling, people started  
responding that they wished to attend.  Ugh!

Julie,

Enron location makes more sense. No reason to  pay for the hotel.
Also, I think that one day makes more sense.

I  contacted the weather desk about including other people at the  training
course. I think that they would be interested if they got a good  discount.

Vince,

Great. Just to let you know,  we decided not to wait on the indecisive
ones, and postponed the open  course. It's yours, whatever you want:   1
day (specific to what you  feel will be of the most benefit), 2 days, Hyatt
or  Enron, or not at  all. I hope this doesn't cause problems for you.
Special deal, for sure. I  owe my godfather.

Julie

Julie,

That's definitely an option.

We  can  provide the room. Maybe we can cut with you a special deal  for
Enron
and  increase the # of people attending. I am forwarding  your message to
our  weather  desk.

Vince

Joe,

What do you think about   it?

Vince

Vince,

We just wanted to let you  know  that we only have 3 people signed up for
the
weather  derivatives course  (all from Enron) so far. We have a couple  more
that have expressed strong  interest, but we are awaiting their  final
decision. If no one else signs  up, Chris and Les thought that  you guys
could probably get through the  first day pretty easily, and  thus thought
it
may be an option to teach just  the 2nd day  material (pricing) only at
Enron
(doing it at the Hyatt is an   option as well but the room might be on the
large side)? We would   obviously reimburse you for the day not taught. We
can teach both days  as  well, but thought you may want to save some time.

I just  wanted to give  you some time to think about it. We will know where
we  stand on final  numbers by next   Wednesday.

Julie
