Good morning Amy:

An LCD Projector to hook up to a lap tap for his presentation
He will have dinner with the conference organizers and speakers on the 29th.

Ms. Crenshaw,

Thank you for sending the bio so quickly.  It's exactly what I was looking
for.

We are planning to compile the conference speakers' papers for distribution
to the participants.  While I will not need Dr. Kaminski's contribution for
several weeks, an abstract of his presentation as soon as possible would be
very useful to the conference organizers.

I will also need the following information:

- Dr. Kaminski's audio/video equipment requirements for his presentation
- will he be joining the conference organizers and speakers for dinner on
May 29?
- which nights will he be staying in Toronto?  I will reserve a room at the
conference hotel
- any dietary restrictions or special requests

Your help is much appreciated.

Best wishes,

Amy
