I shall be glad to meet you. I am planning to attend the Energy Symposium

feel free to contact me at 713 853 3848 and we can schedule a meeting during 
the day 
or in the evening.

Vince,

I hope things are well with you and your family.

The reason for contacting you today is to let you know I will be in Houston 
next
week between Monday and Wednesday inclusive.  If there is an opportunity to 
meet
up, probably informally, it would be useful to discuss our continuing 
activities
in the areas of Strategy, Value and, increasingly, Real Options.

If you are attending our Energy Symposium, or can meet up, please contact me 
at
your convenience.  If we do meet, I would also like to introduce you to one of
our senior managers from Houston:  George E. Danner.  George is a member of 
our
US National Strategy team and part of our global network of specialists 
working
on real option pricing.

If I do not speak to you before tomorrow - happy Thanksgiving.

ALLAN
