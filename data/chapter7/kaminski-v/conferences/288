Hi Vince,

 I am resending you this request by Dr. Jacque for a paper.  They are 
expecting something by Jan 22.  Should we sit down and decide on what to put 
in a short paper (I think their limit was 30 pages, but that is impossible -- 
I think a few pages should suffice).  

Regards, and happy new year,
 Vasant

Dear Dr. Shanboghe:

 I certainly understand that it would be difficult for you to
contribute a chapter. I thought of an alternative: would Dr. Kaminski be
willing to allow us to reprint his article (in an abridged form) on "Energy
Exotic Options" published in his excellent book "Managing Energy Price Risk"
as I would really like to have a contribution from Enron on energy
derivatives. Would you be willing to talk to Dr. Kaminski about my proposal ?

 In any event I appreciate your interest in the conference and I only
regret that hurricane Floyd prevented us from meeting in person.

 With very best wishes in the New Year/Millenium

 Laurent Jacque
