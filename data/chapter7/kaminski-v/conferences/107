Dear Vince
?
I would like to invite you to Chair the stream on  Energy and Corporate risk 
management at the GARP Convention. Is this something  that would be of 
interest to you?
?
Also, can I please confirm, because I am having a  few IT problems at 
present, that the following title is correct for  you:
 

Vince Kaminski, Managing Director, Research, Enron  Corp.
I look forward to your response in due course.
?
Kind regards
?
Andreas
