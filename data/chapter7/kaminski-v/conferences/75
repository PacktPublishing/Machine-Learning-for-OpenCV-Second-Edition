Frank,

I have reviewed materials from GARP but did not find any information
about the speaker's perks (like, for example, the right to invite another 
person,
free of charge).

I shall message GARP with this question.

Please, give me a few more days to think about GARP presentation.

Vince,
I just wanted to follow up and see if I can be your guest at the NY GARP 
meeting.   Also, have you had any time to think of a topic for January.  I 
would like to get an email out announcing the meeting.  Let me know your 
thoughts, 
Thanks,
Frank
