Andreas,

Am I entitled to bringing one delegate as a guest, free of charge?
Some conferences offer such privileges.

Vince

Dear GARP 2001 Speaker
?
This is just a quick note to keep you up-to-date  with developments at the 
GARP 2001 Convention, which will be  held in New York between 12th and 15th 
February, 2001.
?
Thus far, GARP 2001 looks set to far exceed our  expectations and GARP 2000. 
There has been a great deal of interest in the 2001  Convention. Delegate 
bookings have been much higher than this time last year. As  a result, we are 
set to far exceed the number of delegates that attention  earlier this year. 
The three workshops and the one-day Asset Management Forum  are also very 
well received and will probably reach full capacity. I will of  course 
provide you with much fuller details closer to the time of the  event.
?
Regarding the event itself, I would like a few  outstanding issues:
?
1. Presentations: can you please  e-mail your presentation to me by 15th 
December, so that I have  enough time to reproduce them and place them in a 
delegate pack for the  Convention. (Given the break of the Christmas and New 
York period, and that the  event is being held in New York, I am sure you can 
appreciate that there are  certain logistical factors that need to be taken 
into account, hence the reason  why the presentations are required as soon as 
possible). This is purely for  reproduction, we also request you bring your 
presentation to the Convention  on the day in either a floppy disc or a 
laptop.
?
2. Audio-Visual Requirements: can  you please inform me of what audio-visual 
requirements you may have (35mm  slides; OHP; LCD projection - notably 
PowerPoint). 
?
3. Check list: I have attached a  check list for your information. If you 
have not returned this already, can you  please read and fax it to my 
colleague, Claire as soon as possible.
?
If you have any questions or queries, please do not  hesitate to contact me, 
otherwise I eagerly await your response in due  course.
?
I look forward to seeing you in New York in  February.
?
Kind regards
?
Andreas
