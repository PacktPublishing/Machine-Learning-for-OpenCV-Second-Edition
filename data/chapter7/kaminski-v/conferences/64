The GARP  2001 Convention & Exhibition
?
Dear GARP 2001 Speaker
?
I am writing concerning the GARP 2001  Convention, which will be held in New 
York between 13th and 14th  February, 2001. 
?
I realise that the Christmas break has meant delays  in sending me 
your?presentation, however, I will need to know when I am  likely to receive 
the presentation so as to make arrangements with the printers,  which are 
based in the US. I am sure you can appreciate that we will need  several 
weeks before the event to collate and print the documentation for the  
delegates. The fact that there are over eighty speakers in four  days means a 
massive logistical task, which needs to be organized  soon.
?
I have therefore set a deadline of  Friday 5th January, 2001. After this date 
GARP can  not guarantee that documentation will be printed and placed in the  
delegate packs. (Please also bear in mind when organising the presentation, 
for  diagrams and charts, that the printing will be in pure?black and  white. 
Please also indicate what audio-visual requirements you may  have: 
35mm?slides; OHP; LCD  projection).
?
Also, if required, please do not forget to book  your hotel accommodation, as 
rooms will not be reserved for GARP speakers and  delegates after the middle 
of January. Attached is a hotel booking  form for your convenience.
?
If you have any questions or queries please do not  hesitate to contact me, 
though I will be out of the office until 2nd January,  2001.
?
Finally, I would like to wish you a wonderful  Festive Season and a happy & 
prosperous New Year. Looking forward to meeting you in New York in February.
?
Kind regards
?
Andreas
