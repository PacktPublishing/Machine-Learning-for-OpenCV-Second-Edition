Vince.  Thanks for getting back to me.   I will have my secretary try to
set up something among the three of us.  Gary, as Vince cannot make a call
on Wednesday, I will have my assistant call you to try to find a suitable
time.  Rachel, Gary Jackson's phone number is 423 751 2593 and Vince
Kaminski's secretary's number is given below.
