Hi Steve:
 Good to hear from you and hope you are liking your new role at U. of 
Maryland. I would like to come but I am not sure if I will be able to make it 
to this conference. I will forward your message to my colleagues and ask them 
to contact you if they are interested.

Thanks,
Krishna.

Krishna:
How are you doing?  I wanted to let you know my new address, I'm now at the
University of Maryland.  Also, in my role as energy cluster chair for the
Maui, Hawaii INFORMS conference (June 17-20, 2001), I am looking for either
session chairs or speakers.  Perhaps you may know of some interested
individuals?  I am also running a session on Optimization and Equilibrium
Modeling in Energy, please send interested speakers (or possible session
chairs to me).  Thanks.
