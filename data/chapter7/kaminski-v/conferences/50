Joe, 

I shall probably ask Tanya to attend. It coincides with Parents' 
Weekend at Stanford. Please, send me the slides anyway.

I shall help Tanya to prepare her presentation.

Vince

Vince,

 I understand you'll be speaking at the CEFER conference. Gary Taylor, the 
head of marketing in the Weather Deriv. group, would like to know if you plan 
on mentioning weather derivatives at all and that if you do, he has numerous 
existing slides and presentations that might be useful to you.

Joe
