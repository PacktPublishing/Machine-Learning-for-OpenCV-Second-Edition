Henwood Power Market Symposium, April 29th-May 1st


We are excited to offer you an invitation to attend the Henwood Power Market 
Symposium.  This annual three-day event will take place from April 29 to May 
1, 2001 in Atlanta, GA at the
Evergreen Mountain Resort.  The goal of the Symposium is to provide our 
guests a forum to conduct business across all energy markets through the 
sharing of experiences and innovations, and
through numerous networking opportunities.  Participants will also gain 
access to Henwood's software products, consulting services and e-Business 
products, as a means to develop competitive
strategies and unequalled value in restructured markets.

The focus of the Symposium is to provide relevant discussion topics, 
technologies and competitive strategies.  This year's featured speakers 
include senior representatives from Enron, Conoco,
Electric Power Research Institute, FERC, New England ISO, and more.

Please register early because space is limited! If you register prior to 
April 1st, the symposium cost is only $875.  After April 1st, the 
registration fee will be increased to $975.  Your registration is
inclusive of the following:

* Complete hotel accommodations for Sunday April 29th and Monday April 30th, 
2001
* All meals and refreshments for April 29th through May 1st. A welcome 
reception is planned for Sunday, April 29th.  This reception is an excellent
