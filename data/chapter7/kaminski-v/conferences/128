International Electric Industry Conference

For the past five years, the Association of Power Exchanges (APEx)
has held its business meetings in different locations around the
world.  For the first time, an industry conference is being held to
compliment these meetings, providing a means to connect industrial
electricity exchanges, ISOs and Pools with senior leaders in the
worldwide electric industry.
