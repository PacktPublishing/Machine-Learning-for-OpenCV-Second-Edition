If the schedule works, perhaps a carpool is best for attending the course, 
given the number of us going.  Vasant has offered to drive.  Dependiing on 
driving speed and traffic, leaving Houston by 9:30am should give sufficient 
time to make the 1pm class, including some time for lunch.

Please let me know if you are interested in the carpool or have alternate 
plans or suggestions.

Thanks,
Martin
