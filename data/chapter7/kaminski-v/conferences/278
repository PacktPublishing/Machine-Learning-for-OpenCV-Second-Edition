Vince,

Please send a package of article reprints to the attention of Joan Payne at
the following address:

Joan Payne
Department of Finance
E. J. Ourso College of Business Administration
Louisiana State University
2163 CEBA
Baton Rouge, LA 70803

In your package, please indicate which presentation each reprint is
intended for; i.e., whether it is for student consumption on Thursday
afternoon or finance faculty/doctoral student consumption on Friday
morning.  Joan can make sure that we get the right number of copies
produced for the respective audiences.

Concerning powerpoints-- just email these files to me and if it is all
right with you I will make them available for download by the faculty and
students on the class and research seminar webpages.

Thanks again for being willing to visit LSU and present your knowledge to
our faculty and students.

Sincerely,

Jim Garven
