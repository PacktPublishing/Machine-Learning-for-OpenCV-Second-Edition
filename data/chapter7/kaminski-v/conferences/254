Dawn,

I met David Sobotka from Koch this morning and we talked about  coordinating 
our presentations.
This means there will be changes intended to avoid overlaps. Sorry for that. 
The portions of my presentation
will survive (those about valuation paradigms) and I shall add a few more 
pages on accounting treatment of weather derivatives
plus more specific examples. David will cover primarily market evolution + 
plus examples of some
standard structures, and we shall both give more interesting examples of
specific deals executed by our companies.

I shall send you an updated version of my part next week. Let me know what 
the deadline is.

Vince

Thanks -- would you like me to include these in the conference book? or do
you anticipate changes?
