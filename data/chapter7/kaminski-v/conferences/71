Dear Colleague:

We are pleased to report that we had a very exciting and productive year 
with  dozens of activities around the world. As we enter our 10th year of 
operations,  the IAFE has additional membership options available to you. 
Please take a  moment to look at the attached membership form with the 2001 
rate schedule.  Based on member requests, a Premium Membership is now being 
offered that  includes the Annual Conference at a 30% discount, the Financial 
Engineer of the  Year dinner, plus a subscription to the Journal of 
Derivatives (JOD). The Full  membership remains as in previous years. The new 
Regular membership includes all  membership benefits except JOD. Membership 
is based on the calendar year January  1 - December 31, 2001. 

Membership is also available on our secured  membership registration form at 
our website http://www.iafe.org/about/join.ihtml. While on  our website, 
please take a moment to visit our calendar listing upcoming events  for the 
new year.
