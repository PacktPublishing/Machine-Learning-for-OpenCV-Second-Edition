Valery,

Thanks a lot. I have received the package last week.
I was traveling and I did not have time to take a  closer look at it yet.

I think about a trip to Dallas sometimes in the first few days of February. I
hope you will find time for lunch. I will contact you later this week 
regarding the date.

Vince

Dear Vince,

Could you please acknowledge receipt of the package with a copy of my article 
on
spikes in power prices, as well as copies of my books and some of my other
relevant articles , that I recently sent to you.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,
Valery
