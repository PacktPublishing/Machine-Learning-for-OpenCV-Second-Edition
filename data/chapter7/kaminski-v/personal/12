Vince,

I've been out of the office the last few days.

As we discussed Friday, Veronica and I hope you can join us, the Stocks and
the Chaneys (Craig Chaney is with EnronCredit.com) for dinner at 7:00 Friday,
April 27th.

Directions from Research and Gosling:

Go west on Research Forest

Turn left the 2nd time you cross Alden Bridge (stop sign after Kuykendall,
shopping center on right with Albertson's, Exxon).

Go approximately 1.4 miles.

Will pass park and elementary school on left.

Take next left - Noble Bend.

Turn right on the 2nd street - Freestone Place.

We are # 30 Freestone Place - the next-to-last home on the right.

Phone # 281-362-7267
