Richard,

Thanks for the invitation. I have already made another commitment
but it's conditional on a few  related events (friends of friends
coming to town). If the other event is canceled, I shall be glad to
join you. I shall let you know in a few days.


Vince

nd=20
Paula Corey=01,s birthday

We will have a little soiree at my house on Saturday January 27th, dinner=

however if you arrive too early you may be requested to perform some ranch=
