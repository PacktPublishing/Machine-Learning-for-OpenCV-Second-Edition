Dear Vince,

Greetings from NY and hope that all is well and you had a great
Thanksgiving.  I'll be coming to Houston for 12/6-12/7 and hope you are
available either evening for dinner.  Would be great to see you again and
catch up with the latest... I really enjoyed my visit last April, your
insights, and the risk book you gave me.

I do hope you're available to meet and pls let me know which evening suits
you better.

Best,
Soussan Faiz
