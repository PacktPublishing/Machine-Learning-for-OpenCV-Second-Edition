David,

Can you use my MM funds to cover thislast purchase?
I need to request another check from PWJ 
and it takes always time.

We made the CD purchase for you today.  Don't forget to mail the check.  I
mailed you the receipt from the deposit.  I will call you towards the end of
July and we can discuss your stock option exercise on 8/12.

Thanks for coming by the office yesterday and have a great trip to
Australia.
