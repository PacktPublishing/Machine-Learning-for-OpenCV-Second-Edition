Hello Vince, 

I stopped by to see you today 03/28/01. However, Mrs. Shirley notified me 
that you were out of the country.  Look, I need another favor.  My wife, whom 
you met last summer, and I  have been living in The Woodlands about a month 
now.  We have tried, to no avail, to get her in the local school district as 
a speech pathologist or a K-6 grade school teacher. She could easily find a 
teaching job in the Houston Independent School District. However, I would 
prefer that she taught locally, in The Woodlands.  I need to know if you know 
of anyone we can contact to get her in The Woodlands School System.  I would 
greatly appreciate if you could help us out once again.  I am attaching her 
resume' for your perusal. Thanks A Million Vince!!!

Sincerely,

Datren Williams
