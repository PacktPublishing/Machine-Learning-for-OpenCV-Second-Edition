Subject:  A personal favor 
Vince, 
I have  left a voice mail to you and will wait to talk to you personally. 
My brother  Vikas, who is now in London, is trying to make a switch from 
consulting world to  working for a specific firm. Over last few months, I 
have heard of great deal  about the success of Enron on line business which 
fits well in the area of his  expertise. I am wondering if you know of some 
one in London who he can speak to  regarding career opportunities. 
Since  I spoke to you last, a number of things have changed. Recently, my 
manadate was  broaden to include leading a charge for developing a risk 
management function  for both the domestic and international businesses for 
GMAC. Needless to say,  this is exciting albeit making the life a little 
more hectic than  usual. 
Talk  to you later.
