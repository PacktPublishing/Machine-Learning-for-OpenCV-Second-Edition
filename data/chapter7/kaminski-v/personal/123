Soussan,

It seems we have planned for all contingencies. 
Look forward to meeting you next week.

Vince,

Your suggested arrangement is perfect with me and I love both Italian or
Steak... the choice is yours.  I really look forward to our meeting & I will
be @ the hotel's reception area on time.  It's great that I have your
cell-phone...as a contingency, and just in case you needed to call me, it's
best to leave me a message @ my phone # @ work.

Soussan,

Let's meet at Westin Oaks next to the reception around 6:30 p.m. Thursday.
There are several nice restaurants within a walking distance to the
Galleria.
I shall make a reservation (is Italian or a steakhouse OK?).

You can reach me on Thursday at my cell phone 713 410 5396.

Look forward to meeting you.

Vince

Great!  I look forward to our dinner on Thurs. 12/7 evening.  Hopefully
your
flight will be on time... although having watched 60 minutes last night and
suffered from a # of delays lately, let's hope that the "weather blame"
doesn't get in the way.  It's best to leave me a message @ my usual work #
on Thurs., 914 253 4187, ... I can easily check it in Houston.

I'll be staying @ the Westin Oaks in The Galleria... any preferred place
that I can book (& for what time)??  Coming over to down town won't be a
problem for me either.

Will be great to see you again.

Please, let me know how I can contact you on Thursday, December the 7th,
to confirm.

Look forward to meeting you.

Dear Vince,

Greetings from NY and hope that all is well and you had a great
Thanksgiving.  I'll be coming to Houston for 12/6-12/7 and hope you are
available either evening for dinner.  Would be great to see you again and
catch up with the latest... I really enjoyed my visit last April, your
insights, and the risk book you gave me.

I do hope you're available to meet and pls let me know which evening suits
you better.

Best,
Soussan Faiz
