Hello Patrycja,

Greetings from the Big Apple.

Saturday works for me. Let's meet at 4:00 p.m. at Carrabba's. It's an
Italian
restaurant on I-45 in the Woodlands. After you pass Conroe, take the
Research
Forest exit  (5-10 miles past Conroe) and stay on the feeder road. Go
through
the lights (Research Forest intersection with I-45). As you continue along
the feeder road you will pass on your right the Woodlands Mall and the
ExxonMobil building,. The restaurant will be on your right, about 200-300
yards before the next lights (I-45 and Sawdust).

I shall have my cell phone with me (713 898 9960). In case you arrive early
you can stop at my home: 10 Snowbird Place, (281) 367 5377. I shall send you
later the instructions how to get there. I shall leave home around 3:45.

Look forward to meeting you.


Vince
