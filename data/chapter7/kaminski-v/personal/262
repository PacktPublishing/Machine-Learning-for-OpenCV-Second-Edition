Vince,

I asked my assistant to schedule the meetings with Aram and she will 
contacting your asst..  As far as lunch or diner, I would be interested.  I 
will visit with Aram in the next few days or if you do, you might want to ask 
him.  I believe he is coming for a wedding and he might have a tight schedule 
but lets ask.  Hope all is going well.  JGM
