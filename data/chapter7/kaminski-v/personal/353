Dear Wincently,


We at America Online would like to thank you for spending the time to write 
us.  My name is Ellen and I appreciate the opportunity to assist you 
regarding your recent e-mail.

After reviewing your account, it shows that the annual prepaid fee was not 
successfully collected.  I suggest that you contact your bank regarding this 
matter.  You may also want to contact our Billing Department at 
1-888-265-8003 or at 1-800-827-6364 toll free should you want to resubmit the 
bill.

If there has been a problem billing your account,  America Online may send a 
billing popup screen that states you need to update your billing information 
at Keyword: Billing. America Online does NOT request this information be 
placed anywhere other than at Keyword: <A 
HREF="aol://4344:2452.MSbill2.26154197.604872267">BILLING</A>.  (If you're 
unfamiliar with keywords you can start using them by typing CTRL - K. When 
the Keyword "box" appears, type the keyword in the space provided and click 
the GO button).  It is possible that you will receive the popup more than 
once in a 24 hour period, as we update our database every 24 hours.

The message that America Online sends states:
