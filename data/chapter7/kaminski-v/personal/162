Wicke,
Thanks for a prompt reply. I am not planning any particular trip to Houston
yet. For the time being, I am about to leave for London, and then Poland. I
will most likely be at the Olympics in Sydney in late September, and in NY
in early October. Mid-October could be the first realistic opportunity to
visit with Enron, although I am looking forward to seeing you sooner in Palo
Alto. I am simply curious whether and how we could leverage together core
competencies and connectivity that both our companies seem to have or are
developing.

I am Senior Vice President for Visa USA, responsible for strategy and
planning. I would probably bring with me (though I haven't discuss it yet)
people in charge of our network or/and our COO.
Best,
Andrzej

Andrzej,

Thanks. Please, send me the information about the dates
when you plan to visit Houston. Also, the information about
your position/title/responsibilities (as well as the info
about the other members of your team) would be useful.

I shall be in the Bay Area  between the 10th and the 20th of October.

Hope to see your then.

Wicek
