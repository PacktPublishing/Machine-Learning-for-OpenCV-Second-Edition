Dear Vince,
1.I apologize for not having got back to Karla
earlier but Dauphine is not properly equipped yet.
2.The conference with Samuelson,Merton,Heath,
Ross,McKean etc was spectacular.512 academics
and practitioners came to College de France and
 were very grateful.
3.I was so worn out afterwards that I did not make
it to Houston.I just went to visit Alex after a week
conference on Quantitative Risk Management
where I was speaking at Carnegie Mellon
4.Another former PhD student of mine has been
testing and improving the software.He is great
and modest ;giving the papers I referee and the
conferences I go to,I do believe that we are still
ahead(or way ahead)today.We also beautifully
simplified the valuation of the hourly swings.
Obviously,in case of a problem,my reputation
and your esteem would be more valuable
than 30% of 90,000 USD (to be shared ...)
5.I declined RISK in Houston and NewYork
and am not sure I will have the pleasure
to see you in London.In all cases, we
should coordinate for Paris soon
Helyette
