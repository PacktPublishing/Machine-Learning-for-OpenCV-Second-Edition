Helyette,

Sorry  for not getting back to you earlier. I took a few days off before my
family goes back to California.

I have arranged a replacement for you for the Houston and New York RISK
courses. My colleagues, Stinson Gibner and Steve Leppard, gave two
presentations. I shall be speaking in London on Thursday only. Steve Leppard
will make a presentation on Friday in my place.

I look forward to meeting you in London. I want to make sure that we can sit
down for a few minutes and talk about the Paris presentations.

Vince
