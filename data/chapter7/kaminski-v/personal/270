Jana,

"Cotton Mary" sounds good. It's a film by Ismail Merchant who collaborated
on "A Room with a View", "Howard's View", and other well known movies.
It's a story about two Anglo-Indian sisters.

Vince,

The Angelika has several movies that would be good.  I am familiar with all
but one--"Cotton Mary."  Do you know anything about it?

If you still haven't seen "American Beauty", that is fine with us.  Just let
me know what sounds good to you. We are  flexible when it comes to movies.

Jana
