We are very excited to be able to welcome your ALP team to Enron.  We are
looking to working with you this semester.  To kick things off, we would
like to invite you to Cacciatore's this Thursday for dinner (1/25/01, 7pm).
If you can't stand Italian cuisine, or would like to try a different day or
time, please feel free to make a suggestion.  We look forward to meeting
you.
