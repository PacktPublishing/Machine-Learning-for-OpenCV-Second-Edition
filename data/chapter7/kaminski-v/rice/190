Jack,

This is up to the MBA program. 
I have no problem if they agreed to it.
The only constraint is the space and we
shall have to address the issue on Thursday
during the first class.

Dear Proffesor Kaminski
    I wish to audit the Energy Derivatives class which
you are teaching on Thursday nights.  I am currently a
second year student in the EMBA program and am
Chairman of Nicklos Drilling Company.  Nicklos
Drilling currently operates three land rigs along the
Texas Gulf Coast and is constucting a fourth.  I have
received permision from the EMBA program to audit the
class and the only conditions would be your permission
and space avalability.
   Thank you for your consideration,
Jack S. Blanton, Jr.
