Christie,

Great!! You think big.
It also puts a lot of pressure on the students.

Vince and Ken,

Please see note below.  Rice's president is planning to attend the presentation and dinner!  I'll let you know when I hear from Gil (Dean Whitaker).  Thanks!

Also, please remember that I've scheduled Steve Kean for lunch (I'll have Melinda have lunches brought to the conference room). Please let me know the exact room number and the exact number of lunches needed from your end.

Thanks!

--Christie.
