Good morning:

The Research Group will have 5 Rice students, who are working on an 
Enron project for their Doctorate, coming to Enron for approximately
1 week.  They will be sitting in a conference room located on the 19th
floor Research area.

We need to get them internet access (to be applied to one computer), with
one logon id and password.

Will you please let me know what I need to do to get this accomplished?

They will be coming this Thursday, April 5th.

Thanks!

Shirley Crenshaw
