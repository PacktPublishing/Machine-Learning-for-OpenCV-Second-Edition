Hi, Vince:

We are considering a preliminary list of speakers for Rice/Enron Seminar Series in Finance for Fall 2001 and Spring 2002.  Do you have any persons in mind that you and your group want to include in the list?  Finance faculty will meet to finalize the list later.

Thanks,

Albert

P.S.: Is Ronnie Chahal still around?  She is currently in my Enron distribution list with email address: rchahal@ess.enron.com.  I have received an error message indicating a failure of delivering email to her address.
