Vince:

I have attached the general design we are proposing for the Enron Seminar
Series mug.  We have a little refinement to do - spacing here and there a
couple type-o's but this is the idea.  If you like it, we will put an order 
in.

I'll put out an announcement on the seminar schedule shortly.  So far the
fall line up includes Will Goetzman - Yale, Lenard Mirman - Virgina, Jeff
Pontiff - U. of Washington, George Allyannis - Darden, and Charles Lee -
Cornell.

Thank you.
