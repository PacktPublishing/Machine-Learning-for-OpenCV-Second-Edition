Mark,

I left you a message regarding The National Forum on Corporate Finance
at  Rice.

They would be delighted if you could serve as a panel  member
at this conference.

Here are the coordinates of the professor at Rice who
is in charge. I would appreciate if you could call him
and let him know if you can attend.

Thanks.

Vince
