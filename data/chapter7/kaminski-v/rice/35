Students, Faculty, and Staff,

Don't forget to participate in the Coffee Colloquium this morning (4-25-01)
from 9:45 to 10:45 held outside room 124.  This will be the last Coffee
Colloquium of this academic year.  Hope to see you there.

The Coffee Colloquium is an informal gathering which will allow faculty,
administration, and students an opportunity to talk, exchange ideas and get
to know each other better.  The Jones School Coffee Colloquium will be a
regular gathering every Wednesday (same time, same place) unless there is
another scheduled event (Dean's Lecture, exam day, holiday).  We usually
have coffee, tea, juice, soft drinks, and some light snacks available to
all who participate.

Kathy
