Hi guys,

Vince talked with Christie and they both are available next Tuesday (game day) at 9 am.  Can you meet then to start preparing an outline?

Also would you be up for a presentation at the research group's lunch meeting next Thursday?  Vince will be out, but you'll undoubtably get some interesting questions from others at the meeting, if your up for it.  Let me know soon, and we can schedule you for next Thursday.

talk to you later
