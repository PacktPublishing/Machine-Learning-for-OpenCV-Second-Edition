Vince,

Many thanks for the invitation.? I'm leaving for a conference in New Orleans 
today and won't be in town.? However, I'd love to join you if dinner should 
happen again in the future.

Thanks again for all your support and interest in the ALP program.? I feel 
confident that this will be a great project.

Carrie
