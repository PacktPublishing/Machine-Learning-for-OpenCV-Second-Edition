Hello Mr. Fastow,

Sheridan Titman from UT-Austin and I are both delighted you will be able to
participate in the conference we are organizing here at Rice.  Attached is
a revised overview of the organization - the second page contains an
up-to-date list of the firms involved.

Also, I'm attaching a draft of the actual program.  After each
presentation, I have a panel of three or four people who will can respond
to some of the points or issues raised in each discussion.  These remarks
will be very informal and ad hoc and thus should require no preparation on
your part.  Reaction to this format has been good and I think it will be a
great way to stimulate discussion/debate.

I have you penciled in to serve on one such panel on Saturday morning, May
5.  The topic deals with handing the dilution arising from executive stock
options and involves the top academic expert on executive stock options,
David Yermack from NYU.

Let me know if you have any concerns about this or if a conflict
arises.  Also, I will be e-mailing some registration materials to you in
the next week.

I look forward to seeing you soon.

Dave Ikenberry.
