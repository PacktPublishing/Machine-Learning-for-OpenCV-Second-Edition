I don't know if you noticed that we have Tim Bollerslev on the seminar
schedule for December 8.  In order for Tim to get back to North Carolina on
Friday, we need to move the seminar time.  I thought that the Enron folks
might be interested in his talk so I wanted to get you input on a new
time.  I know that 3:30 is best but would over the noon hour be second best
or would 2:00 be better?

Thanks.
