Perfect.  Thanks, Vince.

In all likelihood, it would be just fine, it is just not customary for job
talks to include others.  Again, since you are a member of the Risk
Management Chair Search Committee (you may not know of this official
capacity, but I believe it is the case), we by all means hope that you will
be able to attend the seminar as well as dinner.

I will get details on the schedules to you early next week.
