Rice/Enron Finance Seminar Series Participants:

We are getting ready to kick off the 2000/2001 Enron Finance Seminar Series
at Rice University.

You can find the current schedule at http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~jgsfss/ .
Note that this is a new web address.

For your convenience, here are the dates and speakers lined up so far:

Sept 22    Jeff Pontiff, U. of Washington
Sept 29    Len Mirman, U. of Virginia
Oct    6    Charles Lee, Cornell
Oct   13   George Allayannis, Darden
Oct   20   William Goetzmann, Yale
Nov   17   Yacine Ait-Sahalia, Princeton (joint seminar with Rice Economics)

Mar    9    Paul Schultz, Notre Dame
Apr   27    Luigi Zingales, U. of Chicago


Lined up for the spring but date not yet scheduled:

Tim Bollerslev, Duke University
Matthew Richardson, New York University


As changes are made to the schedule, I will notify the distribution list.

In addition, as we have done in the past, we will post the abstract and a
downloadable version of the paper (if available) to the website a week or
two before the seminar.  The website will also provide a link to the
speaker's homepage so you can access his or her biographical
information.  If the paper is not available at the website, I will send a
hardcopy to interested Jones School faculty, to Felecia Jones (Economics),
Latha Ramchand (University of Houston), and Vince Kaminski (Enron).

I will e-mail an announcement before each seminar, reminding you of the
seminar date, time, and location.  The distribution list will include
everyone that receives this e-mail.  Please contact me at ostdiek@rice.edu
if you would like to be deleted from the mailing list or if you know of
someone who should be added (new PhD students, new faculty, etc.).
