Good to hear from you.  Things are going pretty well hear, but busy with the
end of the semester coming up.

As for U of H, I guess there are several possibilities depending on what
Shane wants to do.  The best researcher in their group by far, in my
opinion, is Bong-Soo Lee.  But he does more general asset pricing stuff.
Minnesota econ phD, really smart.  Their main derivatives guy is Rabon
Rabinovich.  He's done some good work in the past but not very active in the
last five or ten years.  Or, you could go with Ron Singer or Art Warga
(Art's more respected and more active).  These guys are more senior, more
general, and do more research than Ramon -- I would guess that they tend to
be the workhorses in terms of advising PhD students at u of h.

In any case, please destroy this info as soon as you digest it.  I would
hate for my candidate assessments to ever get passed along to the good folks
at u of h.
