Hi Judith!

I  have a special parking ticket for Malcolm and Gil to use in Dr. Gillis's 
car.  Then, I'll have a car pick up Gil when he's ready to leave the 
game--we'll take care of everything (thanks for offering)--we're really 
looking forward to the event!

Best regards for a great weekend!

--Christie.

at Enron Box at Enron Field


Christie:

Could you please fill me in on the logistics?  Dr. Gillis and Gil Whitaker
will
be at the APL project presentation at Enron at 4 p.m..  Further, they both
plan
to attend the dinner at Enron Field.  However, Dr. Gillis must skip the
game due
to an early morning breakfast the next day.  Will you provide special parking
at the dinner/game?  I think Dr. G and Gil will go together, then I will have
Dr. Gillis picked up by limo, at approximately 8:00 p.m.  Does this sound
feasible?
