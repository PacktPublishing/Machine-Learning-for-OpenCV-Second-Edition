HI Vince,
As always, I enjoyed having dinner with you.  Its always interesting.

Per your recommendation from last night, you should have received a note I
just sent to Andy Fastow.

If you can fit it into you schedule, Sheridan and I would appreciate having
you attend the conference, the conference dinner and reception.  Also, if
you would like to participate on Saturday only, that is a possibility as
well.  Whatever might work with you.

Regards,

Dave
