You are confirmed for the following course:

We encourage you to coordinate participation in this workshop with others at

International callers must pay for their own long distance charges.

Our course is being produced by Virtual-Workshops.com. A few days from now you
will receive registration confirmation from them. A few days prior to the
course, you will receive log-on and dial up instructions from them as well as
files of the slides which will be used so that you can print them out and take
notes if appropriate.
