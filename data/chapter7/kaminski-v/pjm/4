PJM will again offer a one-day course, PJM 101: The Basics, on February 27, 
2001
as a Virtual Workshop over the Internet.

PJM 101: The Basics will introduce participants to the PJM market and 
operations
model. It will include presentations on PJM Market settlements, capacity
assurance and markets, transmission expansion and the status of PJM ancillary
services markets and other initiatives. The coups is designed for those new to
PJM.

A limited number of participants will be registered since this is a pilot
program to determine if such a format is effective. The course times are 9:00
a.m. to 12 noon and 1:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. Participants should plan to log in 
a
half hour before the scheduled start time.

Further details and registration information can be found on the PJM web site 
at
