EES Production Cut-Over

The production EES application will be made available to the registered users 
on
Monday April 17, 2000 for day-ahead scheduling.  The production system will be
preloaded with all schedules submitted through the current scheduling process 
to
that point (PJM identifiers for these pre-loaded schedules will be provided
through the usual scheduling practices).   Hourly schedules may be entered
beginning April 18, 2000.

The Sandbox will be made unavailable at the time of production implementation.
Prior to April 17, the https://eestest.pjm.com URL will be reserved for the
Sandbox.  Beginning April 17, the https://ees.pjm.com URL will point to the
production EES application.

Users with accounts on the Sandbox will automatically have accounts on the
production system.  If you have not registered, please complete the
