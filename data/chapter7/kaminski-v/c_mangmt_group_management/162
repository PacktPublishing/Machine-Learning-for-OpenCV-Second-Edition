Norma,

The need for a new position within the research group has evolved along with 
our expanding responsibilities, and we would like to fill that position with 
an already on-board employee familiar with same, that person being William 
(Sam) Smith.

The new position created it that for a Staff Specialist, who would be 
responsible for technical duties including evaluation and quality control of 
weather forecasting procedures, design and preparation of  the research 
Intelligence Intelligence newsletter, operational responsibilities related to 
Morning Report assembly, and hurricane season surveillance as well as 
satellite system supervision..

We would like to make this retroactive to January 1st of this year.
