Hi Dawn:

The Research Group has moved around so much that we do not know
who to contact for accounting issues.  We need to reverse some money
back to one of the groups we are supporting, but do not know who to contact.
Do you have a clue?

We are also still using an SAP Corp. Co# and RC# because we do not
know where to go to get the new ENA #'s.

If you could help in this we would really appreciate it.

Thanks!

Shirley Crenshaw
