Martin,

I don't  see any problem. The article supportsEnron's position.

Please, go ahead.

Martin,

Let me read it Friday. We run our papers by our PR
department to review for any potential conflict with the company line.
I shall fwd it to them.

I think you should submit it as an Enron employee with a note
that it was developed when you were at UT.

Subject: publication submission question

My supervising professors from UT and I are finishing a paper (finally!) that 
is based on work done for my PhD.  All of the research was done while I was a 
grad student.  I have a couple of questions regarding submission of this 
paper (to IEEE Transactions on Power Systems).

1.  Should I submit it with my affiliation as The University of Texas at 
Austin or as Enron (ENA, Corp, etc)?

2.  What legal or other reviews/clearances would I need?

A draft of the paper for your review is attached.

Thanks,
Martin
