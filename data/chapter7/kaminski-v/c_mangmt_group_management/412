Janelle, 

FMS records show that ext. 39189 was installed on 6/1 for Mr. Paleologo,  
There is no record to indicate the phone was ever PUDed.  

I have requested to Kathy Brooks to re-install the phone.  Kathy says that 
she will reseach to find out why the phone was picked up and she will let me 
know.

Thanks
Linda
