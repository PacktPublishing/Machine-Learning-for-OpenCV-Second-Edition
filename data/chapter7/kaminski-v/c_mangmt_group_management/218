Stephen Bennett, professional meteorologist, was hired into the Research=20
group in September of this year as a Specialist based on salary alignment=
=20
criteria.  In retrospect, and upon review, he should have been hired on as =
a=20
Senior Specialist.

After coming on board. it rapidly became apparent that Stephen was clearly =
an=20
"under hire."  He is well-deserving of an immediate promotion (really more =
of=20
a correction) and pay raise, to be made retroactive at least to the 1st of=
=20
this month. This memo outlines the circumstances surrounding this hiring=20
error and provides detailed justifications for this retroactive "promotion.=
"

At the time of the interview process, there was no position in Enron=20
designated as "Professional Meteorologist."  In fact, the most recent simil=
ar=20
hire prior to that date was Jose Marquez, also a professional meteorologist=
,=20
who was hired in, based on salary alignment criteria, as a manager.  While=
=20
functionally, both these men are meteorologists, Enron has no such job=20
classification. Compounded by the urgency in bringing on additional=20
professional expertise in short time order, it was difficult to peg the=20
proper Enron classification appropriate for this new position.  This origin=
al=20
uncertainty and resulting misplacement of Stephen into the Specialist=20
category, rather than the Senior Specialist category, needs to be corrected=
=20
at this time.

Although a "new-hire" to Enron, Stephen Bennett has extensive work=20
experience.  He has worked as a professional meteorologist at both the=20
Weather Services Corporation in Boston and at The Weather Channel in=20
Atlanta.  He came to Enron well-referenced by both those organizations,=20
needing no further training and only minimal supervision.

Once aboard here in Houston, Stephen immediately demonstrated the core Enro=
n=20
values with our unique sense of urgency.  After only a week, he assumed=20
responsibilities normally reserved for someone actually at even a manager=
=20
level - he was assigned and fully took over the critical afternoon weather=
=20
briefings to the gas traders.  This includes analysis and report preparatio=
n=20
as well as presentation.  Also in the presentation arena, he now regularly=
=20
briefs various desks in the morning and throughout the day.  Stephen is a=
=20
master of communication and particularly adept at conveying what through=20
other messengers might otherwise seem confusing or ambiguous.

Stephen has also demonstrated an unusually high level of self-initiative.  =
He=20
designed, implemented, and now maintains several sub-sites on the Research=
=20
web page which he tailored to various customers - in specific: the weather=
=20
derivatives team, the agricultural team, and most recently, the crude and=
=20
liquids team.  I have recently assigned Stephen to spearhead our conversion=
=20
and major upgrade of this web page.

These above described accomplishments are above and beyond Stephen=01,s reg=
ular=20
duties which include starting work at 5 am daily, reliably and without fail=
,=20
to assemble and prepare our trader=01,s weather report.  Recently, with the=
=20
advent of extended hours for both NYMEX and EnronOnline, Stephen voluntaril=
y=20
on his own accord, assists in our new Sunday weather support effort.  As hi=
s=20
supervisor, fully cognizant of his already standard 50+ hour work week, I d=
o=20
not solicit, but readily accept, this above and beyond expectations=20
assistance.

In review, the circumstance which resulted in this under hire condition was=
=20
Enron=01,s immediate need for a non-standard, fairly unique professional - =
a=20
meteorologist, coupled with Stephen=01,s desire to work for our company in =
spite=20
of the absence of a hierarchy which included the exact entitled professiona=
l=20
title reflecting his chosen career path..  Once hired, Stephen has clearly=
=20
demonstrated through contribution and performance that he is well-deserving=
=20
of this immediate and retroactive promotion.
