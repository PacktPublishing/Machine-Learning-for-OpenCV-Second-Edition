Discussions with Lance during his hire were intended to have Lance start 
prior to bonus and merit eligibility.  Therefore, Lance accepted the position 
under the impression he would be eligible for both Bonus and Merit.

Lance Cunningham, Mgr, hired 10/2/00, rated "Satisfactory" has a $5K (5.55%) 
equity inc indicated in GCS.  Please give more detail.  I realize he was 
rated; however, he was hired after 10/1 and his rating is SAT.
