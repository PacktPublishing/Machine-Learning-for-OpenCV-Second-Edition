Geynille,

I understand you are in charge of recruiting at the UofH. I am forwarding to 
you the resume 
of one of the students  of the University of Houston.

She is involved with the international organization called AIESEC and I was 
most
impressed by her organizational skills and professional attitude. I used
to work as a volunteer for this organization many years ago and I am
still helping their local chapter.

As far as I know, she signed up for an interview with Enron.
