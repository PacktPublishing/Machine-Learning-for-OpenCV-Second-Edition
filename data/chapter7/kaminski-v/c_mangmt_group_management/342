Vince, 
 Today is the last day of my internship here this summer.  I have had a 
terrific summer.  Thank you so much for all of your support!  I have talked 
with my supervisor from this group and I am pleased that he feels strongly 
and positively about my performance.  Of course, my job decision is a very 
important one for me and as I consider job offers in the upcoming months, a 
variety of factors will be influencing my choice.  Certainly one of them will 
be the positive experiece I have had with Enron.  But regardless of my 
decision in future, I am so glad that I have had the opportunity to glimpse 
into Enron's business and culture.  I have met some amazing people here, and 
my experience with Enron is something I will always take with me whereever I 
go.  

I hope to hear from you again.  Please feel free to contact me at any time.  
My email remains: vngo@rice.edu and I will leave Shirley my phone number as 
soon as I know it!

Deepest regards,
Van
