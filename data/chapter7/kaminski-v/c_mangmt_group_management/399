Jim,

I agree with you. It just burns your time and mine. I shall take care of it
when Ravi comes back from vacation.

Vince,

Ravi never said a word to me and should have closely coordinated with me - 
otherwise he should have used his own name.  I have a problem with Ravi 
acting in that manner.  No one is questioning Shalesh' integrity but the 
Associate Analyst program called me and stated that Shalesh told them that I 
had requested the move.  If he did that he should not have used my name.  I 
am very sensitive to Analysts moving within a rotation.  It has happened to 
me numerous times and I do not appreciate the disruption it can cause.  If 
you need Shalesh for any reason then he will not be moving. 

Regards

Jim

Jim,

Clarification regarding Shalesh' transfer to EBS.

The request to rotate Shalesh out of Research into EBS
came from Ravi Thuraisingham. My understanding was that it was
fully coordinated with you and I was more than happy to oblige.

Shalesh is concerned that his integrity is being questioned and I can assure
you that he was not the instigator of the move.

My impression is that Shalesh is doing a very good job and Ravi is very happy
him. I shall be glad to keep him in the Research Group in his current role.

Have a good 4th of July.

Vince
