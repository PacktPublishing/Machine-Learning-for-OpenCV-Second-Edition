Jeff,

I met with Li Sun last night and I shall take her for the first rotation.
She comes across as a very smart and highly motivated person.

I am planning to go with Mark Palmer to Wharton in October to
finalize the deal.

Vince

i've asked vince to get involved with you about getting li into vince's 
group.  this issue needs to  be resolved by week's end--we look like we don't 
have our act together, and that bothers me.  especially since we are about to 
make a significant monetary investment at wharton, and we could have a new 
wharton recruit disgruntled.

vince, can you set up a meeting with you, me and mark palmer to follow up 
with our meeting with skilling?  thanks very much...

jeff
