I will be on the call. I may disconnect around 4:00 to attend the traders' 
daily meeting. 
A couple of issues:
1. Would it be possible to get Gappy a cell phone for the summer? He does not 
have a phone at home. I think the reason for avoiding installing a phone in 
his apartment is the increasing cost of his Houston stay.
2. It is getting noisier here. Gappy and I are wandering if we could get 
office space downstairs (that we share). We will maintain presence on 44, but 
we will be able to discuss when needed.
