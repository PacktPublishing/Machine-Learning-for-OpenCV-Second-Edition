Subject: Update / Event Time Change

Thanks to everyone for attending the meeting today! 

EVENT TIME CHANGE!!!
I just spoke with the Office of the Chairman and have learned that Ken and 
Jeff are actually available during the morning of December 19th from 8:00am 
until 11:00am.  As a result, our plans have changed just a little and I have 
requested whether or not they are willing to pose for Polaroid pictures with 
employees - I'll let you know what I find out!  We will still have the jazz 
duet and informational poster displays in the lobby throughout the day and 
instead of dessert items, we'll order breakfast stuff.

ASSIGNMENTS / BUDGET!!!!
Please note assignments below; for each team, collaborate between now and our 
next meeting to determine what purchases need to be made - budgets will be 
discussed at that meeting.  Again, it will be on Wednesday, December 6th from 
9:30am until 10:30am with the location TBD.
