We talked to Rabi. He's sitting on the fence for some good reasons, and he 
has to weigh what is fairly comfy job situation for one that starts out at a 
lower level but has more potential.   WRT the GREEN, Vince verbally offered 
salary of $105k plus a guarantee that his bonus at year end would be a 
minimum of $15k cash.  That's in addition to the $15k sign on bonus.  Vince 
said that we would not bother working up a revised offer letter unless and 
until Rabi came back with a verbal ok.  He will ponder the offer; probably 
for a few more days and get back with us.  He may well call you to discuss 
the exact details of the benefits.  ESOP, 401(k) contributions, etc.


Regards,
Grant.
