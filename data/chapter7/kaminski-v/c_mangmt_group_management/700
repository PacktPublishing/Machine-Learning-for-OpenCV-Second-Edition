Subject: Conference Room

Goodmorning Vince ,

We added a bookcase to the conference room on the 19th floor
however ,due to the departments growth I think we could use
another one.

Vince , in the long run it would save us some time.

Please let me know if this is okay!

                                                                          
Thanks 
                                                                      Kevin
