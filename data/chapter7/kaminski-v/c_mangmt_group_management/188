We spoke prior to the holiday and you were working on a list on support names 
and projects that Research is working on for various BUs.  Can you tell me 
how you are doing on that?  Sarah Brown, my manager, had a meeting with Corp 
and they are disputing the billing we are proposing to bill to them ($1.9M).  
Their argument is that they are going to bill ENA back anyway; therefore, 
they have agreed to take 40% of the amount we intented to bill them in 2001, 
which is approximately $760K.  If you have any questions, please call.  
Thanx.
