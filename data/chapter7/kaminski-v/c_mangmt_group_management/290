Subject: Conference: Monetary Policy in the New Economy

I would like to attend the following conference:  "Monetary Policy in the New 
Economy" on October 19th in Washington DC. This is the topic of an Annual 
Conference on Monetary Policy.  Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan is the keynote 
speaker.   Also, former Fed Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson and many  prominent 
monetary economists will be attending and participating in the debate on U.S. 
monetary policy.   The cost of the conference is $375.  While in Washington, 
I could also arrange meetings with the IIF economist on our largest 
investment exposures.  In addition, I could interview Mark Giancola and 
possibly some other candidates from Johns Hopkins School of Advanced 
International Studies for our group.  

Regards, 


Maureen
