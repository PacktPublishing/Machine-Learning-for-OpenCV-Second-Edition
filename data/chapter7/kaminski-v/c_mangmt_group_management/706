According to Alex,  Li Xiao gave your email address to Alex.  Did Li Xiao 
talk to you first about Alex? I don't know for certain.  Alex contacted you 
in March, interviewed once, but nothing came of it.  After Gary left, Li Xiao 
suggested to Alex that he try again, and the rest is history. 

Grant.

Can you advise as to whether or not Li Xiao referred Alex to you last 
summer.  I need to know this in order to process
an employee referral (under old plan) for her.
