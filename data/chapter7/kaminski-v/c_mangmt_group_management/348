Craig-

Thanks for the feedback.

I've received similar reports from other research customers on various 
non-recurring and on-going projects Elena has been able to help out on.

The most recent member of a long line of Rice MBA candidates who have "made a 
difference" in our research efforts, Elena will be staying with us throughout 
this next (her final) year.

She'll be working the morning shift.

Please let us know if she, or any other member of our group can assist you in 
any way.

- Mike
