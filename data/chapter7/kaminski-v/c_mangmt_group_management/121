Vince,
 Per the dialogue below, there seems to be some agreement between our two 
groups that a subscription to the "Institute for International Finance" is 
worth receiving, but to do so in one central subscription and split the 
cost.  Is a $16K share OK for your group?  We'll do $32K on our end, and then 
try and sell some of our share to my European counterpart once he gets better 
established with a bigger budget.

Scott- could you give Vince a call or an email to recommend that he kick in 
16K for the Institute for International Finance?  We would pay 32K (maybe get 
Jim Roth to pick up some down the road).

I haven't heard back from VInce yet on the price, but we definitely need to 
continue our access to IIF.  Can you count us in for a slice of the cost and 
advise me how many others depts you can recruit to help pay the annual fees.  
Once you have a final count, it may reduce our costs in Research.  Thanks,

GEK

If you need access to consensus data occasionally let me know and I can pull 
it for you.  Let me know when you get an answer on IIF.  I will also be 
looking for others to buy in.

Robert,

Thanks for itemizing the costs.  We have decided to cancel the Oxford 
Analytica, as we receive a consensus forecast for currency and inflation from 
another source.  Regarding IIF, it is an important source for us.  I will 
discuss the costs within the Research Group and advise you of how we will 
proceed.

Gwyn

Hi Maureen and Gwyn-

On the Oxford Analytica front, I'm glad you have found the service useful.  
Our contract with them has expired and we are currently negotiating for more 
users to have access.  Our current contract is for $50K or $10K per user per 
year.  We can charge $10K back to you.

On the IIF front, the invoice for $47K is due at the end of the month.  Here 
I would propose that we pay two thirds (to cover our costs and the costs of 
our Competitive Analysis colleagues in London), leaving $15K for you to cover.

Since we took on these services last year, we have expanded our range of 
sources and projects and are consequently trying to do more with less. Thus I 
need to allocate some of our costs from OxAn and IIF to other projects.

Let me know what you think about this proposal.  Maureen, congratulations on 
your secondment to Enron Metals (Gwyn mentioned it to me).  FYI, our 
colleague Jim Roth is providing Competitive Analysis support to Joe Gold and 
John Sherriff on that project from London.
