Dear all,

I have decided to attend Carnegie Mellon's Computational Finance program for 
the
2001-2002 academic year. The program starts on May 14th. 

Unfortunately due to the quick arrival of the starting date, my last day at 
Enron will
have to be Friday, April 13th 2001.

I have really enjoyed my last 10 months here at Enron which I've spent with 
the 
Research Group. 

Thank you.

-Hector
