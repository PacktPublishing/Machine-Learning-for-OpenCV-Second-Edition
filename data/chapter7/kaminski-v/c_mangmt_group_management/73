Recently, I talked with you about ordering another filing unit.  It turns out 
that we need 2 more filing units.  Please order them the same size as the 
floor to ceiling cabinet we have.  Have the inside of the cabinets configured 
as follows:

1 Cabinet should have 5 shelves
1 Cabinet should have 6 shelves

When Interstore was here today reconfiguing 2 of our existing cabinets, they 
removed 8 shelves that they are going to use on these new units.

Please price these 2 new units and charge them to Co. # 0413, RC # 107043.  
Please let me the prices and approximate delivery date.  Also, let me  know 
if you need anything else.  Thanks.  Anita
