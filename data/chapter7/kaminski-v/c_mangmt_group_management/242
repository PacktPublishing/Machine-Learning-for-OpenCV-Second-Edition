Vince,

A reminder that I'm gone on Tuesday to Spearman.

Status of projects:

1.  Compound option for power structuring (Bernie, Edith Cross, Nick ?)
 Alex has finished the model.   Paulo has done some validation so we can 
probably release it.
 This is will be used for an exotic book, so we may have to help with VAR 
interface, etc.

2.  Followed up with Laine Borgman on DG contract.  We still need legal's 
sign off.

3.  Left a message and email about Tom Barkley with Molly Magee and told Tom 
that an offer would be coming by next week.
