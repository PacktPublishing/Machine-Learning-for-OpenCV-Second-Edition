Candice,

Maureen was sick for the last few days.
When she comes back, I shall ask her to start the process regarding
a formal offer for you.

Dear Dr. Kaminski,

I would like to thank you and your colleagues, Dr. Gibner and Ms.
Raymond-Castaneda, for taking the time to talk with me. I enjoyed the visit
very much and will be looking forward to the opportunity of working as a
summer intern at Enron. You mentioned that you will call me this week. In the
event I'm not at home, please leave a message at my home phone number (713)
647-7161 or email me at my Houston email address cedkao@aol.com.

Sincerely,
Candice Kao
