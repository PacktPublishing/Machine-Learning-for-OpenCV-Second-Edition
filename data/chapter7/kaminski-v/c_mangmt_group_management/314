Hi,

Can and should we organize a tag-team baby sitting detail?  Aghh!  Another 
weekend that is not my own!

Grant.

Grant,  what do you think?     If you really want this guy, you may suggest 
someone in your group to "entertain" them while they are here. 
What do you think?

Toni,
I spoke with Ben today and he is planning to pay for a trip to bring his
wife to Houston this weekend and show her around in hopes of overcoming her
hesitiation on moving.  His question is whether Enron will give him the time
to bring her down here and then give  an answer next week?  If you will let
me know how you, Grant, and Vince feel about that.

thanks,

Mike
