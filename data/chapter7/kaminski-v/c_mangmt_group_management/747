We went and looked at the Toshiba copier on the 32nd floor and while it
does not appear to be extremely fast, I believe it will work for the 19th
floor.  I spoke with Vince Kaminski and he agreed with our getting this
copier. 

We noticed this copier has a button that says "Network connection"
and were wondering it this copier could be hooked up to the network and
we could run copies from our computer?  Please let us know.  

Thanks for all your help and have a wonderful Christmas and New
Year!

Shirley ,

Following up on the telephone conversation, please see the attached 
spreadsheet for pricing information PLUS important information about "True 
World" copy speeds. 

Pricing was centered on the 42.315K per month volume band so that you can get 
a good feel for copier expenditure based on average month volumes. I have 
left the spreadsheet "unprotected" so that you can play with the volume 
figures and see how this changes the price overall + how the "Cost Per Image" 
is affected by volume changes.

? Pricing Spreadsheet: Under "NOTES" towards under the pictures.

The "True World" copy speed information has been supplied by Buyers Lab 
Incorporated, which is an independent testing house that rates office 
equipment, including copiers and publishes their findings on a quarterly 
basis. Unfortunately they have not released their findings on the Canon IR550 
as testing is not yet complete.

? Copier Speeds: @ the end of the Notes-Mail
{These include 1-1, 1-2 and duplexing + detail on completion of "sets"}

As you will see, duplexing speeds are widely different across the various 
manufacturers equipment & the "True World" copy speeds are a soft $ expense 
which impacts the true cost of running a copier.

Toshiba 6570     400K        135K
Lanier 5255 {Per Rep.}   200K                       100K
Lanier 5265 {Per Rep.}   200K                       100K
Canon IR550    200K          100K
Canon IR600    250K          100K

FYI: We currently have a Toshiba 6570 @ EB32K1 that is averaging 69,332 
images per month with the top month producing 86,673 images and a Toshiba 
5570 @ EB3080 area that is averaging 39,309 per month. Both of these machines 
are in the Enron North America Trading environment.

The copiers quoted are all "Digital".
Digital: Scan once print many = 99 copies of one sheet? 1 Scan!
Analog: Scan for every image made = 99 copies of 1 sheet? 99 Scans = Possible 
noise issue.

Copier Speeds = Total print time
This comparison gives the speed @ which the document set is printed
{No Staple, No 3-hole punch}
