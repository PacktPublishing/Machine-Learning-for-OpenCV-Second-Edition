Back in November of last year, you have indicated that 40% of the 17.5% (40% 
of 17.5 is 7%) that we are allocating to EGM should be billed to Gary 
Hickson's group.  Gary is asking for further broken down of this 40% to his 
world.  Can you check with Vince to see what portion of the 7% should be 
charged to Equity Trading, Rate & Currency Trading, Agricultural Trading & 
Origination and Convertible trading?  And can I get this information back by 
the end of this week because we are going to start closing on Friday.  If you 
have any questions, call me.  Thanx.

Becky,

I have attached your original emails below.  Can you provide further break 
out of the 40% allocation to Gary Hickerson.  Gary is responsible for 
Financial Trading which includes:
? Equity Trading
? Rate & Currency Trading
? Agricultural Trading & Origination
? Convertible Trading

Thanks for your help.

Becky,

I gave the %% for EGM to Shirley. I assume she communicated this info to you 
already.
I assume EGM includes F/X - I/R (Gary Hickerson), weather, insurance (Jere 
Overdyke),
oil trading and coal.

For CALME I don't have any info. Let's split the cost evenly.

Vince

Shirley,

GRM is now with EGM group.  EGM wants to verify that the 17.5% we are going 
to allocate to GRM is for the Insurance, Jere Overdyke group.  EGM seems to 
think that their Weather, Mark Tawney group, is receiving support from 
Research.  Also, can we break out the support for CALME?  CALME is going to 
split into 3 BUs and I am trying to determine who I need to bill for Research 
supports.  If you have any questions, call me.  Thanx.
