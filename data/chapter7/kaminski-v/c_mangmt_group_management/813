Anne,

Thanks. Shirley is checking my calendar and will call you about the schedule.
The entire week of the 11th does not look good for me.

Vince

Vince,

Just wanted to check with you to see if you have a preference as to when you would like to have your mid-year PRC meeting.  If you and your team are available, I would prefer to have it on either June 12th, 13th or 14th.  I am very flexible though, so please just let me know so that I can start making the necessary accommodations.

Thanks,
Anne
