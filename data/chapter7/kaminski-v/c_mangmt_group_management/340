Hi,

I'd like to thank you for the opportunity of letting me work here this 
summer.  I've learned a lot in the past three months and hopefully have been 
of some help around here.  I was very impressed with this department, and 
Enron itself, and I really appreciate the chance for me to have worked in 
such an environment.

So anyway, thank you and I wish you and the department well,

Brad
