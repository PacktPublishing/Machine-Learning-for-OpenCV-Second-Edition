Hello Iain ,
Well time is drawing near for another move
for us.
The problem is we do not have a heavy duty
copier for the floor.
We do need a copier.

Please inform me as how we can work through 
this , maybe we can split the cost with others on the floor.

The move is schedule sometime at the end of the month.

I will keep you informed........

                                                           Thanks
