I have left a message with Teresa and have sent the following terse note to 
Lance to let him know that we are moving.
As we discussed, I asked Teresa to offer 90K +10K signing bonus. 


Regards,
Grant

Lance:

I am going on vacation tomorrow, but I wanted to get in touch with you before 
I left.

I have asked HR to extend an offer to you.  Teresa Bien should be sending you 
an offer letter via Fedex. Of course, with the July 4th weekend, I'm not sure 
when you will get it.  

If you have questions, I suggest that you call Vince Kaminski at 713 853 
3848. 

Regards,
Grant Masson.
