HI Brad:

I am it for our group!  However, it might be a good idea to train Sam Smith
also.

Please let us know.

Thanks!

Lydia/Rosie/Donna/Shirley,

We are looking to implement SAP HR by 7/1/00.  There is a time keeping module 
in the program.  Please send me a list of the time keepers for your groups.  
Do not forget to send your own name if you keep time.  Time keepers will be 
contacted in the near future for training on the new system.

Thank you for your help,
Brad
