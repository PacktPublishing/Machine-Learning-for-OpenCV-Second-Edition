Vince - Thanks so much for the job description.  I forwarded it to our legal 
counsel for their review, and they were very pleased with it.
They said it really helped them to understand what Vincent is actually doing, 
which will enable them to better prepare his case.

Thanks again.

Candace

I still do not have a job description for Vincent's position.  Maybe
Enron does not have one?

Candace, here is a sample job description.  Please check with Vincent's
supervisor on modifying this for the job description.  This was my best
guess, but I may be way off... If so, we have many other generic
examples to use instead.  Just let me know.
