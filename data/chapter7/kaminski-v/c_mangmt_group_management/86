Vince,

I just wanted to follow-up with you regarding the action items that were 
taken away from yesterday's meeting with you, Mike Roberts, Norma, and myself.

1)  Tony Hamilton
As you know Tony's official start date was March 12, 2001, and he has yet to 
receive a paycheck.  London's pay cycles are different than ours however, and 
they only get paid on the 20th of each month.  Tony did not receive a 
paycheck on March 20th because all of his new hire information has to be put 
into SAP (the payroll system) by the first of the month for the employee to 
receive a check on the 20th.  Consequently, Tony will not receive his first 
paycheck until April 20th.  If you would like for me to try and work with the 
London office however and try to get him a paycheck quicker than that, please 
let me know.

2)  Joe Carson
From what I am able to gather, Gary Hickerson did make Joe Carson an offer 
that consisted of a one-year contract.  However, Gary is out of town until 
Monday, and no one is sure of the specifics of the deal.  Would you like me 
to contace Joe to find out the specifics, or would it be more acceptable for 
me to wait until Gary returns so that I can get all of the facts.

I look forward to working with you.

Thanks,
Anne Labbe'
