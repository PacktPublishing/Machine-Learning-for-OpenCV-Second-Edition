Vince,

Mark Tawney called and said that he needs to make a salary adjustment for Joe 
Hrgovcic.   It appears that he has an outside offer.   I told him that we 
would support this, within reason, and that you would be the person to 
ultimately O.K. this request on the research side.    He is also interested 
in moving Joe out of research and formally onto the weather desk.   Again, I 
told him that it would have to be discussed with you on your return next week.

Stinson
