Dear Dr. Krishna,

As mentioned during the interviewing process, I plan to start working under
your supervision on earlier January. I'm now ready to start working with
your on Jan 8th, 2001. I have been in contact with the human resource
department to set up the working permit and relocation. I have received the
Optional Practical Training valid from Jan 8th, 2001 to Jan 7th, 2002. I
will go down to Houston to look for an apartment this weekend.
 By the way, I heard from Seksan, currently working under your supervision,
that you will be on vacation soon and will come back to work again late
January. Therefore, I would like to whether who  should I report with on my
starting date? Or do you have any recommendation for me to prepare for the
new work? Please, advise.

Best Regards,
Wichai Narongwanich
