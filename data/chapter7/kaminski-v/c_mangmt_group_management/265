I do not know who half of these people are!

My list would be:

Move Team
Susan Kennedy and Judy Schlesinger (Order all of our subscriptions)
Demonica Lipscomb (Video Scheduling - should include Stuart)
Dave Delainey 
Mail Room 
Help Desk (Our Tech is:  Doug Doring)
Facilities Help Desk (don't know who)
Marriott (Trina - she takes care of all the Lunches we order)

I don't think we need to give the Ozarka guy one, we have several
who deliver down here, it is not always the same one.

Vince probably has more, I will let you know.

Thanks!

Shirley

another major move.

There are several names boldly printed that probably will not receive the 
baskets this year.
The Christmas season is approaching therefore we must start preparing
.
Please note that I will be out on vacation Dec 13th -18th , if possible I 
would like your list of names
before my vacation begins whereby all baskets can arrive at their 
destinations on time.

                                                     
                                                                              
     Thanks
