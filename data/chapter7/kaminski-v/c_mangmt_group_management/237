Hi Samer!

Hope you had an enjoyable Thanksgiving!

I found out the "scoop" on the ticket.  It was non-refundable and non-
refundable tickets cannot be transferred.  It was just your seat that
Maureen's husband used. 

I will send in a check request for reimbursement in the amount of $330.50.
The best thing would be for you to go ahead and pay the bill or wait for
the check from us.

Sorry for the confusion!

Cheers!

Shirley

Shirley,
How are you? Things are fine over here. We are still trying to settle in;
this process seems to be taking forever.
I would like to ask for your help. I have received a statement from
American Express related to my Enron account. The charge amount is $330.50,
which is supposed to be for an airplane ticket. After calling the Travel
Agency in the Park, I found out that this was the ticket that I was
supposed to have used to fly to Colorado. However, the ticket was used by
Maurine's husband and Maurine claimed to have paid for the ticket. Also, I
remember calling the TAP and cancelling prior to the travel date. Can you
help me figure out what is going on here? I am not sure who is supposed to
pay for this. I disputed the charge before but my dispute was rejected.
I appreciate your help. Thanks.
-Samer
