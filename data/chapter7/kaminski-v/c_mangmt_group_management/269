Stinson:  Norma has checked the internal equity in the group, and Kenneth is 
fine in a senior specialist spot at that salary.  I will be happy to extend 
an offer to him.  Did you discuss anything concerning the relocation package 
with Kenneth?

Molly,

We would like to go ahead with an offer to Kenneth.    After talking to him 
again, I think he will accept.

We would like to offer him the equivalent package to an incoming Associate, 
which I understand would be $76K base and a signing bonus of $20K.

He position would be a specialist or senior specialist (whichever fits the 
salary) reporting to me.


Thanks for your help,

Stinson
