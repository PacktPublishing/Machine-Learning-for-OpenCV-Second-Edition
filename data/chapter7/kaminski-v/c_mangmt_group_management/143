Molly:  for your information, I received this reply from Anshuman today.

As I mentioned in my voicemail to you today after seeing the note from Neil 
McGregor, there is no possible way that Anshuman could be in the US to work 
on February 5th.  Until I receive all of his documents, and the necessary 
information from you regarding his position in the US, I do not have the 
information to send to the attorneys for the visa application.

Once they receive the paperwork, they will need to prepare the documents in 
triplicate, and send to me.  At this stage, I will send the documents to 
Anshuman in India and he will need to make an appointment at the US Consulate 
in order to have the L1 visa stamped into his passport.  He will not be able 
to come to the States to work without this visa in his passport!  All of this 
could take approx. 3-4 weeks to accomplish.  I think March would be a more 
realistic timeframe!

Please let me have your thoughts.
Thanks

Margaret

Anshuman:  please go ahead and complete the visa questionnaire and send the 
required documents so that I can proceed with your working visa for the US.  
Regardless of the length of time you will be in the US, you will still need 
the L1 visa in order to work here.

Many thanks
Margaret
