Thanks Vince.

Dinner on Sunday OK all round.  Do you want Anjam along too? I can't really 
ask him, given our current relationship.

One other thing, have you had thoughts on reporting lines, who signs 
expenses, etc. etc., or are these issues to be resolved when you come over?

Cheers,
Steve

Steve,

Steve, this is the spreadsheet.

Also, please, let Shirley know if the dinner on Sun is OK.
