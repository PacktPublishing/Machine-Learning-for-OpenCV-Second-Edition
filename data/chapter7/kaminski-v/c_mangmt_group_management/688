Dear all:

A few words about Tom.  He is a power engineer type who has previously worked 
at northwestern US and New Zealand utilities on various projects including 
asset planning and hydro scheduling.  He was hired by EI Structuring to 
oversee modeling efforts using SDDP, Henwood, etc. Because of the recent 
implosion at EI APACHE, Tom's group has effectively evaporated, and thus he 
is looking for a new home. He has some  finance background  from having to 
do  asset evaluation for utility rate filings.  He has almost no options 
experience.  He seems to have quite a bit of experience in some classes of OR 
problems.  

Clearly the most obvious fit is with my group, but the idea is for you all to 
see if Tom has a tool set that may be of use to other research projects.  
And, as usual, the personality fit is the other aspect to examine.

This is meant to be casual. If the consensus is positive, then I will explore 
the formalities of such a transfer.


Thanks,
Grant.
