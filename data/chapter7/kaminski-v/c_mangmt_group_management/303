Cindy,

You may or may not remember that I sent a short note to you last May 
outlining a fundraising effort for the Hansford County Library in Spearman, 
Texas.   The community was challenged to raise $20,000 which I offered to 
match 2 to 1.   With Enron foundations employee match, this grows to a total 
mathching ratio of $4 for every $1 raised by the community.  (Of course, 
because of the $15,000/year limit, I have to spread my gifts over several 
years in order to get the total amount matched by Enron.)

Sherry Benton, the librarian in Spearman just called and gave me the great 
news that the $20,000 in community donations has been achieved.   In fact, I 
expect that the total community number will come to almost $25,000 once all 
of the donations are received.

In order to recognize our part in all this, the mayor of the town is planning 
to declare October 17th as "Stinson Gibner and Enron Day" in Spearman, and 
they would like to have some public ceremony to bestow this recognition.   
There will be coverage by the local radio station and newspaper and, 
possibly, by the Amarillo newspaper as well.    

They are asking if a representative from Enron (other than myself) would be 
interested in coming to Spearman for this event.    Please let me know if you 
or anyone else would be interested in doing this.    Spearman is about a 90 
minute drive north from the airport in Amarillo, and it is possible to get 
there and back to Houston on the same day.

Thanks,

Stinson Gibner

P.S. Is there any possibility of getting a one time raise on the $15,000/year 
matching cap so that I can have $40,000 matched in just two years instead of 
three?

Cindy,  

I just received notification of Enron's match of my $8000 donation to the 
Hansford County Library in Spearman, Texas.   (All old pipeline hands know 
Spearman because both Northern Natural and Transwestern pipelines run near by 
the city.)     

You may be interested to know what I am trying to accomplish there.  The 
Library is one of the few independent public libraries in the state of Texas 
as it is owned neither by the county nor city.   It's budget is met through a 
combination of city, county, and private contributions.   A big part of their 
income comes from the "Thrift Shop,"   Spearman's version of the Blue Bird 
Circle.   In order to help the Library continue to provide quality services 
to the community (our library in Spearman, population 3000, is by all 
accounts much better than the one in nearby Perryton, population 15000),  I 
am trying to help the library establish an endowment fund.    We have set a 
goal of raising $100,000 over the next 3 years.   With Enron's matching, I am 
planning to provide about $80,000 of that amount with the other $20,000 
coming from contributions from others in the local community.

I am also investigating if the Library can get any type of matching grant 
from other foundations, but it looks like most prefer to fund specific 
projects rather than put funds towards endowments.    Let me know if you have 
any suggestions for us.


Thanks,

Stinson
