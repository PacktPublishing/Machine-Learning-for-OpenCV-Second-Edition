Hi Shalesh:

The move team has informed me that they will not be able to move your
telephone until Wednesday, the 23rd.    I have asked them to bring you
boxes by Friday, but I have not heard back from them.  Your computer
is here, but without a telehone, you may not want to move down here
until the 23rd.

Just to let you know.

Have a great day!

Shirley
