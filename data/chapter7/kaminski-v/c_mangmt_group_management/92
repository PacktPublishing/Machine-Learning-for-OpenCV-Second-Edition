I hardly know what to say!!!  What a great turnout from the Research 
Department.   We had 15 including spouses and children who worked Check-in 
and picked up trash.  Thanks so much.  Everyone from Community Relations was 
blown away by the turnout we had from Research.  I heard very nice comments 
about our effort and about the fact that Vince came out and worked.  Thanks 
again for all your support.  I personally appreciated it and I know everyone 
else from Enron that was involved in this event appreciated it because I got 
so many comments about our participation.  I don't know what else to say but 
that you are a GREAT GROUP.   Anita
