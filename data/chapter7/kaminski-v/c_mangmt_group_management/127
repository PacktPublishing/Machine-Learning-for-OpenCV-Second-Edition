Sandeep:  further to my voice mail to you today, I will meet with Anshuman at 
10:30 am and will keep his documents in a file.

However, without some type of job offer in the US, we cannot move forward 
with an L1 visa for him and if you believe he will not be returning to the US 
to work, then we really do not need to get him the L1 at this time.

If the circumstances change, please let me know.

Margaret

Margaret,

Please find attached the resume of Anshuman, as well as the form needed for 
L-1 visa, duly filled in.

Copies of all required material for the visa, has already been put into 
inter-office mail.

Please do call me at 713-857-6826.  I want to reschedule today's meeting for 
another time, since we are working on a deadline here.

Regards,
Sandeep.
