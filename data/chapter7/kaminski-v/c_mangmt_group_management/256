Jeff,

I want to bring  Aram Sogomonian back to Enron at a VP level.
According to new human resources procedures this decision requires
a support of three senior executives.

I want to ask you to express your opinion on Aram (based on a phone interview
or just on your past interactions with him). You can send a reply to Norma 
Villarreal at H/R.

Thanks.

Vince
