Kevin,

I think it's very important.
It is important that our work area looks neat.

Hello Vince ,
Vince , before I get with Delores on the matter of the
department I wanted to ask you how important it
 that we get the walls repaired ?
Is the Research Department satisfactory or is
there anything else that i can do ?

                         Thanks
                        Kevin Moore
