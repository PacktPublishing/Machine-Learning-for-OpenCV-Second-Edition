Grant,  I did talk with Tanya this evening however since I'm on vacation 
Friday I wanted to outline here what Rabi has discussed with me.

1)  Title.....he is currently at a VP level and we are offering him Manager
2)  Sign on Bonus...........the 15K is not coving the lost bonus he will 
receive at he current co ($25K)
3)  Salary...........he will receive a "Risk Premium" of approx 10% befor 
tax.   He is not able to quantify this for us and I was not able to get a 
number out of him as to what he is looking for.  

He is very enthusiastic and wants to work for Enron but wanted to see if we 
could do anything to enhance our offer in these areas.

Toni
