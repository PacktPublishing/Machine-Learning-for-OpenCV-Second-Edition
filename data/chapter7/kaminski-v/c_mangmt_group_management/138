Stinson-

Looks like we're in, to split the costs of the class with you. George will 
contact you soon.

George-

Here's the story.

Research forwarded to their personnel a solicitation they received for JAVA 
training by an outside person, weeklong classes for true Beginners and for 
those with decent programming experience in other languages (esp C++). Vince 
had pre-agreed tlo pay for it for anyone who wanted it. But, the response 
they got was so "overwhelming" they reconsidered, for financial reasons, and 
decided it would be better to just hire a Professor to teach a class for a 
week here. The costs would be around $15,000, and there should be room for 
around 15 people in the class. They have 6-8 people, and wonder if we might 
have some people who would want to do it (a no-brainer- JAVA is a big-time 
resume pad these days) and would be willing to share the costs with them. 
What is your opinion on this? Personally, I think it's a relatively 
inexpensive investment in our people, although, selfishly, it does increase 
their 'market value' so to speak. (Of course, nothing keeps Directors from 
going to the class as well :))
