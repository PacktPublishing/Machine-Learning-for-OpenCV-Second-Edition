Tanya,

Yes, we were talking about Wednesday.  My mistake.
Wednesday, April 19 works for me. Let's do it then.

Shirley,
here is the list of people who is going to attend this lunch:
Credit: Bill Bradford, Tanya Rohauer, Debbie Bracket (3);
Research: Vince Kaminski, Grant Masson, Vincent Tang, Tanya Tamarchenko (4);
IT: Jonathan Le, Ganapathy Ramesh, Winston Jia, Virendra Patel, Andrew 
Champion
 (and may be a few more, Jonathan promised to get back with me with the 
headcount);
Risk Control: Rudi Zipter, Ted Murphy (2).

I understand that we were going to go not on 14th, but next week.

Vince: would you like to do it on Wednesday, April 19, or Friday, April 21?
Shirley, can you, please, make a reservation after Vince's reply?

Thank you,

Tanya.

Tanya,

Can you coordinate, in my absence, the lunch with IT
and credit.

We need the body count and reservation at the restaurant for the 14th.
