Celeste,

I am recommending Jason Sokolov for summer internship with Enron.
Jason is currently working part-time for Mike Roberts and makes
very valuable contribution  to a number on-going projects.

We are very happy with his performance and see him as a valuable future
Enron employee.

Vince

Vince:

As we discussed earlier, I attached the copy of the petition for my summer 
internship with Enron Analyst and Associate group.
I also have the hard copy of the letter, which I will deliver to you 
presonally.

I am looking forward to, finally, become an official Enron employee.  Thank 
you very much for your valuable contributions to
my experience with the company.

Jason Sokolov
