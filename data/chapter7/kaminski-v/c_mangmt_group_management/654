Congratulations!  Please take whatever time is necessary. 
I hope the complications are only with the in-laws and not the police / U.S. 
immigration, etc.
Let me know if there is anything we can do for you.  


Regards,
Grant.

Hi, Grant,

How are you?  Hope everything is going well.

My wedding ceremony was very good but the whole
process is more complex than I expected.  It might
take several more days.  So I am wondering, if it is
not too much a trouble for you, I would like to extend
my vacation several more days.  Please let me know.

Best regards,

Vincent
