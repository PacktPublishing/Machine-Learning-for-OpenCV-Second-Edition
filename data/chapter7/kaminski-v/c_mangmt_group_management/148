Molly,

Thanks for the update. Two points.

Please, let Neil McGregor know that many possible proposals were floated
with regard to Anshuman and there was some noise in the system.
We need L1 visa anyway and we decided to go ahead an arrange it.
I shall also write to him and explain the confusion.

Also, if I have the choice between upsetting Neil or Jeffs (Shankman and 
Skilling),
I shall choose Neil.

Vince:  Apparently Neil McGregor became upset when he received Margaret 
Daffin's email.    He is saying, however, that Anshuman will only be in 
Houston for one month, and you had mentioned six months when we spoke 
earlier.   It really doesn't make any difference since he will need to get an 
L1 visa under either circumstance, but I thought you might want to see his 
email.

Anshuman is not moving or immigrating to the US. We are allowing him to work 
for a 1month assignment in the US with Enron. Please carry out the necessary 
approvals and visa's on this basis.
