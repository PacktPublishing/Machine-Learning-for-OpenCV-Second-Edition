> * Profile: Munich Re - Giant steps forward
>    Munich Re has kept as silent as a statue for many
> years - even when confronted with the most innocent enquiries about its
> strategy. But now the statue has come to life and is willing to talk about
> how it maintains its position as the world's most powerful reinsurer.

> * Financial risks: The path to new risks
