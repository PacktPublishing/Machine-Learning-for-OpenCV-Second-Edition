Hello--Listen, wanted to make sure you received a copy of our newest 
publication last week, The Risk Desk. Because of the size of the files we 
sent out, quite a few bounced back because some corp firewalls halt emails 
over a certain size. Anyhow, if you didn't receive the issue, hit the reply 
button and type "resend Risk Desk." Responce so far has been great for those 
of you that received the free copy -- we think you'll agree that it's soon to 
become the leading "must read" publication on market, credit, price and 
operational risk management in the energy space. 
Also, just a reminder, the charter price for a one year subscription ($199) 
ends soon. Let us know.
