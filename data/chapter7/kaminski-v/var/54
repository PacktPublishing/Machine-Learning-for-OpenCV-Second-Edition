Tanya,
            The exponentials we tried earlier (a+bexp(-cx), etc, fit well b=
ut=20
gave negative numbers in the bootstrapping.
            I tried a + b(t+c)(-1) , a standard power law, and as the ?acco=
mpanying graph shows (for the 12 months), the fits are quite good.?        =
    In this case, the ffvols do not become negative (I believe this ?corres=
ponds to your 0 beta).  ?  I would have preferred exp(-t) and variants (can=
 explain owing to ?mean-reverting vols), but the power law might be a pract=
ical alternative ?(from an implementation standpoint).?Naveen??? ?????Tanya=
