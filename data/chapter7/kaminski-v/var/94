Dear all,

I am leaving the office now, and sending you the preliminary model 1a for MG 
Metals VaR that Tanya, Cantekin, Kirstee have put together.  We are now in a 
position to look at the VaR by metal for positions as of 19th July 2000, 
subject to some data that needs updating/correcting; we still need to update 
some information/data flow processes as follows:-

i) Factor Loadings for silver, gold, cocoa beans and TC (treatment charge for 
copper concentrate)
ii) Check correlations between Nickel and Alu and Nickel and Copper (I got 
different answers to Houston)
iii) Ensure latest forward price curves are included (perhaps through live 
link to Telerate/Reuters)
iiia) Price for silver is wrong (units should be $ per troy ounce), and 
similarly for gold (price should be $ per troy ounce), also we need cocoa 
bean forward curve
iv) Find a better way to extract positional information from MG Metals/link 
to the spreadsheet in an automated fashion
v) Add "minor" metals like cobalt, palladium, platinum, cadmium etc. (N.B. we 
have 1,093 troy ounces of palladium short posn and 3,472 troy ounces platinum 
long as of 19th July)

Please feel free to add to this list if I have missed anything; I believe 
that we have most of the bases covered in respect of issues to resolve ahead 
of the deadline of 7th August and fully expect that we will deliver.

Regards,

Anjam Ahmad

P.S. The DLL the spreadsheet requires is in 
O:\Research\Common\from_vsh\Value@Risk\Ccode\Debug\varcsnl.dll -> most of you 
have access to this.
