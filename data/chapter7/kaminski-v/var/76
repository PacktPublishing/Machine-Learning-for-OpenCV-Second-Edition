Tariff VAR Project Kick-off Meeting

Time: 8/3; 2-3 pm
Location: EB612

==============================================================================
=============
Per the 8/2 lunch meeting between Research, RAC, and the Tariff Group, there 
developed a consensus to:

Develop a high level Value-at-Risk model within a 4-8 week time frame to use 
for initial risk measurement and hedging purposes
Accommodate links for critical variables such as Interest Rates, Load Growth, 
and inflation
Provide "knobs" for less quantifiable factors such as rate case frequency, 
rate methodology, etc.
Collaborate with the tariff forecasting team, to have consistent assumptions 
and logic.

Proposed agenda for our meeting:

Discuss the relationship of this project to other ongoing projects
Review existing T&D forecast model (decide whether it's a starting point or 
not - attached for your review)
Discuss approach (methodology and technology)
Assign responsibilities
Develop project guidelines and timeline
