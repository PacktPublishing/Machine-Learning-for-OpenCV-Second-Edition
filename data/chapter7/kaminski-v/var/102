Hi Tanya,

Attached are the live Reuters-linked volatility curves.  Please don't 
re-establish links, as I don't think that your Telerate connection works in 
the same way as ours in London.  I will get back to you on cleaning up the 
historical forward curve database as I complete each metal.  We can talk at 
5pm as we agreed.

Regards,

Anjam

P.S. I think the fast dial is: 830 5383 or 830 35383
