Vince,
Have you seen the latest version of our article?  In a nutshell, it
establishes both what's right and what's wrong with r-squared/regression.
Essentially, r-squared is fine PROVIDED that the amount of the derivative
optimal, but otherwise it makes little sense.
Please let me know what you think about this.
Regards,
Andy
