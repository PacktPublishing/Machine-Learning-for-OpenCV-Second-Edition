Rick,

I was contacted by Petronas who requested a meeting
with Enron on risk  management. I have met with them
a few  years ago and they want to discuss with us 
their progress implementing risk management practices.

Can we arrange for them a standard presentation, like the one we have for 
banks
(you or David Port, Bill Bradford, research)?

Unfortunately, they gave us no choice as far as the timing is concerned
(given a very tight schedule). They want to visit on Thursday, Feb.  8,
at 10 a.m. I shall take them out to lunch after the meeting.

I shall also contact Jeff Shankman and John Nowlan
to arrange a short courtesy meeting with them.

Vince
