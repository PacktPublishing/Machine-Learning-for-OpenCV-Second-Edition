Good afternoon John,

I hope things are well with you.  I am writing to update you on the status of 
your meetings with Andy Fastow, Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling.  I have arranged 
the following meeting dates and times with Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling, (I am 
still trying to work with Andy Fastow's schedule):

Jeff Skilling
December 4th  
2:00 - 3:00 p.m.

Ken Lay
December 4th
3:30 - 4:30 p.m.

Also, I will attempt to schedule the meeting with Andy Fastow for December 
4th for convenience - this will also allow us to possibly schedule additional 
meetings for the 5th (as needed).  I will let you know as soon as I'm 
successful.

Regards,

Cindy Derecskey
