Shmuel,

I hope you remember me. I visited you together with Aram Sogomonian, a
good friend of mine, a few years ago. I am currently responsible, among
other things, for recruiting graduates with finance and/or technical
backgrounds at the University of Berkeley. I would be glad to give you a
call and talk more about the details of our program. My colleague,
AshleyBaxter, from the Analyst/Associate Program at Enron would join me
as well.

I am sending you a copy of the brochure about the Analyst / Associate
Program.

Vince Kaminski
