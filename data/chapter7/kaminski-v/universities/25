Howard,

Sorry for the delay.

I shall be able to get back to you next week. A very interesting new research 
idea came up
and we have to close a few loops internally.

Hi Vince:

Just a short note to indicate that we have not heard received any information 
from your group since our discussion at Wharton in February. We look forward 
to get some information on what issues you would like us to spend some time 
thinking about.

Hope all is well.

Regards,

Howard
