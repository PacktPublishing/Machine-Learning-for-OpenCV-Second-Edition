                                 The mission of the Wharton Risk Management 
and Decision Processes Center is to carry
                                 out a program of basic and applied research 
to promote effective policies and programs for
                                 low-probability events with potentially 
catastrophic consequences. The Center is especially
                                 concerned with natural and technological 
hazards and with the integration of industrial risk
                                 management policies with insurance. The 
Center is also concerned with promoting a
                                 dialogue among industry, government, 
interest groups and academics through its research
                                 and policy publications and through 
sponsored workshops, roundtables and forums.
