One of the most important trends in the energy industry during the last yea=
r=20
was proliferation of electronic, Internet based, trading platforms for=20
wholesale markets and for retail operations. Websites such as=20
www.houstonstreet.com and www.altranet.com provide facilities for matching=
=20
buyers and sellers. The website operated by Enron Corp. (EnronOnline)=20
represents an alternative solution under which Enron acts as a principal in=
=20
every transaction. On the retail? side, many retail e-commerce companies=20
offering auctions, reverse auctions and platforms for creation of buyers=01=
,=20
clubs challenge incumbent utilities. The objective of this project is to=20
evaluate the impact of e-commerce (both at the wholesale and retail levels)=
=20
on the energy industry. The study will start with comparative analysis of=
=20
different wholesale trading and retail e-commerce business models and=20
evaluation of their long-term viability. The next step will be assessment o=
f=20
the impact of e-commerce on price dynamics, profit margins and the level of=
=20
competition in different energy markets. A separate section will be devoted=
=20
to analysis of reaction of companies and organizations affected by e-commer=
ce=20
(incumbent utilities, organized exchanges, energy brokers) to the new=20
competitive threat, and different strategies they implement to meet the=20
challenge. Organized exchanges have accelerated in many cases the transitio=
n=20
to screen-based trading that has been already replacing open outcry=20
technology. Power and natural gas marketers have created alliances (with=20
other industry players, software companies and electronic exchanges) to=20
create their own trading platforms. Gas and electric utilities embarked on=
=20
development of vertical and horizontal e-commerce platforms, offering=20
services to households and other companies in the energy industry. The=20
critical question is how quickly different companies should react to the=20
competitive threats and how fast they should exploit opportunities created =
by=20
the Internet based economy. It's quite obvious that the Internet revolution=
=20
will change the energy industry's landscape during the next few years. The=
=20
objective of the project is to provide answers to the questions posed above=
,=20
based on the currently available information. Additionally, the participant=
s=20
should come up with fallback strategies the energy companies should impleme=
nt=20
in case the currently? expected trends fail to materialize. =20
