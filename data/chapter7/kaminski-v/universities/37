Hi Melinda!

We need to get this to John Henderson, but he did not come up on my eMail.  
Otherwise, likely any manager level at New Power would know.  Any help in 
forwarding would be great!  Thanks!

Hi Christie and Vince,

We really look forward to seeing you all next week.  We've learned a lot 
working on this project, and think we will provide some useful information 
for you.

If possible, we need to know what states NewPower is operating in.  
Specifically, what states there is a current marketing campaign?  Should I 
ask Melinda McCarty for this information?

Thanks again for your help.

Regards,

Tiger Team 3
