Frank,

We shall have about 30 people, highly technical (Ph.D.,  M.S. level).
A presentation of 45 minutes would be optimal, assuming you may arrive 
around 11:45 - 12:00.


We shall get the projector for you.

Please, keep all the receipts for refund.

Vince

Excellent, Vince!  Yes, I will be happy to make a presentation.  Do you have a
projector to which I could simply hook up my laptop?  Could we also have an
overhead projector as a backup?  Many thanks, Frank
P.S.  How long is optimal?  How large an audience and what are the
participants' backgrounds?
