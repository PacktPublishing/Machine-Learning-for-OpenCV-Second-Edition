Did you get the below email from Jim Garven?

Would you be able to stay over and speak at the Risk Management Fraternity
and perhaps come in a day early and speak to his students?

Shirley

Dear Ms. Crenshaw,

On November 28, I sent Vince Kaminski an email inviting him to visit Baylor 
University (where I now hold an appointment as Professor of Finance & 
Insurance; having resigned from LSU this pas spring).? I have yet to receive 
a reply from him.? Can you bring this email (copied below) to his attention?

Thanks,

Jim Garven

===========================

Dear Vince,

Since we last corresponded, I have left LSU and am now Professor of Finance & 
Insurance at Baylor University in Waco, TX. My colleague at Baylor, John 
Martin, mentioned that you will be coming to campus for a conference on 
Friday, February 23 that he is organizing. I am curious whether your schedule 
might permit staying over that evening so that we can feature you as our 
dinner speaker for the chartering ceremony of Gamma Iota Sigma, a national 
risk management fraternity. For that matter, would you also possibly be 
available to make any presentations to undergraduate and graduate students on 
the previous day (Thursday, February 22)? What I have in mind is a 
presentation similar to the presentations you made last spring to my LSU 
classes. 

Thank you for your consideration of this request. I am looking forward to 
seeing you once again. 

Sincerely,

Jim Garven
