Doug, FYI

I'm sure that Baldick would just as soon sell us energy as AE.  Plus we have 
a better handle on market opportunites.  See his e-mail below.

Dear Lance,
 The University is predicting a shortfall due to increased
gas costs of between $30 and $40 million, over the next 1 to 2
years.  For a long time, I have been wanting to explore opportunities for
the
campus to sell energy to Austin Energy when its load is below
peak.  This big shortfall provides an impetus for the university
to want to maximize the value of its plant.
 
 Ross
