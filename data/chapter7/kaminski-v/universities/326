Vince,

Thank you for forwarding the following messages.  I am sorry that I am just 
now getting back to you, my lotus notes was down all afternoon yesterday. 

We currently have the Cal Berkeley General Presentation set for Wednesday, 
October 18th at 7:00 p.m. which works out well because it is just prior to 
the time deadline for students to submit their resumes.  The General 
Presentation is a general overview of Enron, the Program, the interview 
process, as well as a chance for students to meet and chat with Enron reps.  
Since this is the first year that we are recruiting from Cal Berkeley, I 
think that it is important that I attend this event on campus so that I can 
answer any interview process questions.  I will check the schedule and see if 
it is possible to move the presentation to the 23rd.  The only negative is 
that I will not be able to attend because I will be conducting interviews at 
Rice that day.  Also, it is very difficult to find a location to hold the 
presentation, and I need to check on location availability on the 23rd.

However, I do think that we should take advantage of the seminar on campus.  
This may mean that they are two seperate trips to campus.  Perhaps, we can 
also set up some other presentations for the 23rd or even the Monday prior.  
Although I would like to be able to attend the class/seminar presentations, I 
don't think that it is as vital as the General Presentation.

What are your thoughts?

Thanks,
Ashley

Shmuel,

Thanks for the message. I am working with our recruiter, Ashley Baxter,
to finalize the date of the trip. I shall shoot for October the 23rd
if this date works for the rest of our team.

Vince

Dear Vince.
I sent you a reply earlier this month but I haven't heard from you about the
date of your visit. Our department has a Seminar every Monday. If you can
schedule your visit on a Monday I would like to invite you to give a seminar
which will be attended by many of our graduate students and faculty and will
give you an opportunity to tell them about your program. With sufficient
lead-time I can advertise the seminar in the Hass school to their financial
engineering students.
Shmuel.
