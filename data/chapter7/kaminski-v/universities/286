Vince, I am checking the date on Jeff's calendar (I'm assuming the date is 
February 22?).  I am holding that date whole week for a trip abroad, but I 
think we have some flexibility on that and am checking it out.  I'll be back 
in touch as soon as I've resolved that.  SRS

Jeff,

Our friends at the University of Texas are planning a conference on energy
economics and finance in February of next year. They would like very much to 
have 
you as a keynote speaker. 

Given our good, long-term  relationship with UT,  I would recommend
that you speak at this conference. I talked to Prof. Ehud Ronn
a few times about the program and  I think that this will be 
an excellent forum to present Enron's accomplishments and
agenda for the future.

I am sure that Rick Causey will join me in making the same recommendation.

Vince
