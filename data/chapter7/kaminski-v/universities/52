Dr. Lu,

I would be grateful if I could talk with you some time about the typical
terms one sees in Swing, take or pay, virtual storage, etc. options.  This
is related to some research some colleagues and I are doing applying recent
innovations in Monte Carlo valuation of options with early exercise.  We
would like to illustrate our techniques on some examples which look
realistic.  When would be convenient for you?

I look forward to talking with you.
Duane Seppi
