Christie and Vince:

On behalf of Enron Team 1, we would like to thank you for being such gracious 
hosts.  The trip far exceeded our expectations and we appreciate the fact 
that so many people took time out of their busy schedules to meet with us.  A 
special thanks to the both of you for spending all day Friday with us.  We 
look forward to our telephone conference on Thursday and to working with you 
in the future.
