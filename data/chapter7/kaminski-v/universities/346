Jeff:  Good talking with you earlier this week and happy to hear that your 
conversation with Jeff Skilling was such a positive one.  I am looking 
forward to working with you, Vince and Mark Palmer in the near future to put 
in place a comprehensive plan to maximize the Enron/Wharton relationship in a 
number of different areas.  I also know that a number of the faculty will be 
extremely pleased to learn of this news and will be quick to get the ball 
rolling.

As promised, I am forwarding a document outlining all on campus sponsorship 
opportunities, minus the Student Business Plan Competition, for the upcoming 
School year.  Please review and pass it on the Celeste Roberts, for whom I do 
not have an accurate e-mail address.  There are a number of student 
conferences that you may wish to consider participating in as a means for 
getting the Enron name in front of them.  Please don't hesitate to contact me 
with any questions you may have or requests for additional information.

I will also contact the Career Management Office and ask that they call 
Celeste to discuss career orientation panel sessions.  I know that you must 
plan your schedule well in advance and will do my best to facilitate that 
process.

Thanks again for all you are doing to bring our two institutions together.  
It is important and makes a big difference.

Look forward to hearing from you soon.

TOM
