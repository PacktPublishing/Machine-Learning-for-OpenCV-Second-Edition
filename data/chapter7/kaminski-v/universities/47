Dear Ms. Patrick,
 
Anne Stamer asked me to contact you  regarding Enron providing a judge for 
Phase III of the Business Plan  Competition.  Phase III judges are generally 
Partner-level individuals at  venture capital firms, Managing Directors from 
investment banks, or other  senior individuals who have extensive experience 
assessing and working with  early stage ventures.  A Phase III judge will 
receive five business plans,  with the entire judging process requiring 4-5 
hours during the weeks of April 2  and April 9.  I am attaching a document 
that describes the competition and  judging procedures for Phase III in more 
detail.  We are looking to  finalize the list of Phase III judges by March 
23, so if you could please  forward either Anne or I the name of the 
appropriate individual, we can contact  them directly with more details.  
Please let me know if you have further  questions and we appreciate your 
support of the Competition.
 
Sincerely,
 
Andrew  Gaffney
