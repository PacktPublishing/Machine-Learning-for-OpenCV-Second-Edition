Vince,

This is my latest effort and I would appreciate your thoughts.  I know that
we haven't written together before so let me assure me that you will not
hurt my feelings by "slashing away" with a red pen.  I think that I have
put all the clay on the table for this piece of sculpture but it is still
pretty crude.  Help me "refine" the work to create something we can both be
very proud of.

By the way, I know you are extremely busy right now so don't feel pressured
to spend lots of time here.  Any guidance you can offer will be
appreciated.  I don't know what the editor's time schedule is but he asked
me to send him a draft on Monday.  You and I will still be able to edit the
manuscript but he will begin reading and editing it too.  I'll let you know
as soon as I have a final deadline.

Your friend,

John

p.s. Hope life is a bit calmer for you.  By the way, I'm reading an
interesting book entitled "The Four Agreements" by Miguel Ruiz that
documents the Toltec philosophy of life in the context of the dreams of
reality that we all create.  You might enjoy it.
