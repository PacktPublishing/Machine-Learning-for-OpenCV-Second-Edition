Ian,

Sorry for a delay in getting back to you.
I have one challenge I did not anticipate
when I talked to you  the first time about our Real Options
internal seminar.

The materials were prepared in collaboration with a professor
from another school, and there is some  sensitivity regarding
the intellectual property rights and the ability to distribute the
materials
outside Enron.

Please, give me some time to find out if I can work
around this issue.

Vince

I still have not heard from your lawyer.  I would like to see whar
materials you are using and assess how we could work on the topic of real
options with Enron
