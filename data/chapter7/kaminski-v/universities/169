Christie,

     Thanks again for taking the time to visit Wharton and share about Enron 
and our upcoming project.  I know each of us is excited about the opportunity 
to learn and contribute to Enron.  Specifically, thank you for the awesome 
dinner at the Palladium.  It was a great way to get to know you, Visant, and 
Vince better.
     I look forward to visiting Houston in January.  Please let me know if 
you need any additional information with regard to the trip.  Have a great 
holiday season, and I look forward to seeing each of you in January.

Sincerely,
Jason Cummins

Hi evryone!

Vince, Vasant and I are very excited about the Tiger Project!  We all
thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to meet with such an incredibly
interesting, enthusiastic and intelligent group.  Thank you for your
time!

For those interested in the Houston trip on January 18-19th, please let
me
know by the 15th of December so that I can get the best deal on air fare
(one-month in advance).

Also, I'll be forwarding the Enron information packages to Donna Piazze
for
your receipt next week.  I am including Jeff Shankman in this reply, as
Jeff is a Wharton grad, leader of one of our Enron business units, and
one
of the most enthusiastic Enron/Wharton cheerleaders.

Please feel free to individually contact me if there is anything I can
do
for any of you.

Thanks again for your enthusiastic interest in Enron!

--Christie.
