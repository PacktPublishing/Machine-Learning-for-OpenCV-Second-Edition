Thanks for your message. A call sometimes between 7:00 and 8:00
is fine. I come to the office around 7:00 traffic permitting.

Vince

Dear Mr. Kaminsky,

Mr. Bryant informed me of the possibility of having you as a guest speaker
for our speaker series. It would be a great honor and a pleasure for me to
help you organize a trip to Pittsburgh. Would it be possible to give you a
call tomorrow (thursday) at 7.00am central time?

Sincerely,


Pierre-Philippe Ste-marie
