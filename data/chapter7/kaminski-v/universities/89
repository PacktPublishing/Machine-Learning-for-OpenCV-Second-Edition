Donna, I had also passed along the resumes of two Reliant Energy Tiger Team
members, David Gershenson and James Iker, who were both interested in
working for Enron this summer. I had spoken to Vince about these candidates
when we were in Houston, and he said he would arrange internships for them
as well.
He should already have copies of their resumes and cover letters. Please let
me know if you have any questions or need clarification.

Thanks!!
Vincent
