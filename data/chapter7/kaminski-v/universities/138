Dear Mr. Kaminski

Please excuse the cancellation due to illness.  The students do not care
who
they infect near the end of the semester, they just want to get done!

Here is my available schedule for next year.  I am now overloaded next week
with tasks to complete the semester.  I do hope that we can reschedule
during the first quarter next year.

I would note that my schedule is most free for Thursday or Friday.  I could
fly out late Wednesday night.

Cordially,

Gerry
