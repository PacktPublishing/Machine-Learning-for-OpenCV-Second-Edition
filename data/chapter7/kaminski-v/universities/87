Vince,

Attached is a copy of the typeset version that I will be reading today.  I
will check to make sure that all the changes you gave me this weekend are
incorporated.  I will also be writing a 200 word summary for the paper
today and will pass that by you as well.

Have a great day.

john

p.s. I'll call Shirley about the revenue question I sent you yesterday.
