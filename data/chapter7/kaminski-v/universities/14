Hi!

Attached please find the Itinerary for the Harvard---NYU trip; please 
disregard any parts of the trip that don't apply to you.

If I have not already done so, I'll try this morning to get you a copy of the 
Enron OnLine case being taught at Harvard tomorrow (Thursday).  Otherwise, 
I'll give it to you on the plane--it's fewer than 15 pages, so it's a quick 
read.

Please call me if you have any questions (3-6117).  Otherwise, I'll see you 
at the corporate hangar at 6pm. 

(For anyone unfamiliar with the location of the corporate hangar, I believe 
you can get a map/address/directions from the Enron Aviation department.)

Thanks!

--Christie.
