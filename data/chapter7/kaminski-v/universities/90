Vince,

I got the zipped version fine.  Thanks  The only outstanding items relate
to the complete references for your papers (the book publisher and dates).
I spoke with Shirley this morning and she is tracing this down for me.

I re-read the Gas Market paper segment on the take-or-pay contracts and
corrected my "oversight".  By the end of the day I hope to have all the
corrections that you gave me incorporated in the manuscript.  We will make
them on the galley pages of the article when it arrives.

thanks again for all your help.

John

p.s. I also spoke with Mary Joyce (she returned my earlier call a week ago
when I was trying to ask Cindy something).  All is well.  At 10:15 AM
