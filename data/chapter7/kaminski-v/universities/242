I promise we will do everything we can.  Right now Kristin's assistant, Alyse 
Herasimchuk,  has a call the Cornell career office to put him on the 
schedule.  If that doesn't work, Kristin will ask for the interviewers to 
stay longer to interview him.  Will let you know as soon as we do. 

Thanks for everything you do for us.

Alison

Alison,

I appreciate it. I really need your help on this one. His father is very 
helpful in my recruiting 
efforts at Berkeley.

CORRECTION - I was going too fast last night ( You said Cornell not Carneige 
Mellon). Cornell interviews are Monday, October 30 & Tuesday, October 31.  We 
are faxing Shmuel Oren's resume to Kristin and checking to see if  there is 
any time on the closed schedule, or if the interviewers will stay longer to 
include him.  I will let you know today if we can make it work.

Sorry my first e-mail was incorrect.

Charlene,

Please, help. This is a son of a professor at Berkeley who helps me a lot in 
the recruiting process.
His son goes to Cornell. Can we invite him (the son, not the professor) to a 
Super Saturday? I really want
to repay the debt to his father who is very instrumental in  my recruiting 
efforts.

Vince
