Shmuel,

Thanks for the message. I am working with our recruiter, Ashley Baxter,
to finalize the date of the trip. I shall shoot for October the 23rd
if this date works for the rest of our team.

Vince

Dear Vince.
I sent you a reply earlier this month but I haven't heard from you about the
date of your visit. Our department has a Seminar every Monday. If you can
schedule your visit on a Monday I would like to invite you to give a seminar
which will be attended by many of our graduate students and faculty and will
give you an opportunity to tell them about your program. With sufficient
lead-time I can advertise the seminar in the Hass school to their financial
engineering students.
Shmuel.
