Hi Donna!

I'll let you know ASAP about 3/22.  I believe Vince will be in London on that 
date.

More immediately, is there a conference call tomorrow (Thursday)?  If so, is 
there a call in number established, or does Melinda set this up?  (She's out 
this afternoon).

Thanks!

--Christie.

Christie:

Professor Ravi Aron, Wharton, has been a consultant to the student Tiger
Team for the Enron project.  At his suggestion and invitation, Tiger
students have been invited to attend an e-Commerce Executive Education
seminar that is directly related to the project on which they are working.
Professor Aron will be giving the session on pricing mechanisms and B2B
market auctions.  This will take place at the Steinberg Conference Center on
campus on Thursday, March 22 from 8:30a-12:30.  We would also like to extend
an invitation for a representative from Enron to attend.

Please let me know if you or someone who has worked with the student teams
will be able to attend the seminar.

We look forward to seeing you and Vince at the final presentation on April 3
from 4:30-7:30pm in Vance Hall B6.

Regards,
Donna
