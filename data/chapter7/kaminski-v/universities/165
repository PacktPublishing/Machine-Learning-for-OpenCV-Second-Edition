This is regarding the risk management project.

Hi Shirley!

I'll be on vacation, but will be Happy to call in at that time, or any other 
time that is convenient for Vince.  Should we also include Jeff Shankman?

Please let me know the time and telephone number to call, and I'll be there!

Thanks!

--Christie.
