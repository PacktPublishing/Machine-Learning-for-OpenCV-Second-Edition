Kim,

I spoke with Bill Bradford, VP in Enron's Credit Department, and he offered 
to field your questions regarding Credit.  He will be in the office this 
week.  You can call him at 713-853-3831.  

Regarding Nymex traders, what kind of trader are you interested in?  Larry 
Gagliardi trades Nymex crude products.  Let me know if you need his number 
again, or if you think someone else would be more helpful.

good luck

ken

Could you get us the name of the contact who trades directly with Nymex?
