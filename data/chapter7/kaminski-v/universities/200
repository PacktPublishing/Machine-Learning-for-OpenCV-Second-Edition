Vince,
We have not started our spring hiring yet.  However, we will review and let 
him know we have an interest and tell him when we will be interviewing on 
campus.  Thanks

Althea and Shelly,
Please keep track of his resume so that he is considered for a summer 
position when we begin the spring recruiting.  Thanks

Hello Charlene,

I am forwarding you a resume of a student from Berkeley. 
We would  like very much to have him as a summer intern with my group.

Please, let me know if your program can accommodate him.

Vince

Dear Mr. Kaminski

I am currently pursuing the M.S. in IEOR at UC Berkeley. I attended the 
speech you gave some weeks ago.

I am interested in summer internship positions available in Enron. You will 
find enclosed my resume.

Sincerely,

Ezequiel Luis
