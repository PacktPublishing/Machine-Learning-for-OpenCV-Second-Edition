Vince:

I did get your phone message about the summer, but I still haven't heard from 
Enron about an offer for summer employment.  I do have other offers with 
other energy companies that I must respond to this week.  Could you let me 
know as soon as possible if an offer will be made to me.

Sincerely,
Kimberly Whitsel
