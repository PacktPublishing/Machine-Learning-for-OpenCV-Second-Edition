Hi Jeff!

I know you received the information below.  Additionally, I have 2 people 
from Broadband Services meeting us there Friday (one is Traci Warner who set 
up the Rice U deal). Further, I'll be meeting with Amy Briggs regarding the 
Entrepeneurship Conference Nov 30th and Dec 1st.  I've already spoken with 
her and Tom Piazze and both independently confirmed as you suspected that we 
committed to sponsor at the $10,000 level.  This entitles us to Banners, 
panels, posters, and most importantly, a Keynote address.  I'll discuss the 
keynote address with her but would appreciate your thoughts in advance as to 
how you'd like to see the Keynote speech executed (suggestions for topics, 
proposed speaking candidates, when in the conference you'd like to see 
Enron's speech, etc). I'll review the trip with you when we return.

Thanks Jeff!

--Christie.
