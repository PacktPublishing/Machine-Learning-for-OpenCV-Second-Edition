Subject: recommendation of an outstanding Baylor MBA student for summer  
internship


Dear Stinson,

I would like to call your attention to Rusty Parks, who is an MBA student 
here and has been serving as my research assistant since last fall.? Rusty is 
a very outstanding individual with a very impressive work ethic and interest 
in topics such as financial engineering and technology, particularly as these 
issues pertain to the energy industry.?? In fact, you met Rusty during your 
recent visit to Baylor (specifically, last month over dinner at the Gamma 
Iota Sigma chartering  ceremony).

I happen to know that Rusty is already scheduled to visit Enron for an 
interview for a summer internship on April 19.? He has been invited by Althea 
Gordon.? If there is any possibility that you could meet with him during his 
visit, I am sure that he would be most grateful.?  Rusty is one of the very 
best research assistants I have ever had, and I am sure that Enron would 
benefit from having him aboard during the coming summer. 

Sincerely,

Jim Garven

P.S.: Please find Rusty's resume attached to this email.
