Pierre-Philippe,

with me
but want to confirm it.

A Measurement Framework for Bank Liquidity  Risk 
September 15, 2000
Raymond Cote
Vice  President, FinRad Inc.

Raymond Cote is Vice President, Financial  Engineering at FinRad Inc., a 
Montreal-based consulting firm offering financial  management solutions that 
combine advisory and systems development services to  &corporations and 
financial institutions.

Abstract:

Liquidity  risk, as opposed to credit and market risks, has received little 
attention in  professional or academic journals. We argue that analyzing bank 
liquidity risk  can be viewed as a variation of credit risk analysis. After 
introducing some  concepts and definitions, the presentation defines a 
framework allowing to  measure a bank's structural liquidity risk. It then 
shows that combining the  framework with modern credit risk measurement tools 
leads to a liquidity risk  VAR measure. The presentation then offers 
concluding comments on the integration  of the liquidity risk measurement 
framework within enterprise-wide risk  management.
