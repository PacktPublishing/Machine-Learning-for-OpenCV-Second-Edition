Recruiting Season is quickly approaching and I wanted to go ahead and make 
everyone aware of the first event at Cal Berkely this Fall.  The Cal Berkeley 
Career Fair will take place on Friday, September 8th.  We would like to take 
three representatives on campus to discuss the Analyst Program as well as the 
Global Technology Track.  Travel arrangements would involve leaving on 
Thursday evening, September 7th, to recruit on campus all day Friday.  If you 
think that you may be available to help with this event, please click on the 
button below.




We will discuss this and other events/dates on campus this Fall during the 
Team Meeting on Tuesday, August 29th at 2:00 in 49C4.  At that time we will 
have sign-up sheets so that you can attend events that best fit in your 
schedule.  I will also follow up with an e-mail similar to this so that 
everyone is able to express their date/event preferences.  

Thanks so much for helping recruit at Cal Berkeley this Fall.  If you have 
any questions, please feel free to contact me at 3-3589.
