financial

> include flaws in market design that allow some market participants to abuse
> market power, limited availability and/or unequal access to transmission,
> temporary shortages of generation capacity. Some factors underlying high
> volatility of electricity prices may be of permanent nature and may be a
> necessary price to pay for increased market efficiency and expanded customer
