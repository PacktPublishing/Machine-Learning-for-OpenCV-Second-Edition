Just wanted to share the list of "one-page" bios and summary statements
that I have collected to this point.  I have two more yet to come and will
share them ASAP.  Have a great weekend and I look forward to seeing
everyone in "sunny/warm Waco" next week.

By the way, Bill Petty has challenged everyone to a 40 minute jog along the
river on Friday morning at 6:45 a.m. so bring your jogging gear.  I also
have heard from very reliable sources that Bennett Stewart is the odds on
favorite to "win the race" (Cynthia leaked the story that he's been in
training now for several months).

I'll also be sending you driving/parking, etc. instructions early next week.

Have a great weekend,

John
