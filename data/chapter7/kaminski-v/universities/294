Carlos,

I look forward to meeting you in person.

Dear Stinson,

I enjoyed our conversation this morning. I would love to meet with your
people to discuss collaborations that will be of mutual benefit to me
and the students and postdocs and your company. I am available on Mondays,
Wednesdays or Fridays, at just about any time (early mornings or afternoons
best). We'll probably need up to a couple of hours.

Please send me your address to mail you some info.

Best,

Carlos
