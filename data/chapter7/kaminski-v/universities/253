Vince and John,

I wanted to send you a quick note and once again say thank you for attending 
the Cal Berkeley presentation last week.  I am sorry for the low attendance 
on campus, however I did want to send some refreshing news.  I just received 
the resumes of students who would like to interview with Enron.  There were 
43 resumes submitted for the Technologist position and 46 resumes submitted 
for the Analyst position.  

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Ashley
