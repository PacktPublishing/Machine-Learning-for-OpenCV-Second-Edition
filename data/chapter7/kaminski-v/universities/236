Cindy,

Great to hear from you and I look forward to getting our interviews done.  I
am answering this from a hotel in Seattle so I don't have questions for you
at this time but can get them together for you.  I will contact Vince next
week and get a set of questions together for each of the three individuals
you mentioned.  I will have to talk to Vince about others who would be of
interest to interview.  I really appreciate your help in getting this
together and I'll work hard to get everything together for you next week.  I
don't have Vince's e-mail address with me here so I would appreciate your
forwarding this message on to him for me.

Thanks again,

John

Good morning Mr. Martin,

I would like to introduce myself.  I currently work with Christie Patrick
and Michael B Rosen in the Enron University Affairs department.

In recent discussions with Christie, she has suggested that I liaise with
you and our management in preparation for your and Vince Kaminski's case
study.  Christie has forwarded recent emails sent by you suggesting a few
convenient times that work with your schedule.  I will work with our
management and do my best to schedule one hour time slots for interviews
that fit with your outline.

Initially, I will schedule interviews with: Ken Lay - chairman and CEO,
Jeff Skilling - president and COO, and Andy Fastow - CFO.  If you feel that
you may need to speak with additional management, we will definitely try to
work something out the same day, so you don't have to travel back here.  I
will forward your project outline to the aforementioned participants once
the interviews are scheduled.  Do you anticipate drafting specific
questions?  If so, I would greatly appreciate a copy when convenient.

I greatly look forward to working with you and I hope that we can touch
base very soon.

Regards,


Cindy Derecskey
