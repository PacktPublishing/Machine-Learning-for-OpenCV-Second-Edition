Dear Mr. Kaminski,

I am writing to ask a favor for Dr. Michelle Foss. As you know we will
be running our "New Era" program from May 14- May 25th. Dr. Foss was
wondering if on May 22nd (between 1:30pm and 4:00pm) , we would be able to
bring
our participants for a tour of your trading floor. At this time we will have
30-40 people, and since only 10 people maximum should really be on a
trading floor we need to have 4 companies among which to divide our
participants. At this time, we have a floor from Coral Energy, and are
working with Duke,
and I will be contacting Mr. Paul Roberts to arrange for the Reliant Energy
trading floor. I was hoping very much that you would be able to direct
me to the right person to contact to arrange this tour. Will this be a
possiblity? I really appreciate your help very much. Thank you!

Best Regards,

Aisha Jamal
