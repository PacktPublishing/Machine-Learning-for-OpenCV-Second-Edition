Harvard Business School is doing a 5-year business case study on Enron. =20
Below  is the information that I have regarding their visit.   The name of=

the case study is Modern Giants (attached below)

(They are interested in developing a clearer picture of the architecture an=

design of Enron=01,s organization, products, and services--how the company =

its key businesses have been put together and how they work on a daily,=20
quarterly, and annual basis.)

1. An overview of the Modern Giants research project

2. Descriptions of three broad areas of research interest (business and
organizational design, new business creation, and capital investment
decision making) together with the associated interview questions.

We fully understand that these interview questions are far too
encompassing, and that there's no way we could get through all of them in a
single, one-hour meeting. What we plan to do is "specialize" the interviews
by the background and expertise of participants. In some cases, we will
focus only on new business creation; in others, we will focus primarily on
the allocation of capital; in others we will focus on the basic economic
model that underlies the trading or energy services business. Future visits
may focus on the remaining, unanswered questions, or on other areas of
interest of our faculty colleagues. These questions should therefore be
regarded more as a set of interests, rather than a strict protocol that we
will strive to complete from beginning to end.
Hope this provides the necessary background for the trip.
