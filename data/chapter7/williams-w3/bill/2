Hey there Bill!

I thought I'd drop a quick line just to do a quick introduction of myself.
Your buddy, Brendan, has offered your tour guide ability to me when I visit
Portland in July.  I do have a college friend out there (who I hope to
locate) so you might not have to be stuck with me. :)

Anyhow I'm Nikki.  I'd go more into depth but everytime I write it out it
sounds more like a personal add then an introduction!

Brendan tells me you are about to close on a condo.  Congratulations!  I
can't wait to have a place of my own!  Apartment life is horrible.  My
neighbor and I knock on the bathroom wall at each other in the mornings just
to say "hi".  I'm really serious.  I actually have really great neighbors in
my building and I have to admit, apartment life is a good way to get to know
people.

I don't know what Brendan has told you about me but here's the story.  I was
born and raised in New Mexico and hate it here!  I need trees and green!
Someone once compared landing in New Mexico to landing in a litter box.
Where there's not dirt there's piles of crap.  Now everytime a plane flies
me back home I look around and agree.

So, to say the least I'm a little stir crazy for a new environment.  The
first part of August I will be moving to Newport Beach, California.  Or one
of four other beach communities in that area.  I want to experience that
whole lifestyle for at least a year.  Then I'm moving to Oregon.  I've never
visited or anything I'm just drawn there.  To be perfectly honest it's
because of the two movies "Goonies" and "Kindergarten Cop".  I loved those
movies as a kid and have wanted to move to Astoria ever since.  Now's my
chance.  I just finished college and have a period of resting time before I
go after my master's in Public Health Administration or my MBA.  We'll see
which fits me best later.  I don't feel that at 24 I can really decide the
"best" avenue for the next 50 years of my career so I'm waiting for the life
experience to kick in and lead the way later.

As of yet I have no set plans as to dates, iteneraries, etc and so forth.
I'm a very spontaneous type of person I don't really "do" planning and
scheduling.  I just kind of show up and try to make my own fun.  It's better
that way.  Life can be too organized!

Well now that I've given you a "short" introduction...haha.  I'd love to
hear back from you about any conflicting dates that you might have in July.
Don't worry if they change I won't hold ya to them.  The only time that I am
forecasting for myself is the 12th through the 16th (of July) IF I don't go
to Calgary, Canada.  Currently I'm planning as many trips as I possibly can.
My youth is fading fast and I need to enjoy as much of it as I possible
while I don't have a husband and kids to take care of. :)

Hope to hear from you soon!
Nikki
