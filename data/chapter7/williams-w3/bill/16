Please forward this message to all members of your group and to anyone else who might benefit from this program.

Enpower IT has done an outstanding job in creating this application.  It is invaluable to me in verifying that all my deals are in Enpower correctly 
and the delivery point is balanced.  It should be very helpful to be sure that a desk, delivery point and/or region is balanced.  Please take a look 
and come by my desk for a demo if you would like.

PS - Thanks you Casey, JP, Gerald and Jason for helping me to test this application.

Rebecca

To Open:



To Run: 

1)  Enter the criteria into the filter at the top, paying close attention to whether you want Physical or Financial deals, and whether
you want to "Include Desk-to-desk" deals.  The more filter criteria you add the fast the extract will run.

2) Hit Extract




To Export:

The middle section of the application displays all the records or strips that were extracted.  This may be quickly saved to a text
file to analyze in Excel, by choosing File...Save... from the menu.


	
To Summarize and Subtotal:

The Subtotal area at the bottom of the screen, groups and subtotals the records based on the fields that are dragged 
into the gray area right below the filter (shown here in blue).  At the very bottom of the subtotal area is a GRAND TOTAL 
for all records extracted.
