Hey Guys. 

We have a new way to export from NP15 up to the Northwest. Cascade is a tie between CISO and PAC SYSTEM on the California Oregon border. There is currently 30MW Non-Firm Hourly transmission available on the tie.

The capacity constraint is on the PacifiCorp side of the tie,  and you can find the real number available on the PAC oasis site. Check under TRANSMISSION REQUESTS/ Offerings. The path name you need to check is W/PPW/CRAG-PACW//. Make sure you pick Hourly non-firm. 

On the CISO side the tie point is called CASCAD_1_CRAGVW by the CISO. 


Procedure:
Export at Cascade from the CISO. 
Buy PAC Transmission from CRAG to BPAT or whoever is picking it up from Pac System. 

Transmission costthrough PAC is only $5.84.

I know the NP15/MIDC spread is not as large as we have seen it in the past. It does on the other hand give us another option.

Geir
