After consulting with our California Scheduling team to determine why 5/12 volumes on our spreadsheet were not matching up with yours, I have revised my sheet, and I think you'll find this new one more fitting....

 		
Also, the 5/1 sheet has been revised slightly - namely, the NP-15 transmission column. Daniel, per our conversation this morning, the NP-15 and SP-15 on peak prices happened to be the same on this day, so they are correct as you see them in the sheet.

Please call me with questions.

Thanks,
Kate
