I've killed the Cal-Imbalance deal I entered under Short Term West BOM for 5/14 - 609174 - as well as the inter-desk swap between STCA and West BOM - 609240.

I double-checked Real Time Position Manager and the Forward Obligations report for this day, and all looks fine. I'll keep my fingers crossed that it remains that way until tomorrow morning. 

Please let me know if you have questions.
