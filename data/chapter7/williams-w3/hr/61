Grace -

Please schedule an interview for this candidate to meet with me, Bill and anyone else that Bill recommends.   We need to treat this one 'right' - he is the brother of a VP in Houston........

Thanks!
Amy

Bill/Amy:

Attached is Darrin Presto's resume. I have met Darrin in the past and based upon my first impression he would be a good candidate for real time. Please set up an interview.

Thanks
