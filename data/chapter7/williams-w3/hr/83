Hello again!

For those of you who are unavailable this afternoon, please send Amy a quick e-mail about your thoughts on Rusty (basically: YES or NO, with any feedback). All others are welcome to send Amy an e-mail as well; if you would prefer to meet with her in person, I will hold the 2pm reservation in Mt. Hood.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Grace
