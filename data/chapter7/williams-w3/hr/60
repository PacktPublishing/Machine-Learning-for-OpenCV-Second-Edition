You have been selected to interview Real Time Candidate Darrin Presto (brother of VP Kevin Presto). Darrin has indicated that he would be available to interview early next week. 

With that in mind, I would like to set up the interviews to take place on Tuesday, July 10th, beginning around 10:00am. Each interview would last about 45 minutes (max), so the last interview would finish around 1:45pm. If you are aware of any conflict with this day/time, please let me know as soon as possible. I would like to finalize this schedule today.

If you have any questions, please let me know!

Thanks,
Grace

Grace -

Please schedule an interview for this candidate to meet with me, Bill and anyone else that Bill recommends.   We need to treat this one 'right' - he is the brother of a VP in Houston........

Thanks!
Amy

Bill/Amy:

Attached is Darrin Presto's resume. I have met Darrin in the past and based upon my first impression he would be a good candidate for real time. Please set up an interview.

Thanks
