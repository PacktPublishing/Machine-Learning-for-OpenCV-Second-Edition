Bill: I've checked the information for the WSU Student Marketing meeting on 9/26, and it will take place at the WSU campus (so: no driving to Lacey, WA!). I have not yet heard back from the president of the organization, but will let you know the details when I find out what they are. The meeting begins at 7:00pm on the 26th--drive down that morning? I'll follow-up with you later.

-Grace

Hello!

You have been selected to represent Enron-Portland at an upcoming college career fair this fall or early winter. Below you will find the school and date of the career fair you are asked to attend. Could you check your schedule and let me know your availability? I'd like to know ASAP so that I can make arrangements for travel, etc.

Give me a call (or send me an e-mail) if you have any questions!

Thanks,
Grace
