Hello, and happy new year!

REGARDING NEW HEALTH INSURANCE CARDS FOR 2002:
If you signed up for a new health plan, your new insurance card should be arriving at your home address. 

Temporary cards for CIGNA, United Healthcare, Merck/Medco (the Enron prescription drug plan), and Metlife Dental are available at the Enron Benefits website**, http://benefits.enron.com. You will need your SSN and 4-digit PIN to access the system. (Once you are logged in, select Resources and Forms and scroll down to the desired plan.)

**PLEASE NOTE: You may also access this site for dependent care/health care and parking/mass transit spending account reimbursement forms.

If you have any questions, please let us know.

Thanks!
Your HR Team
