I have talked to Tim and he was going to get back with me.  I will see if we have made any progress.

Thanks!
Amy

Hi Bill - I just wanted to check in with you.  I realize I have to be patient as you don't have any positions open currently.  I'm now STARVING for the opportunity and ready to make some money.  I'd be delighted to come in for a second interview when you're ready.  Thanks.


Kind regards,
