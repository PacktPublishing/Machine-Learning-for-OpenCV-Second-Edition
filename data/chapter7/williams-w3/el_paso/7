Good morning Bill

On 4/28 could you move the -100 bookouts for HE 5 & 6 for $6.00 to the top
for direct bill.  Any cuts on the PSCO deals we are keeping together.

Also, today is the end of the month.  I will probably be checking out with
Amy (Kelley's replacement in Houston) Wed. or Thurs. so will need all the
models corrected by then.

Thanks,

Kathy
