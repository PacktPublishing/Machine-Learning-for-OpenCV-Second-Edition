Please refer to Enron Tag #23876.  The path is 

BHPLGS gen @ BHPLSYSTEM- BHPL (T) BHPL/STGL - BHPLGS - MEAN - LAPT(T)STEGW/DAVEJOHNSTON - MEAN - MIRANT- PPW(T)DAVEJOHNSTON/4C3- MIRANT- EPMI- APS(T)4C3/WW5 - EPMI- CRSPM1 - WALC(T)WW5/WW2- WALC(T)WW2/COOLADGE- CRSPM1 load @ COOLADGE.

We had problems getting the tag approved.  This is a good path and should flow.  Both the generating and load control areas have a copy of this tag and have agreed to implement this schedule real-time even if the tag is denied.  I spoke with Brandi at WACM (970) 461-7277 and Theresa at WALC (602) 352-2552.  

If there are any issues regarding how the load PSE should be represented on the tag, John Dake at WALC said the CRSPM1 was the appropriate PSE for these tags and there is no reason the schedule should be denied.   

You can reach me on my cell at 807-7861 if you have any additional questions.
