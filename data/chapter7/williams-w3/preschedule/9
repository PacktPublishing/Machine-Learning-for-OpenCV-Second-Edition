There is a 25 mw heavy load schedule that BPA is generating (contract# 23928) and SPP sinks at Humbolt.   The schedule is going real-time because SPP reported the transmission incorrectly to AVA transmission group.  We bought from BPA Deal # 486140.1 and sold to SPP Deal # 610573.1.  Please refer to SPP tag number #2848.  Be sure to call everyone in the path to check out.  

Thanks,
Stacy
