There is a 25 mw heavy load schedule that BPA is generating (contract# 23299) and PGE sinks at system.   The schedule is going real-time because BPA transmission group did not build the proper account for this path.  We bought from BPA Deal # 308337.1 and sold to EPME Deal # 489735.1.  Please refer to EPME tag number #10416.  I spoke with Matt at BPA Power side who agreed this was a good schedule.  Be sure to call everyone in the path to check out.   

Thanks,
Stacy
