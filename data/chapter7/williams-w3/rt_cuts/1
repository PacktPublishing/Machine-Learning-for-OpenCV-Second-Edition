Leaf,

Lisa Gang wanted me to tell the night shift that tag # 25883 is not a good tag.  We tried to cancel it but for some reason WALC denied our cancel request.  Cara already spoke to Leon @ PAC regarding this issue.  The reason this tag is not a good tag is the tranny request was duplicated in another tag (25825) which is a good tag.  If you have any questions please call Cara on her cell phone.
