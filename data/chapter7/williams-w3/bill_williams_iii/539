You know the drill, right?

We'll be short 50 mw (25 under STWBOM, 25 under STSW) for Friday and Saturday. On peak hours. Price is $64.60. Purchases from El Paso have been entered under both desks. Please reduce the STWBOM purchase price (704426) to $4 after purchasing energy in the market. (Adjust price accordingly if you buy from El Paso.) Sell back to El Paso at a zero price. Here are the deals:

704426 - STWBOM buys EPE
704432 - STWBOM sells STSW
704441 - STSW buys EPE

It appears this arrangement has been working quite well over the past few days (making money, not errors). Keep up the good work!
