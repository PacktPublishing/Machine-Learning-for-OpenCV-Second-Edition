Bill/Greg:

Harbor Cogen is finishing up installation of its 30 MW steam turbine.  This is in addition to their 80 MW gas turbine.  This turbine is going to be dispatchable by the ISO.  We will need to communicate dispatch instructions back to Harbor.  I still have a ways to go to fully understand how this is going to work with respect to payments, etc., but one thing we need to do is get set up so we can receive dispatch instructions from the ISO as we do for the ADS.  Apparently, the SRA is a little different than the ADS.  Can you call this guy and figure out what we need to do to receive SRA dispatch instructions from the ISO?

Thanks

C

Chris, see note below.  Last week we spoke and you were going to contact
Michael directly. Can you please follow through so he can give you any
required details that may be needed if you wish to use RMR client for
dispatching?  Thanks!
