Hi All!
For your convenience, this email is being sent as a quick update to the
progress of The Roosevelt.
We received Occupancy permits on the 8th floor from the City of Portland on
Friday June 29th.
Construction is almost done.....whew! We are sorry for the inconvenience and
look forward to all floors being completed.

Sincerely,
Kirstin Boettcher for Jeff Burghart P.C.
