Good Afternoon:

I have created PSW documents for all 4 of my regions for June 21, here are my findings today:

In PreSchedule Workspace:

What worked:
I was still able to successfully copy and paste large amounts of excel data into the PSW.
I was able to query build route successfully for each delivery point I needed.
I was able to change the color of text and fonts at will.
When running the Confirm function:
I was able to print the error log, which was helpful when I had to fix a few counterparty errors.
The routing speed was still very good.

What needs improvement:
The run time for the Confirm function is still far too slow to be useful in production. The rockies sheet alone took 2 hours to upload, the Mid C sheet took over two hours. I have not been able to populate the full data set because of this speed issue. I will continue uploading today, and try tomorrow to look at the full data set in confirm. I could not import the Palo Verde sheet in to confirm. I got this error message :ERROR:Access violation at address 004ED7E3 in module 'PreSchedWS.exe'. Read of address 00000000.
We need the ability to check for errors before running the sheet, I used another half hour fixing the errors and re-running the sheet.
A spot check of routing shows that the routes are still not showing the appropriate flag for physical vs non-physical. Everything shows non-physical.
Routing still did not happen on the Northwest Delivered deals that were moved in scheduling to multiple delivery points.

Question: Will the sheet support the capability of our transmission legs showing up where the E is now?  the weakness with having the path show from transmission 1, 2, etc, is it does not give the POR/POD or the firmness of the transmission.  
( The way a path should look is like this: SRP@PV-E-APS(T)PV/WW O#23305 F-WALC(T)WW/MEAD O#464521 MNF-EPMI-NEVP,  the way this same path would show if put in to the sheet as it is now will be :  SRP@PV-E-APS(23305)-WALC(464521)-NEVP.  This is incomplete information.)

OR, would it be possible to modify the sheet to accept the following information in the Trans and Oasis number cells? Instead of APS,  put APS(T)PV/WW and in the OASIS cell put 23305 F.


In Path Confirmation:

What worked:
I was able to choose and reset colors that help me read the information better.
The speed to pull up an individual path is MUCH BETTER.
I was able to select a group of paths in the line view and attempt to confirm them. The save takes too long, but it worked.


What still needs work:
I still cannot sort by Global ID or Tag number. Would a different tag logic work, instead of "PWX Tag 123"  show "123 (PWX TAG)?" Some marketers use letters for tags.
The cell with the path in the expanded view must auto-size to contain all of the path.
The program needs to insert a dash in the path when each cell boundary is passed.Upstream-Supply-E-Trans-Trans-Trans-Market-Downstream.Right now some run together. 
The path cut needs work, it is cumbersome, unclear on some entry requirements, and does not seem to recognize any number I put in it. This app seems like guess-work.

New path needs work as well.  
	The POR and POD needs to be a type and complete field( like in build route selection) not a first letter drop down list.
	The Counterparty list is just too confusing and cumbersome to be practical. It should mimic the deal entry list.
	The new record should be three tiered.  Supply first, then market,(both mandatory entry), then transmission as an optional third. To allow a Supply without a Market 	record is going to create many problems.
	How are these new records going to be routed?
	Also, our original intent was that the new path and path cut would drive deal entry, not deal entry being done and then numbers populated into Path Cut.




I will continue testing tomorrow, the hotspots I see now are the upload speed to Path confirmation, and a close look at how we need the Path Cut and New Path to work.


We are getting there, I am very encouraged!
