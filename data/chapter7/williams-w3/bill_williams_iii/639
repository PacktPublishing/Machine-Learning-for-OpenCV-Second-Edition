Mark -

Your current agreements has now expired (dated 6/21 and not signed until 7/9 - only good for 14 days).  In addition, you did not sign all the necessary places - each document requires 2 signatures (pg 6 and pg 7) - you only signed page 7 on both.

I have re-printed 2 executable copies and have left them in your mailbox.  Please sign both on pg 6 and 7 and return both to me ASAP.  I would like to have this finalized by the end of the week.

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thanks -
Amy
