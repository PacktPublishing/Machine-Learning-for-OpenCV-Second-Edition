Bill -

Come by and talk to me about an opportunity starting in october 1st.  Basically, Grays Harbor, Benton and Franklin would like to outsource some real time transactions to us for a short period of time until they get comfortable with SLICE.  They will probably come in for a meeting on September 20th or 21st in the morning to discuss this.  I would like you to be there for the meeting.
