Bill,

Marina and I took a sample of when we change Path 15 HA Con.  The sample covered Last Week in May and first
two weeks in April.  All the entries net added revenue to your book.

I know this is a little coy, but I suppose you don't care if it is in your favor.  If it is an expense, talk to you?

Apparently the trades are relieving Con on path 15.  That is probably you guys, right?

Let me know what you think.

Jim
