Bill,

These are currently being tested so all transactions will bridge into our downstream systems correctly.  I will let you know as soon as they are ready for use.

Leslie,

Bill Williams in Portland has requested hourly products on EnronOnline for the hours ending 12-20.  Attached is the proposed loadshape language.  Please let us know if these look OK.

Thanks,
