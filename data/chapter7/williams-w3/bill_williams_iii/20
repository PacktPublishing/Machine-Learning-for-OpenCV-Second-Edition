Market Participants

Due to the unusual events occurring on the East Coast, the CAISO is
anticipating the possibility of having some difficulty facilitating today's
Hour Ahead Markets and tomorrow's Day Ahead Market.

The CAISO is not suspending either Market at this time, however the
possibility for the suspension for one or more markets exists.

The CAISO will continue to facilitate the Hour Ahead Market as long as
balanced schedules are submitted.

A decision to suspend the Day Ahead Market for operating day 09-12-01 will
be made by 1200 PST today.

Please contact the CAISO Hour Ahead Operator (916-351-4409) upon receipt of
this message.
