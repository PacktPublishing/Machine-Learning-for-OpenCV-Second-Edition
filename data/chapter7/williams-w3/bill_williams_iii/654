Real time desk is short 5 mw HE 1-24 on Saturday 7/14 thru Monday 7/16 at Hot Springs to Cenex (a middle marketing customer in MPC control area.)  This power can be filled with the Frontier Energy if you chose and give them prevailing Mid C price .  If you fill it with the Frontier just use the account number for MPCO that is in the Frontier sheet when you call BPA.  If not pruchase this power at Hot Springs as I  have told Cenex we will be delivering it there.   In any event Real Time MUST CALL MPCO AND INFORM THEM AS SOON AS YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE FILLING THIS FROM.  I have already discussed this with Mike at MPC and they are aware that we are purchasing on behalf of Cenex but you still must call.  

We are short at the follwing prices:

7/14  Short 5MW at $55 HE 1-24
7/15 Short 5MW at $50 HE 1-24
7/16 Short 5MW at $60 HE 1-24

If you have any questions please feel free to call me on my cell.
