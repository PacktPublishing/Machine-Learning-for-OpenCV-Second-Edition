The technical difficulties with the SAP Security email box have been resolved.  You may once again follow the normal submission process as noted in the instructions for the SAP Security Request Form and the IBuyit eProcurement Request Form.  If you submitted a request for security during the week of  July 16-20 and have NOT received a notification of it's receipt, please resubmit the form.  We can not be certain that all mail directed to the box during this period was actually received. We apologize for any inconvenience that this may have caused you.
