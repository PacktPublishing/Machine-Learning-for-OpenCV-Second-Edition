FYI -

We had only one discrepancy between the El Paso model and the CARP report for July. Our checkout with Kathy and the Settlements group took approximately five minutes, as opposed to the five days we spent sorting it out last month. Thank you for your diligence and attention to detail in dealing with El Paso - you've made me very proud. Keep up the good work.

Thanks,
Kate
