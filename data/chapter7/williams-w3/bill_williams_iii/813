"California's power disaster has made 'energy' a front-burner issue for everyone. Through interviews with state and federal officials, power company executives, and average citizens, the documentary examines whether power companies and energy trading giants have capitalized on deregulation to make tremendous profits even as users suffer power shortages." (60 min.)
