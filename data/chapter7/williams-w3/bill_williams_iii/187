Tomorrow in the northwest.....

STNW has scheduled an extra 15 mw round-the-clock purchase from PGE at Montana System Border. We will not be flat in Real Time position manager because of this deal. You'll need to do 2 things to remedy this situation....

1. Sell off the length at Colstrip. If nobody's buying at Colstrip, you can buy a wheel from Colstrip to Hot Springs from Montana Power for $4.66/mw. FYI - the Dow Jones Mid-C price was $43 on peak, $36 off peak on 8/20 (latest numbers). 

2. Withdraw Tag #30458, which was entered to accomodate this extra schedule.

In other news, we are not doing El Paso or PGE lending for tomorrow, nor do we have a short position in California, so things should go smoothly in that respect. But then there's EOL......

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Kate
