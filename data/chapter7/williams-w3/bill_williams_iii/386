Two things -

1. Weather Tracking - Did we decide to ask Fundamentals about tracking forecasted-to-actual temperatures? Or would you me to organize this specifically for Real Time?

2. BPA Transmission Losses - Would you prefer that we pay back losses on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis? For billing purposes and general clarity, I think we should keep loss charges separate from actual transmission costs (i.e. pay them back in an annuity each day, week, or month as opposed to adding them into each reservation charge - too much room for error).

Also, Darin Presto and Casey Anderson should both have 100% access to the systems they need; but it seems to be an ongoing process, so we'll keep our fingers crossed.

Let me know what your thoughts are on these two things.

Thanks,
Kate
