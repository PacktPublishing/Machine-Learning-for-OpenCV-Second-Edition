One of the benefits of our suite at PGE Park is that we have the first right of refusal on non-Portland Family Entertainment events such as PSU Football games and the City JazzFest concert.  ENA will periodically receive notices of such events so as to determine our level of interest in purchasing the tickets before they are available to the general public.  Non-Portland Family Entertainment ticket purchase opportunities are for Enron employees, and the tickets may not be resold to outside parties.  

If you are interested in purchasing tickets for either the PSU Football games or City JazzFest, please notify me via e-mail by 2 pm Pacific Time, Friday, June 8.  These tickets are to be purchased by the employee. The entire suite must be purchased by Enron employees in order for us to obtain the tickets.  Twenty-two tickets per event are available:  18 are seats and stools, 4 are standing room.

?	The price for City JazzFest (Sunday, July 15) is $916 for 22 tickets = about $42 per ticket.  

?	The price for all 6 PSU Vikings games (22 tickets each) is $1,404:  about $11 per game, per person, and all 6 games must be purchased.

We will proceed with ticket purchase and distribution after you establish your commitment.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Best regards,

Anna

Description of City JazzFest:  This full day music fest will feature Jeff Lorber, Spyro Gyra, Marc Antoine and the headlining package, Dave Koz & Friends including Michael McDonald, Brian Culbertson and Norman Brown. The show is produced by House Of Blues Concerts.  An intimate concert setting has been developed at PGE Park that will feel like a small amphitheatre, but with all the new amenities PGE Park has to offer.
