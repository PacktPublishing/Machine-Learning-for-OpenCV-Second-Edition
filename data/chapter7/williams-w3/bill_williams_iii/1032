Ahoy.  Several words of wisdom: Switch your default outlook font to
"Verdana" and set it to bold.  This is clearly the most effective and
authoritative font.  I can see that you already use bold as default, which
is good, but you need to step up to the next level.

Here's my "vision" for this afternoon.  Let me know what you think.

1.  Hit SantaFe on 23rd for a little bit of 'rita (if I can hold myself back
from Jamaican red)
2.  Grab some dinner outside of shanghai or somewhere else in that hood
(outside seating mandatory)
3.  tbd- very difficult to forecast this far.

My brother will arrive at 6 or 7pm.
