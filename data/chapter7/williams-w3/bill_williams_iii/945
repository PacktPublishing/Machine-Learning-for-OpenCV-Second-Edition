Good Afternoon Ron,

We just had a meeting with Bill Williams, head of real-time trading in Portland, to discuss some problems we are having with the real-time deals flowing to the Deal Confirmation system.  Currently, the deal confirmation system is pulling the term information so that changes made by real-time to reflect actual volumetric flow & price are not seen by the confirmation groups.  One possible solution has already been examined and that would be to have the real-time traders use deal entry to make all the changes.  This solution will NOT work.  If the real-time guys start changing the deals in deal entry, the original negotiated deal will be lost.  Also, and more importantly, the time to make all the changes for the real-time adjustments in Deal Entry would make it impossible to keep up with the high volume of deals we are now seeing.

Thanks,  David Poston
IT Manager, Portland
