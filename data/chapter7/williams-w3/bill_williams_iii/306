On August 8, the ISO distributed a notice that, in further compliance with
the June 19, 2001 FERC order, on Thursday, August 9, 2001, the ISO was
implementing a new version of the ISO's real time Dispatch software to
revise the process by which proxy bids are calculated.  Please note that the
software changes described in that notice were actually implemented
effective August 10, 2001, HE 1600, for the real-time imbalance energy
market.
