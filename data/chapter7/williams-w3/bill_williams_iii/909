Sierra Pacific Holding:		We don't know their unit ID because we're not their SC
22mw available during off-peak hours, 25mw prescheduled (balance-of-the-month deal), total output equals 47mw, for $55 or greater.
Must confirm the trade of the APX trade application, and the APX is their SC.

Thanks,
Stan
