I've already done the usual.  As I told you before, we don't have the tapes here.  You make the decision if you want to order them for the $40 spread.  Still working on the other deals you asked about.  The answers are out of my realm, so I have an appointment with Risk to find out what's happening and why we're seeing things 'calc'd' at the apparent correct price when they are in EnPower at an incorrect price.

We could pull tapes?  Ask the person who did the deal?  There is nothing in notebooks.  Any word on the BOM PMA?

Bill-

  Can you think of any other means to find out if this deal that we have in the system is good?

Dear Settlements Coordinators,

  I'd like to ask a favor...
  Could you guys please check your counterparties to see if anyone has a dispute on 3-14-01 regarding a purchase or sale of 40 MW at HE 3? 
    

   Sincere thanks,

  Virginia
