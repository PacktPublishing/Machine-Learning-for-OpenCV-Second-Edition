Just wanted to make sure you all aren't getting accused of this.

I mainly think it is a Control Area to Control Area issue, as we are always bound by Tags and Oasis numbers

Cara-

  Thanks for the forward!  Did the West Desk (especially Real Time) get this?
  Thus far, we have not been accused or charged, as far as I know.

Subject: Rate for Unauthorized Use of the Transmission System


Dear Customers-

Effective June 15, 2001, the Rocky Mountain Region (RMR) implemented Rate Schedule L-US1, for Unauthorized Use of the Transmission System and Ancillary Services (copy of rate schedule attached).  This rate schedule was posted to RMR's OASIS website under 'Current Business Practices' on August 4, 2001.

During the month of July 2001, RMR began actively researching after-the-fact usage of RMR-managed transmission and identified some unauthorized use of transmission.  Some of you have been sent letters concerning perceived unauthorized usage in July.  you should receive those letters shortly.

RMR has discovered different causes of unauthorized use occurring within WACM and have attached a list outlining some of those causes.  This list is by no means a complete listing, but rather just what's been seen to date. 
A
 s RMR did not post this information publicly until August 4, 2001, we do not feel that we can charge customers for the instances discovered in July, but please be advised that from August 4th forward, this charge will apply.

Please do not hesitate to call me or Paul Humberson at (970) 461-7327 if you have questions or would like to discuss.
