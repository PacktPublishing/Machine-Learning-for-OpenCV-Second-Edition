Stephanie -
I believe I've found these trades. The first one already had Bloomberg in as the broker along with the appropriate flat fee. The second deal did not have a broker or fee in it - those have been added. Please let me know if you still don't see the trades.

639921 (Geir Solberg) - Sell AEP/25 MW/SP-15/$105 - Deal flows hours 14 through 18, and broker fee reflects $15 flat times 4 trades - $60

640346 (David Porter) - Sell TransAlta/50 MW/SP-15/$105 - Deal flows for HE 16, and broker fee reflects $15

Thanks,
Kate
