Bill,

  This email and the next email I am forwarding to you are in regards to follow-up on the PMA deal # 549162.1 that was zero'd out at HE 3 because neither side of the deal shows it.  It definitely looks like a service deal because of the price.  So I have asked Sandy at MPC to check once more.  I have also emailed all Houston Settlements Coordinators to check for counterparty disputes on that day so we can see if this purchase and sale belong to anyone else. 

  Virginia

Dear Sandy,

    I hate to ask this, but could you please check MPC's numbers for March 14, 2001 for an EPMI purchase from MPC of 40 MW's at HE 3 for $134.  We still seem to have this in dispute.


  Thank you,

  Virginia
