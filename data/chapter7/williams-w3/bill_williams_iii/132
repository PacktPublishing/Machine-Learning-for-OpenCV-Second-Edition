Can you make sure that everyone in Real Time knows that if the ISO calls to remove a Waiver for a generator, the Services Desk needs to be notified.  Last evening, apparently the ISO called and removed a waiver for Harbor with Craig and we were not notified.  It is not his fault as we have not communicated the importance of this, but from now on, we need to be notified.  This is because we will need to put in supplementals or at least be aware that we could be dispatched at any time once the waiver is pulled.  It also gives us a heads up that the ISO needs energy.

Thanks!
