Don't forget to mark your calendars for our company picnic at 
Mt. Tabor on Saturday, September 22, at Noon.  
Bring your family!

A Hawaiian band and live hula dancers will provide the entertainment.  Games are to be played and prizes are to be won. Noho's Hawaiian Cafe will be catering the event.

Remember to wear your "aloha" gear - there will be a prize for best dressed!
