We return to lending for Thursday:

STWBOM and STSW are each 25 mw short on peak at PV. This power was sold day-ahead at a price of $40.50. It will need to be procured in the hour-ahead market - 25 mw on peak at PV under each book. Then the power needs to be sold back to El Paso at $0 - 25 mw on peak at PV under each book. Deals are -

744503 - STWBOM buys EPE
	 On Peak/PV
	 25 mw @ $40.50

744505 - STSW buys EPE
	 On Peak/PV
	 25 mw @ $40.50

As always, let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Kate
