Group,

Per my earlier email, there has been one change.  Harbor's second unit (HRBGN_7_PL2X3), 17mw, will be down for maintenance on July 4th.  I have submitted an outage report to the ISO.

So, no action is required for this unit on 7/4.  The gas turbine, HRBGN_7_UNITS, 80mw, is still available.

Thanks,
Stan
