Bill,
	Chip has said this will be done by end of business on Monday.  I will give you a status update mid day Monday as to our progress.  We came to see you but you were not at your desk.  Chip will grab you if he sees you.

Dave

Dave,
Sorry it has taken so long to get back to you.
First, regarding handsets.  Each real-time desk needs 2 handsets.  Kate Symes needs another handset under her desk as well.
Also, I need to have my extension displayed on Kate Symes turret, and on each RT turret as well.  Also on Stewart Rosman's, Greg Wolf's, Les Rawson's and Chris Foster's.  I also need Kate Symes extension displayed on my turret (this is an immediate concern beyond the handsets). Her TRID is #106 ext. 3939, my TRID is #140 ext. 3730.
I will address our treatment of handsets with the group.
Feel free to grab me this afternoon before 4PM for a meeting if you still have time.
Thanks for the help.
Bill
