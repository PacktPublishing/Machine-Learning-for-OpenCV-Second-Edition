It's at the Breakroom on Capitol Hill.  Ahhh yes, Racheal, I showed up with
a couple of friends and she wasn't there.  At about 7:30 Nancy came up to me
with one of the "Bretts" and said that Racheal got caught up in a Job for
Costco....whatever...

Erica is in town for her sisters wedding.  She might come to the Brad show
if she can make it.
