Bill, on Saturday night I handled a cut on a schedule that we bought from calpine @ Mead and sold to Valley.  We were informed of the cut after the hour was over and the subsequent hours were resupplied by Calpine.  Natalie at Calpine agreed to be charged LD's for the 1/2 hour that the power did not flow and we agreed to an integrated number of 13MW that did flow however, I told her we would get back to them Monday for the exact charges.  I did this due to the fact that we sold this power to one of our service customers and I felt we may want to discuss with them first before charging the LD's on this transaction.   Please advise on how to proceed on cuts like this.  Our sale to VEA was at $153 and our buy from Calpine @ $107.  I have entered cut notes with specifics in Lotus notes.  I will be in on Tuesday however, it might be best to resolve this issue Monday.  Thank you for your attention to this matter.
