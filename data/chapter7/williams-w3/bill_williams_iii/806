Bill -

Can we get Cara, and/or the entire SW prescheduling team, access to the West Real Time database in Lotus Notes? They need to be kept abreast of El Paso dispatch information, which appears to be most readily accessed through the dispatch e-mails in Lotus Notes.

Please let me know what I can do to facilitate this.

Thanks,
Kate
