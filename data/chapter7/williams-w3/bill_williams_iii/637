If you have any questions or would like confirmation on performance ratings for employees at the Senior Specialist or below level, please see me. 

All reviews need to be completed and turned in to me no later than August 17th.  Yesterday, you should have received an e-mail with the performance review template for each of your employees.  

Analyst ratings have not been finalized as of yet - there is a final meeting in Houston on 7/18.  I will let you know once these ratings have been approved.

Thanks!
Amy
