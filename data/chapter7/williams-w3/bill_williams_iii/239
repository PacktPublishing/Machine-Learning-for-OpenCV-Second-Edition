Bill,

     Sorry we missed the 1 large that your desk had coming for congestion revenue on Saterday (8/11/01).  To fix the situation I have made a manual entry for that date but since the flash has already been set and saved you will not see that change until the month end reports.  You will just have to trust that the correction was made, and look for it at month end.  I will check also when we run the month end to ensure you see the revenue.   We won't miss anymore congestion revenue.   Let me know if you have any questions.

Darren

Guys,

We are missing the congestion revenue from HE 7 on Saturday morning (10 mws at $99.00) in the flash we received yesterday.  Remember, the awarded congestion wheel caused the 10 mw variance we discussed on Monday.

Please see me with questions.
Thanks,
Bill
