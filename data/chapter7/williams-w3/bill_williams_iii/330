Elliot,
I have attached the standard PEP review form. The last three categories regarding goal setting and objectives to be acheived still need to be completed.  Feel free to add in any comments you might have in other sections as well. I will plan on meeting with Jesse and you early next week.  If you have any questions just let me know.

Thanks,
Bill
