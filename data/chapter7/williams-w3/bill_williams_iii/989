There are a few changes to Saturday's schedule, so please disregard my previous email.
------------------------------------------------------

Group,

The plan has slightly changed for submitting supplemental bids for our generators for Saturday, 6/9.  The plan is as follows:

Only submit supplemental bids for the generators if a Stage 1 emergency is called.  This is due to the ISO's ability to ramp the units up and down every 10 minutes.  We don't want to give them the ability to do this if there is not a Stage 1, 2, or 3 emergency.

So, please try to sell the generators excess available output as an SC to SC trade.  Below is their preschedule, mw's available, minimum price threshold, and unit ID's.  Also, attached is a sheet with all the contact names and phone #'s.  Please save it and reference it when dealing with the generators.  

Harbor:		HARBGN_7_UNITS
Supps:		No action required, they are down for maintenance on Saturday.
SC Trade:	No action required, they are down for maintenance on Saturday.

Delano:	PANDOL_6_UNITS
Supps:		15mw available, 30mw prescheduled, total output equals 45, HE1-24, Saturday, for $40.

Wheelabrator Martel:	MARTEL_2_AMFOR

SC Trade:	3mw available, 7mw prescheduled, total output equals 10, NP15, Friday and Saturday, above $50.

Sierra Pacific Holding:		We don't know their unit ID because we're not their SC
Supps:		No Supps, we are not their SC.  The APX is their SC.
SC Trade:	15mw available, NP15, Friday and Saturday, above $60.

If you have any questions don't hesitate to contact either Chris Foster or myself.

Thanks,
Stan
