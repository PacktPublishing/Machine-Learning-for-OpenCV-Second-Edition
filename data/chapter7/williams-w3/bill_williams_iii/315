 GENERATION AVAILABILITY DATA SYSTEM (GADS) TRAINING

In preparation for the implementation of the ISO Generation Maintenance
Program, California ISO has arranged with the Manager of NERC GADS to
conduct two training sessions on their Generation Availability Data System
reporting software and database.  Each session will take two days to
complete.  This training is free to representatives of Generation Asset
Owners.  Participants will be responsible for their own travel and living
expenses.  We have tentatively arranged for two sessions, one in the
Northern California Area, and one in Southern California, depending on the
number of seats requested.  The proposed dates are shown below.

This course is designed to familiarize those personnel who will be
responsible for reporting NERC GADS data for the Generating Asset Owner with
the software tools, data structure, and data rules.  It also provides
instruction on how to use the GADS database for running various performance
and statistical reports on your specific units or industry information.  A
detailed agenda is attached.

The exact location for the training will be firmed up at a later date.

California ISO needs to know the numbers of people the Generating Asset
Owners propose to send, in order to complete the planning.  To that end, we
are asking interested parties to respond by August 21, 2001, with the
following information:

Generating Asset Owner	Requested Seats in North	Requested Seats in
South

Response should be by e-mail to Dan Poole, dpoole@caiso.com
