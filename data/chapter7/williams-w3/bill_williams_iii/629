Group,

Delano is going down for a maintenance outage beginning HE23 this evening, Tuesday, 7/17.  They will be down through sometime Monday morning.  They are only going to be able to produce 20mw, and they are prescheduled at 30mw for Tuesday and Wednesday.  Please purchase 10mw, HE23-24 on Tuesday, 7/17, and 10mw HE1-24 on Wednesday, 7/18 to keep them whole.  They are in SP15, and their unit ID is PANDOL_6_UNIT.

Thanks,
Stan
