Geir and Todd -

We'll be paying back line losses to APS tomorrow morning. Following are the deal numbers and terms.

729302 - STWH buys EPE
	 HE 1-6: 2 mw
	 HE 7: 1 mw
	 4C345 @ $25

729307 - STWH sells APS
	 Same hours and volumes
	 4C345 @ $0
	 
Tag is #29706.

I made the purchase from Steve at EPE, and Lori is our contact at APS. Both are aware of the payback schedule and El Paso expects to see it represented in our real time model. 

Please call me with questions.

Thanks,
Kate
