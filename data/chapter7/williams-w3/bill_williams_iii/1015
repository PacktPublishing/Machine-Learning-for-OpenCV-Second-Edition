Similar to the meetings that I held last month with each of you, I would like to meet with a random group of employees to get feedback on how things are going.

I have identified the following individuals.

Kourtney Nelson
Maria Van Houten
Bert Meyers
Diane Cutsforth
Mike Purcell
Kate Symes
Kysa Alport
Jesse Bryson
Holden Salisbury
Kathy Sheppard

Is it OK for me to meet with the above employees individually for about 30 minutes sometime over the next few weeks?  Would you prefer or recommend someone different than those individuals mentioned above?

Thanks for your time!
Amy
