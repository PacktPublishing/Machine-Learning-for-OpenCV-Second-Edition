Good Morning Guys,

We have a new IT developer moving to Portland from Houston.  Susan Amador, one of our original FSP developers, will be starting in Portland on September 1st.  She has very strong technical skills, great communication skills, and an excellent knowledge of the entire FSP system.  I think she will really flourish in our Portland environment.

Thanks,  David Poston

Rationale for leaving Houston
1.  More user interaction.
2.  Expand technology toolkit.  (Wants to also work on our local Portland applications (CALWEB, SQL server, etc)
3.  Likes the NW
