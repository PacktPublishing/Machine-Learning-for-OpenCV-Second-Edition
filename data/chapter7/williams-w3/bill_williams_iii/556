Group,

Just wanted to let you know that beginning Thursday, 7/26, we have a new services customer on board.  They are called Nove Investments, they are a 2mw landfill generator in NP15.  They will be prescheduled day-ahead for the most part, so there won't be much real-time action required (unless they suffer a unit outage).  All their information (such as unit ID, preschedule, and contact person) will be on their services sheet in the Services Book.

Thanks,
Stan
