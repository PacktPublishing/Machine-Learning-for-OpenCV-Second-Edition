Darren was looking at an "old" report.  We re-ran the report and it balanced, which makes sense.

Thanks for your patience while Darren runs up the steep learning curve.

Jim and Darren,

We relieved Path 15 congestion for HE 7 on Saturday morning.  We flowed 10 mws from Malin to FC345. This resulted in the 10 mw "variance" in the report. I have added deals to Enpower to flatten the report, these deals are only necessary for the sake of the report. The identical variance in the north and south indicates a wheel or load shift. I prefer to not enter these extra deals. Please see me with questions if you do not understand why the report variance exists.

Thanks,
Bill
