Thanks a lot Cara. I've asked Virginia for Settlements contacts on hourly deals, and I think the best documentation I can provide Tatiana will be the spreadsheets that Settlements uses to checkout with counterparties at the end of the month (provided they've all got those for Q1-01). 

I'll consult Tim and Stacey on this. Thanks again for your help.

Kate

Arthur Anderson is an outside consulting firm hired by Enron to keep us on the 'straight and narrow' they audit many of our risk functions and other information as double check that what we say is happening is really happening.

I have been told by people higher up in risk to NEVER question Arthur Anderson.  BUT,  I would encourage you to E-mail Tim Belden or Stacey White and ask them these same questions.  You need to be as comfortable as possible.

Cara -
When you get a moment, could you tell me what this Power Audit is for? Does Arthur Andersen work for us? That was my impression, but Bill asked and it occurred to me that I might want to know exactly who Tatiana is and why she wants this information before I start handing it out.

Let me know what you know.

Thanks,
kate

Tatiana,

I have looked up all 5 of these deals in the system, and need to refer you to the following people for follow up
Deal # 507713.1
Deal # 528572.1
      Deal # 566541.1

These deals are all West Hourly deals, and can be researched by Kate Symes, our real time coordinator.

Deal # 514141.2
      Deal # 536771.2

These need to be handled by someone onthe East desk,  514141 is a Long Term New England book deal, the other is an East Desk real time deal.  

I am sorry I cannot be of direct help on these, I have data for West Desk deals, but only Term and Cash. Please feel free to call if you have any questions.

Cara Semperger
503/464-3814

Cara,

We are in the process of auditing Power Trading for ENA and were referred
to you by Corry Bentley in regards of support for the West deals that we
selected for testing. Due to the fact that there are no executed contracts
for these deals, to complete our testing we need to receive 3rd party
support (NERC Tag or 3rd party invoice) for the following West deals:

Deal # 507713.1
Deal # 528572.1
Deal # 566541.1
Deal # 514141.2
Deal # 536771.2

We are in the final stage or our audit, so your quick response would be
greatly appreciated.

Please call me at (713) 646-6335 if you have any questions.

Thank you.

Tatiana
