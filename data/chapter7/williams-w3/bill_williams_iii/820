Hey there ogre!!  :) Just teasing!!!


Well unfortunately I'm still up in the air over the Portland thing.  It
doesn't make it any easier when I know that not only does one of my best
friends reside there but now I have a new lil' buddy!  I am so excited about
seeing Portland and meeting you.  You are just as Brendan described!  I just
can't imagine that that big deep voice comes out of such a baby face!

Bill you know just how to push all the right buttons to get me to really
want to go!  The second paragraph of your last E-mail made me so jealous!
That was probably the most romantic setting and scene and to think that it
was written by a man!!!  I am sooo impressed!  You might not even know what
I'm talking about!  Typical male!  hahaha.  Just in case... "the roof
scene".  What's even better is that you weren't trying to be suave!

I think that your little "city portrayal" has just entered into the
..."things about Oregon I know I'm going to love".  Now we'll see if Sarah
has an open roof top!  You did miss a couple of important features though.
If I may... Uh hmmm... The scene lacks a certain social depth.  It requires
a beautiful girl/guy, a light blanket, soft music and if I drank wine (which
I don't) a bottle of Boones Farm Strawberry Hill 1993.  Ok the last part is
a joke I just don't know any other brands of wine. :)  A nice bottled water
with lemon for me I suppose.  Reverse Osmosis and filtration only.  :)

I'm sending a couple of pic's of me from my Tahoe snowboarding trip last
December.  They are actually the only ones I have in jpg format.  I think
the only differences are that I have a little curlier hair now and it's a
bit longer.  But basically I'm the same.

Tell ya what... if I do get to go I will get a hotel room not because I
don't trust you etc. but because it's just the "right" thing to do.  Then
I'll give you a call or stalk your condo building looking for the resident
on the 8th floor?? Answering to Bill Williams III and that hangs out on
rooftops.  Oh and the clencher??? It's located across the street from the
Paramount Hotel.  Scary how I listen and pay attention to detail isn't it?
You know I'm joking.... Right?  If I were like that I'd jump at the chance
to stay with you.

I really hope that I get to make it tomorrow.  If not I know I'll get to see
you last of August.  I'm counting on it!  Oh and you will stay with me at
the town house.  I insist.  It's a little different when a girl stays with a
guy then when a guy stays with a girl.  It just "looks" better the other way
around!  But like I said you WILL stay with me in August.  I'm 10 minutes to
the beach and maybe by then I'll have my California tan!  Mmmm!  Can't beat
that!

Ok well I'm going to bed.  I'll call you to let you know what the plans are.
My plane leaves at 9:19 am so I may not get the chance to E-mail you before
hand but we'll see.

Good night!

Nik
