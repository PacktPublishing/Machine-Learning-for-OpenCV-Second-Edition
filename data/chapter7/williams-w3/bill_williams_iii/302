After the Day ahead market ran, the COI branch group TTC in the (N-S)
direction was changed from 4300 MW to 4020 MW and in the (S-N) direction was
changed from 3675 MW to 2450 MW for HE's 1900 through 2400; and the PDCI
branch group TTC in the (N-S) direction was changed from 2875 MW to 1956 MW
and in the (S-N) direction was changed from 2084 MW to 1904 MW for HE's 2100
through 2200 for operating day 8/13/01.  The reason(s) for the change is,
for the COI, line work; and for the PDCI, the Celilo Valve Group #1 was
forced out of service.  This applies to real time only.  The ISO will update
you of any changes in line rating status.  Sent by Market Operations,
inquiries please call the Hour Ahead Desk.

The system conditions described in this communication are dynamic and
