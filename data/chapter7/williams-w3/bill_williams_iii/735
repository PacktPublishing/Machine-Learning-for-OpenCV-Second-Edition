Bill-

  MPC looked again and does not show this deal.  Most of the Houston Coordinators have responded and they have no discrepancies (purchase or sale) on March 14th.  There are 2 who I'm awaiting responses from still.  
  
  I'll let you know if I find either side.  Right now, I'm inclined to think the INC sheet is wrong and there was no deal at that hour.  Can you or Kate check with the trader who 'booked' the deal at HE 3 and let him search his notes and explain why the MW volumes and prices changed that HE in the INC sheet when there is no further documentation.....


  Thanks,

  Virginia

Virginia,

I took a look at the log sheet from the dispatchers and there was zippo in
the line!
If your records show 40 MWs at HE3 at $134 we will just go with your
numbers.
Let me know!

Hope you had a great 4th.  I got a couple days off so it was wonderful!!!

sandy
