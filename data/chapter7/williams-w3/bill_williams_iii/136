Bill - I'm in Copenhagen awaiting a plane and am in
the SAS lounge.
Took a shower and changed for the next flight.
Sweating like a bastard.

Saw the Timbers won last night.  Great.  Should make
the playoffs playing that good soccer.

I have no phone (AT&T did not deliver).  And no
computer.
If you need to mail me - send it to:
wjwjr99@yahoo.com

I'll check here before I fly out again.

Don't burn out on your birthday until I get home.
