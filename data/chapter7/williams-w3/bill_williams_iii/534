After the Day ahead market ran, the PDCI (TNOB) branch group in the (S-N)
direction was changed from 2084 MW to 1904 MW and the ISO Share (PNOB) was
changed from 1407 MW to 1285 MW for HE's 1700  through 2400 for operating
day 7/26/01.  The reason for the change is for the Northwest Generation
Urgent pump repairs.  The first applicable Hour Ahead market to run with
these values is HE 1700.  The ISO will update you of any changes in line
rating status.  Sent by Market Operations, inquiries please call the Hour
Ahead Desk.

The system conditions described in this communication are dynamic and
subject to change.  While the ISO has attempted to reflect the most current,
accurate information available in preparing this notice, system conditions
may change suddenly with little or no notice.
