We are a go for our  first test ......

We are purchasing 6 MW of Spinning capacity from LADWP for HE7-HE22 August 6 2001.  They will deliver any energy called on to the ISO at LA4 (Victorville Lugo).  We purchased the capacity for $ 15/MWH and if the energy is called we pay $78.26. LA understands and is willing to follow ISO instructions passed through our real-time desk with regards to ramping up and down within an hour.

Phil please submit our energy curve to the ISO at the cap for every hour. 

Bill lets talk on Tuesday to discuss if our energy was called and if so how it went. 

 Thanks 

NFB
