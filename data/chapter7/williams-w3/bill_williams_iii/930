Real Time Plan for 6/15

Harbor:		HARBGN_7_UNITS and HARBGN_7_PL2X3
Nothing has been pre-scheduled.  If prices get above $100 they can be turned on.  They can make up to 100 MW (85 and 15).  

Wheelabrator Martel:	MARTEL_2_AMFOR
6mw available, 7mw prescheduled, total output equals 13mw, HE1-24, NP15, for $50 or greater.

Wheelabrator Shasta:	WSENGY_1_UNIT4
2mw available, 0mw prescheduled, total output equals 2mw, HE1-24, NP15, for $70 or greater.

Sierra Pacific Holding:		We don't know their unit ID because we're not their SC
20mw available, 25mw prescheduled, total output equals 45mw, HE1-24, NP15, for $55 or greater.
Must confirm the trade of the APX trade application, and the APX is their SC. 

If you have any questions don't hesitate to contact either Chris Foster or myself.

Thanks,


Chris
