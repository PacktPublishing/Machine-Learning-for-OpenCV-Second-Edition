Gentlemen,

Tom Halter from Gas Recovery System will be calling over the weekend.  They will be coming back from an outage over the weekend.  They have 8mw available in SP15.  Just give him your bid, and if he accepts it, you will confirm the transaction over the APX trade application.  Just click on the "Bilateral" button in the APX, and then all you have to do is highlight the bilateral trade at the bottom, right click, and then click "confirm bilateral."

Thanks,
Stan
