After the Day ahead market ran, the COI branch group TTC in the (N-S)
direction was changed from 4100 MW to 4000 MW; and Path 15 in the (S-N)
direction was reduced by 500 MW each hour, and in the (N-S) direction was
changed from 1275 MW to 1100 MW; and Path 26 in the (N-S) direction was
changed from 3000 MW to 2500 MW for HE's 1100 through 2100 for operating day
7/30/01.  The reason for the change is they are forced out for emergency
maintenance.  The first applicable Hour Ahead market to run with these
values is HE 1500.  The ISO will update you of any changes in line rating
status.  Sent by Market Operations, inquiries please call the Hour Ahead
Desk.

The system conditions described in this communication are dynamic and
subject to change.  While the ISO has attempted to reflect the most current,
accurate information available in preparing this notice, system conditions
may change suddenly with little or no notice.
