To whom it may concern:

It's come to my attention that the SRP OASIS user ID which was being used by Enron's West Hourly trading team has been disabled. Holden Salisbury, one of our cash traders, spoke with someone in your office about setting up a new ID for the Real Time group. Enron Power Marketing, Inc. already has company-wide access to the site; but the Real Time group regularly reserves transmission on this OASIS site and needs a login name and password of its own.

Could you please let me know what information I need to provide to get this set up? I would greatly appreciate your help in issuing a new Real Time password as soon as possible, or in directing me to a more appropriate contact.

Thank you,
Kate Symes
