Heather,

  According to our conversation on how to account for the 7 MW's missing on 6-4-01 from deal # 615780.1, I have done the following:

  I found deal # 664324.1 that was entered by Bill Williams to account for these extra 7 MW's.  However, this deal was entered as a purchase annuity from LT_NW to MPC.  I didn't find any other deals for Real Time to pay back LT_NW.

  SO I extended LT_NW deal # 615780.1 in EnPower Scheduling so that MPC could be kept whole, then I took Bill's annuity deal # 664324.1, changed it to a purchase annuity from the ST_WHOURLY book to the LT_NW and changed the price from $7150.92 to $7014.92 to compensate ST_NW for the energy not sold by Real Time. 

  I hope this info will help you in calculating the DPR of these 2 deals, especially with a counterparty change.

  Please see me with any questions.

  Virginia
