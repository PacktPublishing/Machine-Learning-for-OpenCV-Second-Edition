If you want to send this, go ahead. Like I said, I just sent her something to this effect. Come to think of it, this might unnecessarily anger her and the rest of the Confirms posse. I'll get to it this afternoon.

How about this?
 
Evelyn,
Please try to send or copy any emails to me at Williams III, Bill. NOT Williams, Bill. This email went to Bill Williams with Enron who happen to be in Sweden...
 
Kate Symes will be taking care of your spreadsheet when she has an opportunity. As you may be aware we have recently brought out EnronOnLine to the hourly market. We have seen a dramatic increase in volumes, and priorities have shifted as a result. Daily deadlines must be met. We are working on our deal entry accuracy. I appreciate your patience, we will attend to this issue shortly.

Please find attached an excel spreadsheet of Bloomberg deals I can't seem to match up with our deals in Enpower.  This is for August 1 through August 22.   None of these deals have Bloomberg as the Broker in Enpower.  I was told in June to allow a two day grace period before the deals should be in Enpower and that did not occur.

Please let me know if there is anything I can do to help resolve these problems.
