Group,

Due to the recent drop in day-ahead prices, we have a few counterparties who scheduled less than their P-max generation.  Therefore, we need to submit supplemental bids so they will be covered in case the ISO calls on their generation (for the difference between the P-max and their prescheduled generation).

Additionally, if you can make an SC to SC trade with this generation please do.  If you are able to do an SC trade, please make sure it's for at least a 4 hour run.  Make sure you're in contact with the control rooms to let them know what you're doing.  And if you do make an SC to SC trade, don't forget to take out the supplemental bids for those hours.

So, please submit supplemental bids, or sell as an SC to SC trade for Harbor, Delano, Wheelabrator Martel, and Sierra Pacific Industries.

Harbor:
Supps:		80mw, HE1-24, Friday and Saturday, for $140.
SC Trade:	80mw, SP15, Friday and Saturday, above $125.

Delano:
Supps:		15mw, HE1-24, Friday and Saturday, for $40.
SC Trade:	15mw, SP15, Friday and Saturday, above $40.

Wheelabrator Martel:
Supps:		6mw, HE1-24, Friday and Saturday, for $60.
SC Trade:	6mw, NP15, Friday and Saturday, above $50.

Sierra Pacific Industries:
Supps:		No Supps, we are not their SC.  The APX is their SC.
SC Trade:	30mw, NP15, Friday and Saturday, above $60.


If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask either Chris Foster or myself.

Thanks,
Stan
