	I've entered two deals to pay APS back for line losses incurred on 7/12 and 7/14. We'll pay these back on Wednesday, July 18. The 	details are as follows:

Deal 689392 - Buy from EPE
	         HE 1-5: 2 mwh
	         HE 6: 1 mwh
	         HE 15: 1 mwh

Deal 689396 - Sell to APS
	         Same hours & volume

	To the El Paso trader for these hours (Craig/Steve/Geir/Eric), please enter a price into the buy from El Paso (689392) after making the 	trade. Please let me know if you have questions.

Thanks,
Kate
