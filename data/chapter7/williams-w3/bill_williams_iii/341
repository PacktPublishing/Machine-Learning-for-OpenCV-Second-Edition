I will be 40 years old this Saturday, and was thinking about having some friends around for pinochle and soda crackers.....No, just kidding. I'll actually be turning a different age which I'll disclose to you if you come to my party and partake in some fine draft beer and fajitas and HOT CHICKS!

Festivities begin around 7 p.m. Bring something to grill - we'll provide the fixings for fajitas. Directions are as follows......

I-84 East to 33rd Ave. exit
Left off the exit
Straight through the light at Broadway & 33rd
Left on Brazee (directly across the street from Grant Park)
	
	My house is directly ahead on the corner of 32nd Place and Brazee. Tall, white with green trim. Guarded by two mean cats.
	Call if you get lost - 503-288-6546.

See you on Saturday!
Kate
