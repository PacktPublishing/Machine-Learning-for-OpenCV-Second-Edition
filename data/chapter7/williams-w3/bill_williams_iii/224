Hi Bill:

I work with Neil Bresnan in Houston and I'm responsible for entering the real-time deals into the database. I was hoping that whoever creates the real-time sheet that you send to us could just put in the delivery point instead of including both points in a spread deal. I think it would be easier for anyone entering the deals here to just have the delivery point. Hope I have made my request clear, please let me know if I need to clarify this further. 

Thanks a lot,

Geiv
