After careful consideration and discussions with the dispatchers, I decided to leave Copper on for Friday night 8/18.  There were several reasons for this decision including the PV outage,  the fact that, Newman 1 was only released for 32 megawatts, and the fact that when we needed Copper last night during the PV outage they had problems bringing it up.  I felt that from a reliability standpoint it was probably the right thing to due given those factors.  If either of you have any questions or concerns regarding this matter please feel free to contact me.  Thanks --GUZ
