Group,

This evening, Friday, 6/1, you will need to call the ISO real-time desk to have them change Harbor Cogen's Pmax.  This morning, we had them change it from 80mw to 85mw through HE22.  We did this because we made a sale through HE22 with the assumption that their Pmax was 85mw, when in fact, the ISO had it at 80mw.

So, please call the ISO real-time desk this evening to have them change Harbor's Pmax from 85mw back to 80mw.

Thanks,
Stan
