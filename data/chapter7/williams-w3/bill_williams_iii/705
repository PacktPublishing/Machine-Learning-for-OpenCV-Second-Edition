I would like to thank everyone that contributed to the Beach Bowl 2001 for ALS.  My grandmother passed away from this debilitating disease in 1986 and since then there has been only one small breakthrough in the treatment.  Hopefully with your donations and those of others we can make a difference for those suffering from ALS. It means a great deal to me that you were able to help out even though the event was so far away from Portland. Thank you again for your support and I miss everyone.
