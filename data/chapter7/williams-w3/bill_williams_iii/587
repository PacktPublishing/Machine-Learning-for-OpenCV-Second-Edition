The first sentence bothers me. I've never lent anything from anyone in my life. Are all of the traders familiar with "lending agreements"? Is this enough explanation to avoid confusion on Monday?

Group,

We are lending from El Paso Electric on Monday. We have sold 15 mws for HE 7-22 to ST-SW at $62.50.  We are paying El Paso $4 for the service to lend from their system.   The sell to ST-SW is under the ST-WBOM book (#696314), the purchase from EPE is also under the WBOM book (deal #696315-note the price will be changed to $4 on Monday from $56).  Please buy energy to cover this 15 mw short on Monday under the ST-WBOM book and sell to EPE at $0 under the ST-WBOM book.  The deal is physically prescheduled going out from EPE.  We need to schedule the 15 mw going to EPE.  Please do NOT buy from EPE in the morning even though they may be fat.  We are hoping to do more lending with EPE going forward and therefore need to make this as easy as possible for their dispatchers (do not bring up lending to them-it will lead to unnecessary confusion).  If you have any questions concerning this procedure please call me. 503-887-3449 (c) or 503-274-0502 (h).

Thanks,
Bill
