Following are the details of Tuesday's lending agreement with El Paso - 50 mw on peak at Palo Verde:

709300 - STWBOM buys EPE
	 HLH/PV
	 25 mw @ $55

709310 - STWBOM sells STSW
	 HLH/PV
	 25 mw @ $55

709314 - STSW buys EPE
	 25 mw @ $55

These deals have been entered day-ahead, as well as a STSW sale of 50 mw somewhere in the market. Then, in the hour-ahead market, we'll need to procure this energy elsewhere and enter deals under the appropriate desk. We'll reduce the El Paso purchases (709300/709314) to $4 and sell back to El Paso at $0, creating a $4 delta which constitutes the lending fee. Please let Bill, Holden, or me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Kate
