When you trade with Bloomberg, PLEASE NOTE BLOOMBERG AS THE BROKER IN DEAL ENTRY. Also, please include a $15 FLAT BROKER FEE per trade ($.60 per mw for 25 mw pieces; $.30 per mw for 50 mw pieces; $.20 per mw for 75 mw pieces). Confirms is reporting about 50 "missing" trades from the Real Time group in July. The process of "finding" these deals takes much longer than simply entering the broker in the deal at the time of entry. 

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments about this procedure. 

Thanks,
Kate
