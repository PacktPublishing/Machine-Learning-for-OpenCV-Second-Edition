Building maintenance somehow got a hold of Debra and she knows about the hole in the wall.
I told her I had no idea how it happened.   I just wanted you to know.
I basically told her I found the hole and I called on my own.  The maintenance people have her number on file 
or something, so she was looking around for the original person that called.  

Sorry.  Thought I could keep it a secret.  You can't keep anything from her it seems.
