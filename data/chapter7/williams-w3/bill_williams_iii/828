Following are the errors I came across while uploading Real Time inc sheets for this year:

Feb Trading: Run-time error '-2147217904 (80040e10)':
	         Procedure 'AUDIT_SP_Delete_INC_MASTER_For_Date' expects parameter '@DEAL_DATE', which
	         was not supplied.

Mar Services: Run-time error '13':
	          Type mismatch.

Jun Trading: Error number 3001: Arguments are of the wrong type, are out of acceptable range, or are in conflict 	         with one another...

Jun Services: Error number 3001: Arguments are of the wrong type, are out of acceptable range, or are in conflict 	          with one another...

Please let me know how we can address these problems.

Thanks,
