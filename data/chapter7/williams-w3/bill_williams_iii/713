Greetings Bill,

Yesterday I mentioned that I would like to take some unused vacation before I move to Cara's group.  I was hoping to get off August 10-19, and was hoping to be scheduled for the day shift on Aug. 9 (so I can catch an evening flight).  Please let me know if this is OK with you. I'm copying Slinger.

Thanks,

David.
