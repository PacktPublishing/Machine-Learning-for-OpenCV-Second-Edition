We have checked out with our counterparties according to our numbers, but MPC claims they have done their control area checkouts and they stick by their numbers.  There is a grey line here because the MW's that we are missing on those 5 days are actually 'in favor' of the counterparty who we sold to, so it may be that they had a discrepancy, but did not pipe up.
None-the-less, if I 'adjust our system accordingly' (meaning, put the trades in or increase the # of MW's), we'll have to hear from those counterparties.  I'm planning on telling them that the control area checkouts have been done and that they need to check their control area numbers.  I think Sandy at MPC will be willing to support us if our sale counterparties want proof.

Let me know if you have any other thoughts.

Thanks to Kate for all her help.

What do you mean adjust our system according to MPC's numbers until you do? 

Are we correct? If the answer is yes. Tell MPC we are correct, we have checked out with our counterparties (thereby verifying our incredible correctness), but..because we love them so much...we will...this time only...take it in the proverbial shorts.  Next time...it will of course...be there turn...
Good luck and thanks for your help.

Bill-

  As we have been back and forth for 5 months now, there has to be a decision made on the Montana Imbalance piece for March 2001.
  Kate and I have done everything to find information to support ours or MPC's numbers and we have knocked out most of the issues, however, there are 6 discrepancies that we do not agree on and both we and MPC are standing on our numbers. I have filled out tape requests for these 6.  Please keep in mind, though, that we do not have access to these tapes(and have not had since April). These requests will go to Tim.

  Five disputes are for MW or to add a deal.  These will be deals that we will not be negatively affected by as we will pass them thru to another counterparty.  The only problem I can forsee is that the other counterparty will dispute the 'pass thru', especially since we have already checked out with them.
  Only one dispute (a pricing issue) could potentially leave us with a negative $1500 DPR.

  I need you to make the call today.  Kate has the tape requests in her posession as well as all of the backup information from the research that we have done.

  If I don't hear from you by tomorrow morning, I'll adjust our system according to MPC's numbers until I do.

  Thanks,

  Virginia
