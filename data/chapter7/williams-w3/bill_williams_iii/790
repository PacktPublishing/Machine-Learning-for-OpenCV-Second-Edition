Ad Hoc'ers:

One last time before we shoot it over to Mark and ISAS.  Thanks for the
comments, good catches.
 <<tag time table draft_rev3.doc>>

As far as comment #1 (LCA vs. PPT vs. PST), this gets into the white paper
idea discussed last Wednesday.  Lisa was going to tackle this (she's
given-up sleeping to fit it in) and I'd asked her to distinguish between
referencing time in a product definition versus time in a process
description.  But I believe she is on vacation fighting forest fires.

This table is used in a process (submission and assessment of E-Tags) and is
some-what independent of the time zone(s) that the product or commodity is
referenced by.  Guess I'm letting my preference slip in here - since we are
dealing with a daily process, the timing table should use a prevailing time
reference (e.g., LCA or PPT, etc.) and not a "fixed" time zone (e.g., PST,
CST, etc.).

Enough of me, let's talk about your comments to the latest table.  If there
are none, it'll go to Mark at COB Tuesday July 3rd.
