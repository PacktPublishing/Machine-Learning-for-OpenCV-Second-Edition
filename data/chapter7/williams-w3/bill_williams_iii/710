We'll be paying APS for line losses 7/11 at HE 7. I've entered two deals to cover this - a buy from El Paso (Deal #679653) and a sale to Arizona (Deal #679693). 

PLEASE ENTER A PRICE INTO THE BUY FROM EL PASO - 679653 - AND NOTE THAT PRICE IN THE EL PASO MODEL. LAST TIME WE PAID BACK LINE LOSSES THIS DID NOT HAPPEN. 

Let me know if you have questions.

Thanks,
Kate
