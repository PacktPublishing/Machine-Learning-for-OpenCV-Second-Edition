Group,

Just wanted to let you know we have a new generator coming on line, Desert Power.  They have 2 units totaling 65mw, located in Utah, and they are in Pacificorp's service territory.  Please remember they are in Mountain Time, so please be careful when speaking with them (try to always speak in "hour ending _ Mountain Time).  

They are running this afternoon, Wednesday, 8/15, for the first time.  For the first week or so they will be "working the kinks out" in the real-time market.  The easiest thing to do would be to either sell them directly to Pacificorp, or to buy a wheel from PACE to Four Corners345 (or another point of delivery via Pacificorp's oasis web-site).  The contract language is set up to where we get 1$/MWh for dispatching the unit, plus an incentive to sell them above a certain percentage of the Dow Jones PV day-ahead index.  So, during the testing phase, please just take 1$/MWh when you're selling the unit output.

If you have any questions, Mike Etringer was the guy who put this deal together, Les is also familiar with the deal, as am I (to a smaller extent).

Thanks for your help,
Stan
