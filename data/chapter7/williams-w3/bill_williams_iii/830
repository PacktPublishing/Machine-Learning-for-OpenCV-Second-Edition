I'm working with IT to get an EES mailing list set up so we can send the Real Time sheets to them each night with only the click of a button. In the meantime, they'll need you to click just a few more and send the sheet to.....

EES Power Settlements
Ainsley Gaddis
Neil Bresnan
Jubran Whalan
Judy Dyer
Michael Spruiell

This is only temporary. Don't worry.

Thanks,
Kate
