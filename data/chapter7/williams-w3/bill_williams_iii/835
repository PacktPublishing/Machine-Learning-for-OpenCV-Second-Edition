Ahoy young Williams.  Where do you want to play golf on Friday?   I think
something in North or East Portland would be cool.  We definitely need to
get a pony keg for the bbq Friday afternoon.  The note I sent at work is
copied below.  Only a couple people have responded.
Later.

Subject:	Timbers game this Friday

To all,
The Portland Timbers are playing this Friday evening.  Admission is ~$5 and
the game starts at 7pm.  These games are a blast and it would be fun if we
could get a group together.  There will be a pre-party at my house from
5:30-7:00.  Please let me know if you would like to go.

Also, Please forward this message to anyone else in your team that would be
interested.
Directions to my house and PGE park are attached.

Directions to my house (we will be in the backyard):
