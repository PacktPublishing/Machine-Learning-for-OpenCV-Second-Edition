Cara - Bill (III) and I know of an individual that is looking for a career change. He is currently available - has a degree in engineering and Masters in Business.  I can expect he would be interested in the position - sort of like Bill originally - does not have trading experience, but is a fast learner and would be a good addition I believe to the team.

I do not know the salary range for this position - but would expect it to be near entry level.  This may be a bit of a nip to John (Adams) - but as both Bill and I have been talking to him about for a year or so now - Enron is a great place to work, training is top shelf - we have good people, and need more good people to keep our edge.  Who knows what his career could go to in a few years. John has extensive background in pulp and paper, and could end up in that trading floor someday.

John is a Graduate of the Naval Academy - former A-6 pilot, a great golfer, and all the rest, and more importantly - has a very good work ethic.

Let me know what you think
Regards

Bill W (the Elder)

Cara - I want to attend this session but am stuck on a conference call.
 I have 1-2 people I know that would be interested and I am trying to understand more on scope and of course pay level.

If I can't get in at 11 - can I get with you?
