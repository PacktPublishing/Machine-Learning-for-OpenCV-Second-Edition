Intel:
Saturday through Tuesday HE1-24 we are sending 4mw to puget system for a services deal to Intel.  This deal has started 9/01/01.  They will preschedule it on Tuesday to start Wednesday.  Until then we are filling it real time.  You need to get 4mw to puget system HE1-24 Saturday through Tuesday.  You need to call puget dispatch(not RT) and let them know where it's coming from:(425)882-4630.  And you need to tag it each and every hour***.  If you have any problems you need to call Chris Foster immediatly(any hour).  This is a big deal and we need it to go smoothly while real time has it for the first four days.  Any questions call Chris.  It goes in the ink sheet as a sale to intel at $34.60.  There is a sale enpowered through Tuesday: #759607(link your purchase and transmission to this deal).

***On the tag in the comment section puget dispatch wants to see MPC(If montana is generating)/BPA/PSE/INTEL.  They are saving the tags as a record of the deal and this helps them differentiate the tag from other real time deals.  

I filled this HE 1-4 with Frontier which came up last night.  Frontier tripped at 3:05 I got the call at 3:30 and it was a real headache to get the contingency reserves put in for HE4 and a new purchase for HE5.  If you fill this with Frontier you're asking for trouble.  Use the montana if you can.

If you fill it with Montana we have a BPA transmission account from Hot Springs to Puget #844794
