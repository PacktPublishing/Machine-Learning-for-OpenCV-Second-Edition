Mark & Todd -

Looks like one of you was logged in as Mark Guzman on Friday, June 22, and entered a deal for STCali under  the STWHourly book. This threw us out of balance with the Cali desk in Forward Obligations and made Risk very concerned for a period of time Monday morning. 

This is a reminder that deals done under the STCali book on the purchase side need to also be entered under STCali on the sale side. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Kate
