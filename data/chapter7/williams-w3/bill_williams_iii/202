In the Southwest, EPE lending continues. STWBOM and STSW are each 25 mw short on peak at PV. Day-ahead price is $46. Enter deals to fill these shorts in the appropriate book. Reduce purchase prices in the following deals to $4. Sell back to EPE at $0.
Deals are:

	740196 - STWBOM buys EPE
	740230 - STSW buys EPE

In the Northwest, we've got a lending agreement going with PGE. STWBOM and STNW are each 25 mw short off peak at Mid-C. Day-ahead price is $27.25. We have not entered a placeholder purchase in the day-ahead market, so Real Time position manager will be 50 mw short off peak at Mid-C. Make purchases to fill this short. Under the appropriate desk, of course.

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding these agreements.

Thanks,
Kate
