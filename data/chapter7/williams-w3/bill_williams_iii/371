Group,

Wheelabrator Shasta (WSENGY_1_UNIT4) sold 2mw, on-peak, for Wednesday, 8/8.  They actually won't be able to produce (unit problems), so we need to buy power real-time to cover their day-ahead sale.  So, please purchase 2mw, HE7-22, NP15.  They sold day-ahead at $65, so if you can buy-back for below $65 that would be great.

Thanks,
Stan
