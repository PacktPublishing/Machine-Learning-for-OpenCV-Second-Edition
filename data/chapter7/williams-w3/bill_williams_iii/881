Just a quick note to acknowledge the great job that Geir Solberg did in helping our office out during Tropical storm Allison.
Our phone lines, computers and cell phones were down.    Additionally,   we were short staffed due to floodwaters downtown.

One of our service customers,  Teco,  wanted to sell some test power in South Texas.   Geir was contacted via satellite phone.
He sold 230 megawatts each hour to AEP.   He used the proper terminology unique to Ercot and sold the energy at a decent price.
He maintained good,  detailed notes and was able to relay this information to me the following Monday.    
Most importantly,  this was a seamless transaction to the customer.

Again,  thanks for the help.
