Bill I sent this to the wrong Bill Williams.  I am forwarding this email for your information.  I have received a response from Kate indicating she will get to them however she is extremely busy.  

If there is anything I can do to help resolve these issues please let me know.

Kysa/Kate

I have compiled a spreadsheet with the Bloomberg hourly deals I still haven't received a deal number for from July.  Please see the attached.  The 1st column are the Enron deals #'s I THINK Bloomberg should be added to.  If those are correct please change accordingly and add fee.  If not please research.

Thanks
Evelyn
