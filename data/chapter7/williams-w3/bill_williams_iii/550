I can benchpress 70 lbs now. Cool, eh? oh yeah baby. So no luck with the soccer gig? I'm sure you'll get faster it'll just take some time. I'm still running slower than I should be which sucks, but hey you just gotta keep going. I've definitely made noticable progress which helps keep me motivated, but it's still kinda annoying-but in a good motivational way. 

on another note, did you see that special sauce band when they played?

Sweet work on the weights.  You're lucky you can see the X games.  I am at a horrible angle and cannot see a damn thing.  I have been playing soccer again with limited success.  I have to be the slowest bastard on the field.  It's really frustrating, I am hoping my knees get healed so that I can finally play like I used to.  I have NO idea about a party at 2 in the afternoon.  I am thinking it is like a Tupperware party and that alcohol will not be provided...But...

I'm just sittin back here (WAY BACK HERE) trying to watch the X games on the TV up front. My workout was very very good.  I've been running and/or weigh training at lunch for the past month. I feel so much better when I workout. It's helped me deal with my work issues. Anyhow, yes I did get invited to that candlelight party thing. First of all, I don't even know who Erin Hall is. Secondly, I have no idea what a candlelight party is, but it sounds lame. 2 in the afternoon? Candlelight? What is that all about? So, I'll talk to ya later gator.
