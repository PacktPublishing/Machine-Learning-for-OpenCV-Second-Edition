After the Day ahead market ran, the COI branch group TTC in the North to
South direction was changed from 4150 MW to 4100 MW for HE20 from 4300 MW to
4100 MWs HE21 and HE22; in the South to North direction from 2721 MW to 2572
MW HE20 from 2721 MW to 2572 HE21 and HE22 for the operating day 09-12-01.
The reason(s) for the change is extended 500kV line work. The first
applicable Hour Ahead market to run with these values is HE20. The ISO will
update you of any changes in line rating status.  Sent by Market Operations,
inquiries please call the Hour Ahead Desk.
