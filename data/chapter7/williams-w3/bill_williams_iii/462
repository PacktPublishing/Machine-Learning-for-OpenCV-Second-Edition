Todd Bland is a summer intern from Texas A&M that is working in the real time group this summer. He is scheduled to return to school in mid-late August. I have recommended that he spend 1/2 a day with various groups (orig, structuring, fundamental, settlements, and asset services) prior to his departure. He has arranged to be available August 8, 9, and 10th. Anna Mehrer will be contacting each of you to arrange a date and contact person for Todd to spend a few hours with. If this does not work for you or your group please advise Anna and she will schedule accordingly .

Thanks
