I regret to inform you that Glenn Surowiec has decided to leave Enron to pursue other career opportunities.  Glenn has been a welcome addition to the West Power Structuring Desk and his presence and contribution will be missed.  Please join me in wishing Glenn the best of luck in his future career.
