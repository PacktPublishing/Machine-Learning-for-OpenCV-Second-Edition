ACCOMPLISHMENTS:

Since joining the Enron Real Time Group in January, I feel that I have become a valuable, knowledgeable member of the Team.  I consistently show a willingness to learn and take on new responsibilities, whether it be training new members of the group or developing new ideas.  

I have learned all the major responsibilities in a short period of time which include cut management, balancing reports, and taking responsible and favorable risk to reward opportunities.

I participate in all extracurricular activities such as onsite training to further my knowledge of the power trading business.

I have demonstrated the ability to keep a two-way market on both the bloomberg and the APX Trading Platforms.

I have learned all the major and some minor transmission points and have demonstrated my ability to wheel power around the WSCC grid.

I feel my leadership abilities have helped the newer members of the group learn their duties by following my example in every day tasks.

I have built a good rapport with most of the cash and term trading members, and support staff.  This includes taking time to understand how my job affects others.

I know all the functions of Enpower.

I know to schedule transmission on all the Oasis websites.

I know how to tag on a real time basis and am ready for the implementation of no-tag, no-flow.

I know how to schedule power on CAPS and CISO WORKSPACE.

GOALS:

Become more effective at trading power and eventually earn a trading position with Cash or Term.

Have a zero tolerance for errors in my daily work which includes note taking, empower, and cut management.

Become manager of Real Time Group in 6 mos. to 1 year.

Learn more about the fundamentals web site (ie.reading transmission constraints, weather reports, etc.)

Join the Analyst pool.
