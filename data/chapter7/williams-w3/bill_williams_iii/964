I agree with Jerry's proposal.  However, I would like to add one more
thing...
Change the "PSE Submit Deadline" for a real-time tag to 20 minutes (instead
of 30 min).  We are insinuating that already, when we say the "Provider
Assessment Time" is less-than or equal to 10 minutes and the "Time to Start
of Transaction" is greater than or equal to 20 minutes.
Anyone wishing to discuss this further, call Mons at 602-618-9798.



Thanks!
Mons Ellingson

Subject: FW: Possible new E-tag time table


Jerry Dempsey has sent the attached regarding the preschedule flag in E-Tag.

What he is proposing is:
*	a revision to the timeline tables in A3A to enable software to make
the determination of whether or not a tag is for preschedule or real-time
(currently it is a flag set by the PSE creating the tag).
*	Referencing time in terms of the Load Control Area's prevailing time
(this fits the Authority Service is associated with the load control area
and it's the Authority Service that keeps the time).

It may be possible to get this revision worked in to the 1.7 release.

Process
Please review his proposal and comment.
Specifically, do you support the concept of removing the flag and using the
timing table logic?
Do you support adjusting times to reference the Load Control Area prevailing
time?

If we reach a consensus on this issue by the end of the week, we can forward
on a recommendation to Mark for distribution to the whole ISAS.  If there is
support from all of ISAS, then it can be taken to NERC IS/TISWG for
approval.

Please let me know by the end of business June 15, 2001.
