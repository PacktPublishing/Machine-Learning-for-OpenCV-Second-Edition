   Dear Bill, 

               This is just a quick note to say "Thanks" for your visit
& interest in the Audi. I'll keep my eyes open for a used Black A4! In
the meantime don't hesitate to email or call me with any questions. As
soon as the 2002 A4 arrive I'll touch base as well...503-601-3060

                                My Best, Craig
