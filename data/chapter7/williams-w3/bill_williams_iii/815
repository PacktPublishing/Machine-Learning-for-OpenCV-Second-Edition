Good Afternoon,

I am pleased to announce that we have finally completed the 10 day parallel test milestone for FSP.  We were also seeing solid performance for our key metrics during the parallel (template writing 1:30 - 2:30, finals processing 5-7 minutes).  Lastly, based on my understanding of our go-live bet, my total debt owed to Tim Belden = $13.00.  Tim, I gave the money to Debra.

What Next?

User Training
I will be working with the DA & Real time guys to make sure everyone is up-to-speed with the new system.  We are also in the process of developing some user documentation cheat sheets to help in the transition.

Production Parallel
We have already begun using FSP in parallel in production by writing templates in FSP & comparing them to CAPS.  We will continue doing this until we are getting consistent results between the two systems.  This production parallel has necessitated some changes to the existing Enpower_to_CAPS report that we have already started modifying.

How long? 

Once bit, twice shy.  No money on this one, but I don't think it should take over a week to train the users.  The production parallel may take a little longer.  I am really relying on the users to wrap this one up.  Kysa Alport has already volunteered for this duty and I spent a good part of today training her.  

Thanks,  David Poston
