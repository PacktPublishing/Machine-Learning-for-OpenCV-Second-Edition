All,
	Tonight we are having the large 'TV' removed from the SE Corner of the floor and the one in the SW corner moved out of the walkway space.  

The removal of the large screen is due to how low it hangs and the hazard it presents to people walking in the area.  Since we do not use that screen, and we do not have a good place to put it, we will store it until a suitable use is identified. 

The smaller screen will be move North and East about 3 feet to get it out of the walkway.

Regards,

Dave
