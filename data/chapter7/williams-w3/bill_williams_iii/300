After the Day ahead market ran, the COI branch group TTC in the (N-S)
direction was changed from 4020 MW to 4300 MW and in the (S-N) direction was
changed from 2450 MW to 3675 MW for HE's 2100 through 2400 for operating day
8/13/01.  The reason(s) for the change is the line work is finished.  This
applies to real time only.  The ISO will update you of any changes in line
rating status.  Sent by Market Operations, inquiries please call the Hour
Ahead Desk.

The system conditions described in this communication are dynamic and
subject to change.  While the ISO has attempted to reflect the most current,
accurate information available in preparing this notice, system conditions
may change suddenly with little or no notice.
