Chris and Heather,

  I wanted to let you all know that I have added some replacement deals to the ST CA and ST W Hourly books that we spoke about yesterday.  Below is an explanation of why, and I have listed the old deals and the replacement deals......	

ST W Services sold a position to the ST CA book and ST ST W Hrly desks, but the energy didn't flow due to a scheduled outage.  Since the energy didn't flow, the desks entered some sales to WHEELABRATOR to sell back the energy that didn't flow.  This sale should have been to the ST W Services book to sell back the position, not to WHEELABRATOR.  I zero'd out the sales to WHEELABRATOR and entered intra-desk annuities.  Please see below:
