Bill,
I called down to parking to find out about your parking security card.  He said I would have to bring the card down myself if the reader isn't working.  He also wanted to know what time you came in this morning, he said that might have something to do with it.  hmmm...  Well, if it doesn't work Wednesday morning please let me know so I can take the card down and have it checked out.
