As we have moved into the shoulder months of September and October we need to be aware that the El Paso load curve is shifting.  This means you will slowly start seeing a greater morning ramp than in the past few months.  We need to keep this in mind and utilize the dispatch and load curves supplied to us by El Paso to ensure a smooth morning ramp.  For the past two days the night shift has oversold for HE 6 to the point of having to turn on the steamers both days.  There is no reason that we shold be selling HE 6 and turning on the steamers at the same time.   Be very careful NOT TO OVERSELL FOR HE 6.  If you have any questions about load curves feel free to talk with Bill or a senior member of the group.  Cheers---GUZ
