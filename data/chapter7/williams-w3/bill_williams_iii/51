Subject:	prior month adjustments for WHOULY book

Bill and Kate:

Attached please find the prior month adjustment items we got from Settlements for WHOURLY book.  The total P&L impact is 
-$82,555.76.  Please note that this is still preliminary and please review and verify them (* I will do the same).  I am sending them to you just to give you a heads up.

In some of the items Settlements didn't put the deal number under explanation.  I have sent out an email to them so we can know what those adjustments are for.  At this time of the month Settlements are usually overwhelmed by questions and requests so they might not get back to us before Risk needs to finalize the dpr on next Tuesday morning for 8/31.  If you feel uncomfortable taking any one of the items in your 8/31's P&L due to unclear explanation or other reasons, please let me know.

Subject:	prior month adjustments for WBOM book

Bill and Kate:

Attached please find the prior month adjusment items we just got from Settlements for WBOM book.  The total impact is -$198.13.  I have verified them and believe they are all valid.  Please take a look and let me know if you have any questions.  If you don't disagree, you shall expect to see those amounts recognized in your final P&L for 8/31/01 next Tuesday morning.

 << File: STWBOM PMA 083101.xls >>   

At this moment I am looking at the items we got for WHOURLY book.  I will let you know at the latest sometime Friday (8/31) afternoon when I pulled them together.

Thanks,
Fran
