Tatiana -

After researching these three deals, we've found that our group does not have access to reliable third-party documentation to support their occurrence. Because there are no Real Time confirmation letters, and no NERC Tags were done for hourly deals at the beginning of this year, it falls to cash invoices to support the validity of Real Time deals. I've spoken with Stacey White, in Houston's Risk group, and she explained to me that there are documents our Settlements group can access that may provide the information you need.

I'm sorry to keep sending you from group to group, but I'll be more than happy to help you get ahold of people who can provide you with relevant deal documentation.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Kate,

I was referred to you by Cara Semperger in regards to obtaining support for
the following West Hourly Deals:

Deal # 507713.1
Deal # 528572.1
Deal # 566541.1

To complete our testing process we need to see 3rd party support (such as
NERC Tag support or 3rd party invoice) for the deals mentioned above. Since
we are in the final stage of our audit, your prompt attention to this
matter would be greatly appreciated.

Please call me directly at (713) 646-6335 if you have any questions.

Thank you!

Tatiana
