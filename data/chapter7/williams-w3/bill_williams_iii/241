For Friday & Saturday -

We'll be short 50 mw on peak at PV - 25 under STWBOM and 25 under STSW - as usual. Please make purchases to cover this short and reduce the purchase prices in the following deals to our $4 service fee. Make sales back to El Paso @ $0 to complete the buy-resale.

735292 - STWBOM buys EPE
	 On peak/PV
	 25 mw @ $48

735308 - STWBOM buys EPE
	 On Peak/PV
	 25 mw @ $48

STWBOM is also short 50 mw on peak, SP15, at a day-ahead price of $45.15. Please let me know if you have questions about how to proceed with either of these short positions.

Thanks,
Kate
