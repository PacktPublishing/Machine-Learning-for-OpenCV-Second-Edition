Bill -

I believe I gave you resumes on the following individuals.....can you please provide me with the feedback?

Tracy Brason
Bill Burns
Alex Gabriychuk

If we already spoke, I apologize....still trying to get used to our new tracking system (also, can you remind me your decision?).

Thanks!
Amy
