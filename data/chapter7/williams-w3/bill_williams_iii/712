David, 

I was following up on your e-mail, and found that none of our PV schedules got imported into Lotus Notes for 7/10.  I am investigating today to see why, and populating the schedules into lotus now.  Thanks for the head's up.

Hey Cara,

I was discussing how there are holes in the system.  Tonight WESCO called regarding tags 26681 and 15502.  Neither is in lotus note, but both are in OATI.  I thought you might want to investigate.

Cheers,

David.
