As you should now be aware the preschedulers were unable to get all of their tags in by the tagging deadline on Friday.  Cara has left a color coded sheet of delayed tags that the real time group must implement between 4 hours  and 1 hour prior to the power flowing.  Please take a look at this sheet when coming in on shift.  Also, there are two tags that need special attention tomorrow (7/2) evening.  Tag numbers 25843 and 25870 have been printed out and attached to Cara's list.  These two tags were flowing through the CISO and needed to be checked out day ahead by PacifiCorp and the ISO.  Unfortunately the ISO and PAC needed real tags not delayed tags in order to allow PACs schedule to flow.  Therefore per my discussion with Dick Dowdy at PAC, he has created a tag showing the total of 35 MW coming out of his system (tag # 9152Y) in order to check out with the ISO.  
THE REAL TIME GROUP MUST DO THE FOLLOWING ON THE PAC TAGS: 1. send the delayed tags out prior to the times indicated on Cara's sheet but no sooner than 4 hrs prior to energy flow.  2.  On the pacificorp tags referenced above, please call PAC after sending the delayed tags and tell them to kill their tag number 9152Y.      3. Call the ISO to inform them of the tag change and give them the delayed tag numbers.  4.  call PSCO and inform them you have submitted the tags.  

Please make sure this is happens !    If this is not taken care of the schedule won't flow and  Enron will be charged liquidated damages by PacifiCorp.  If you have ANY questions regarding these tags or any other tags on Cara's list, do not hesitate to contact Cara, Bill, or myself on this matter.  


Cheers,
