Notification of Operating Procedure Update

*	The following new or revised ISO Operating Procedures have been
implemented and are posted for reference on the ISO Website.

ISO Operating Procedure posted:  T-152 Huntington Beach Power Plants 1-4
Split Bus Operation
Version: 1.0
Effective Date: 8-16-2001
Procedure Purpose: The previously inactive Huntington Beach units 3 and 4
have been re-powered and are scheduled to be in service August 2001.  The
existing units 1, 2 and 5 presently provide 563 MW of power.  The added
re-powered units, rated 220 MW each, achieve a total plant capacity of 1003
MW.  If all units, including units 3 and 4, are concurrently on-line,
additional stress will be placed on the 230 kV circuit breakers (CBs) at
Huntington Beach, Hinson, and Villa Park substations, thereby exceeding
their rated interrupting capability.  This procedure will provide guidelines
for operation of the Huntington Beach 230 kV buses in order to reduce short
circuit duty contribution from the Huntington Beach units.
Changes / Reasons: see attached
 <<T-152 Procedure Change Description V1.0.doc>>
