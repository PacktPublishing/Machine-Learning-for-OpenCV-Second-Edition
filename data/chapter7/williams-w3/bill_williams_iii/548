After the Day ahead market ran, the branch group PDCI (TNOB) TTC in the
(N-S) direction was changed from 2875 MW to 1956 MW for HE's 0700 through
1200 for operating day 7/26/01.  The reason for the change is the Celilo
Converter #1 DC harmonic filters is out of service.  The first applicable
Hour Ahead market to run with these values is HE 0000.  The ISO will update
you of any changes in line rating status.  Sent by Market Operations,
inquiries please call the Hour Ahead Desk.

The system conditions described in this communication are dynamic and
subject to change.  While the ISO has attempted to reflect the most current,
accurate information available in preparing this notice, system conditions
may change suddenly with little or no notice.
