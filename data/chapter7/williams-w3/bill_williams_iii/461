After the Day ahead market ran, the COI branch group TTC in the (N-S)
direction was changed from 4100MW to 4000MW, Path 15 branch group TTC in the
(N-S) direction was changed from 1275MW to 1100MW, and the Midway-Vincent
branch group TTC in the (N-S) direction was changed from 3000MW to 2500MW.
These
changes are for HE1300 through HE2100 for operating day 07/31/01. The reason
for the change is Line outage. The first applicable Hour Ahead market to run
with these values is HE 1800. Cuts will be made in Real Time for HE1300
through HE1700. The ISO will update you of any changes in line rating
status. Sent by ISO Market Operations.

The system conditions described in this communication are dynamic and
subject to change.  While the ISO has attempted to reflect the most current,
accurate information available in preparing this notice, system conditions
may change suddenly with little or no notice.
