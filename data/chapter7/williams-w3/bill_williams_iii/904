For those of you that were not on this weekend I would like to inform you of a new possibility for sales. Transalta buys at both SP 15 and Mead 230 in both cases they plan to export to Lugo/Victorville. Since they ask to buy this power transmission contingent we can wheel through the ISO from PV to Lugo (ISO ID LUGO_5_VICTVL). They will pay a premium to get the power at lugo and they will buy the power transmission contingent. Have fun with it.
