Guys-

  Fran and I have just noticed that two of the deals remarketed real-time were put on the ST NW book and the third was put on the W Hourly book.

  We need to get together and chat so that we can keep this consistent and make sure that the right books recognize the changes.

  Let me know if you will have time this afternoon by 3.
 If not, let's plan to meet tomorrow.

  Thanks,

  Virginia
