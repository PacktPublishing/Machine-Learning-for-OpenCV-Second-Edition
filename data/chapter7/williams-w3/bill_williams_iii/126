Because we're under close watch by El Paso, would you mind looking over this e-mail to Kathy before I send it out? Thanks....

Kathy -

I requested tapes for 8/17 to verify the amount we purchased from SRP, and attached wave files that have Bert buying firm power (Vanessa at SRP said she'd need to run her turbines for three hours in order to sell at all) for HE 16-18. 40 mw went to you and the rest was sold elsewhere at Four-Corners. Our records also show we bought 50 mw on peak from SRP to cover the lending deal for that day. So total SRP purchase for HE 17 is 90 mw (50 mw lending deal + 40 mw purchase to maintain reliability requirements). 

I'm working with our IT department to get a tape of Todd reporting these numbers to the El Paso dispatchers - I'll let you know as soon as we find that. In the meantime, do you have anything more specific from SRP as to why they believe we only purchased 40 mw of econ energy for HE 17? I'm just not finding anything to support that.

Thanks,
Kate
