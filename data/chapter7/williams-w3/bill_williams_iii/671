Group,

Delano suffered a unit outage at approximately 1200 PDT on Thursday, 7/12.  Pandol Unit 1 went down due to a boiler tube leak.  They expect the unit to return around 1200 PDT on Friday, 7/13.  They were prescheduled at 45mw on-peak Thursday, 30mw off-peak Thursday, and 30mw all day on Friday.  Because of the unit outage they are only able to produce a total of 25mw.  Bert has already purchased 20mw through HE22 to cover their peak schedule.  Please purchase 5mw for HE23 on Thursday through HE12 on Friday to cover their Friday schedule.  Before you do this call the control room to see if they are still expecting to be down through HE12 on Friday.  They sold day-ahead at $56.  Please try to purchase for less than $56, while still taking $5 for yourselves (for example, if you can purchase for $45, then sell it to Delano at $50).

Also, we told the ISO that they would only be down through HE24 on Thursday, so they wouldn't cut our day-ahead schedule.  You need to call the ISO real-time generation desk (916-351-2488) this evening around 10pm to tell them that you had to purchase replacement power for Delano through HE12 on Friday.  Once again you might want to call the control room just before you call the ISO to confirm that they will be returning around HE12 on Friday.

If you have any questions please feel free to call me.

Thanks,
Stan
