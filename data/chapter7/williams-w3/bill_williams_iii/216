El Paso lending is on for Friday and Saturday - see yesterday's e-mail. (I made one mistake. The second deal should be STSW, not STWBOM, buys EPE.) Following is a detail of the short positions we have for Sunday and Monday.

In the southwest:
STWBOM and STSW will each be 25 mw short on peak at PV for Monday at a price of $51.50. Proceed as usual, and fill shorts under the appropriate desk. Please see me if you have any questions about this procedure.

	737722 - STWBOM buys EPE
		 On Peak/PV
		 25 mw @ $51.50

	737758 - STSW buys EPE
		 On Peak/PV
	 	 25 mw @ $51.50

In the northwest:
We also have a lending agreement at Mid-C on Monday - STWBOM and STNW will each be 25 mw short off peak at Mid-C at a price of $34.50 (Sean's curve price minus PGE's $1.50 lending fee). Unlike with El Paso lending, we have not entered a place-holder purchase in the day-ahead market, so we'll be short in position manager 50 mw off peak at Mid-C. Please fill these shorts under the appropriate desk. 

In California:
Also, STWBOM is short at SP15 50 mw RTC Sunday, 50 mw off peak and 25 mw on peak Monday. Prices are $45.16 on peak and $35.79 off peak. Fill these short positions under the STWBOM book.

Let me know if you have questions.
