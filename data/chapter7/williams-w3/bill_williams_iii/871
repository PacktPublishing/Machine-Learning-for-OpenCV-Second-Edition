Hey Bill, 
Eric Linder and Craig Dean have requested for me to order new cell phones for them.   
I told them I would have to run it by you first.   Craig is actually in dire need of a 
new phone, his phone doesn't even ring.  It's pretty damaged.   I will wait until
I here further more from you to order these.

In the future is there a procedure you would like me to go through to order new cell phones
for these guys? 

Thanks, Jill
