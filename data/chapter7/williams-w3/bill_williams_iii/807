Gentlemen,

West Services is short 19mw around-the-clock on Sunday and light-load Monday (7/1-7/2), as well as 23mw on-peak Monday (7/2).  We are short in SP15, at $80 on-peak and $64.25 off-peak.  We would like to either purchase the power through an SC to SC trade, or go against the ISO Imbalance, depending upon market conditions.  The associated enpower deal #'s are 669407, 669596, and 669752.  I will call in on Saturday evening to discuss market conditions and to make a decision on what needs to be done.

Thanks,
Stan
