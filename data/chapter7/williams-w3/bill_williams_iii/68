Bill I sent this email as well to the wrong Bill Williams.  I am forwarding this email for your information.  I have received a response from Kate indicating she will get to them however she is extremely busy.  

If there is anything I can do to help resolve these issues please let me know.

Please find attached an excel spreadsheet of Bloomberg deals I can't seem to match up with our deals in Enpower.  This is for August 1 through August 22.   None of these deals have Bloomberg as the Broker in Enpower.  I was told in June to allow a two day grace period before the deals should be in Enpower and that did not occur.

Please let me know if there is anything I can do to help resolve these problems.
