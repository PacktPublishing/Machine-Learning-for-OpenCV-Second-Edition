Sunday we were deficient 10 hours. I talked to Bill Williams at ENRON, he
said he would check into what was going on. After running the numbers for
each hour I found the following...

HE 11:00  Not deficient...
HE 12:00  Not deficient...
HE 13:00  Not deficient...
The first three hours were close but weren't deficient.

HE 14:00 Deficient...  18 MW's deficient... needed a 25 MW purchase

HE 15:00 Deficient...  21 MW's deficient... ENRON purchased 25 MW's
non-firm...  If firm, 25 MW purchase would have been sufficient

HE 16:00 Deficient...  24 MW's deficient... ENRON purchased 50 MW's
non-firm...    25 MW  firm purchase  would have been sufficient

HE 17:00 Deficient...  21 MW's deficient... ENRON purchased 50 MW's
non-firm...    25 MW  firm purchase  would have been sufficient

HE 18:00 Deficient...  4 MW's deficient... ENRON purchased 50 MW's
non-firm...      25 MW  firm purchase  would have been sufficient

HE 20:00 Deficient...  34 MW's deficient... ENRON purchased 50 MW's
non-firm...    35 MW  firm purchase  would have been sufficient

HE 21:00 Deficient...  44 MW's deficient... ENRON purchased 50 MW's
non-firm...    50 MW  firm purchase  would have been sufficient

Please see the attached work sheets and feel free to check my calculations.
We have until 10:00 in the morning to dispute any of the above
deficiencies!
In total we were deficient 7 hours on Sunday.  Any questions or comments
please call me at 2245 or 915-204-1202
