The following e-mail will give you details of the lending agreement we've had in place with El Paso for the past two weeks. Please skim for content and PLEASE ENTER ALL RELATED DEALS UNDER THE SAME DESK. SEVERAL DEALS HAVE BEEN ENTERED INCORRECTLY EVERY DAY THIS WEEK. PURCHASES MADE UNDER ONE BOOK MUST BE SOLD UNDER THE SAME BOOK.

725506 - STWBOM buys EPE
	 25 MW @ $59
	 On Peak/PV

725507 - STWBOM sells STSW
	 25 MW @ $59 
	 On Peak/PV

725511 - STSW buys EPE
	 25 MW @ $59
	 On Peak/PV

Definitely ask me if you have ANY questions. My main concern regarding the mistakes we've made lately is that one very small indiscretion on our part can turn into hours of extra work for the Risk Group. They don't like that.

Thanks for your attention to this matter,
Kate
