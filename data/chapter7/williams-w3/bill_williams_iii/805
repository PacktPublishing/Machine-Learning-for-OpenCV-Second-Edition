BEWARE -

Effective today, we will be taking over BOTH - not just the standard ONE - phone lines for El Paso during off peak hours and on weekends. This means we'll get calls that would previously have been directed to Roger and Steve's cell phones. All calls will still ring in on the EL PASO line. Please read the e-mail in Lotus Notes titled "EPE MARKETING AVAILABILITY" for details. 

And let me know if you have questions.

Thanks,
Kate
