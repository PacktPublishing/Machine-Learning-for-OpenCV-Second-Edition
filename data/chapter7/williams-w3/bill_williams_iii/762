To all -

I've trued up the El Paso model and Enpower for June. Most of these variances were simple adjustments to the model, and we should be variance-free for June at this point. Also, I've notified the Real Time traders that we will re-instate the El Paso reconciliation model as of July 1. 

Please call me with questions.  

Thanks for your support and patience -
