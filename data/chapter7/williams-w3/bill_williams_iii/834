I've entered these deals into Enpower to cover line loss payback to APS -

	Buy from EPE - 665557
	Sell to APS - 665565

The guys on shift tonight need to enter a price into the buy side. Nothing needs to be done to the sale side. Please let me know if you have questions.

Thanks,
Kate

Group,
For 06/28 only:

We need to send APS losses, 2 mws for HE 1 at 4C345 from EPE.  Lisa Gang has put this in the sheet and made a preschedule tag.  We need to make a buy from EPE under ST-Whourly in Enpower, and a sale to APS at zero in Enpower.  Please make sure this schedule is in as losses.  You can call me with any questions.

Thanks,

Bill
