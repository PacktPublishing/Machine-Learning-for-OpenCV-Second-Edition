Just wanted to let you know that Geir and I sold the Frontier Unit for the 12th.  We sold 8 MW due to the fact that the services book said it was available to sell Real Time.  However around 3:10 in the morning BPA called and gave us a tag number to look at and it showed the unit sold day ahead.  Just thought you might like a heads up on this issue because you will probably hear about it from Les or someone else.

Call me if you have any issues.

Bert
