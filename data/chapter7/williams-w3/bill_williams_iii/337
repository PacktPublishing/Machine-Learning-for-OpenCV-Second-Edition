Good Morning,

If you are changing any deals that are currently flowing, please notify prescheduling of the change and deal number.  Small changes can cost us hours of work trying to find a change in balance.

The Preschedulers have a distribution list  DL-Portland Prescheduling.


If you have any questions, please see me.
