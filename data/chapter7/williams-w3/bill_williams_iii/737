Hello there mister Bill!

Just a quick note to say sorry for getting off of the phone so quickly
yesterday!  To get into my apartment you have to go through a security gate
that needs to be opened by a resident.  I didn't have my pass code and I had
a visitor.  So I was scrammbling around like a lunatic trying to find it.
Most everyone who comes to visit knows the pass code so when someone new
comes to visit I have to try to remember what it is!  Then enter it into the
phone to let them in!  I think I've used it like twice in the year I've
lived here!  Anyhow so that's that!

To be quite honest with you I was so frazzled that I have no idea what you
said you needed to do or if you said I could call back after a certain time.
My mind was just focused on that code!  I thought I remembered that you
couldn't talk to me the rest of the day.  That's why I didn't call.  Ok
there's all the excuses and apologies.

Hope you're having a great day!

Nikki
