Gentlemen -

Lending agreement with EPE has us short 50 mw on peak @ Palo tomorrow (25 mw under STWBOM, 25 mw under STSW). Reduce both purchase prices (713238 and 713246) to $4 after buying the power in the hour-ahead market. Sell back to El Paso @ $0. Deals are as follows:

713238 - STWBOM buys EPE
	 HLH/PV
	 25 MW @ $57

713244 - STWBOM sells STSW
	 HLH/PV
	 25 MW @ $57

713246 - STSW buys EPE
	 HLH/PV
	 25 MW @ $57

Also,
Short Term West BOM and STCA will each be short 25 mw tomorrow - on peak SP15 @ $49.69. Kysa will be entering those deals. Please let me know if you have questions.

Thanks,
Kate
