Bill - 

Just a reminder, as Craig, Eric, and Steven all started after 12/31/00, they will not be receiving a performance raring for mid-year.  You will still need to complete a formal review with each employee and set goals for the remainder of the year.

If you have any questions or need additional information, please let me know.
