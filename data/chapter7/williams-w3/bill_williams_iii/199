Group,

Whoever is working Monday evening, 8/20, could you please call the ISO real-time desk at midnight to tell them that Harbor is coming off-line per the beginning of their temporary waiver outage.  I called the ISO today to request a temporary waiver for Harbor.  It was granted for two days, beginning HE1 on Tuesday, 8/21.  Which means they are temporarily waived from the "must offer" prevision of the FERC order for that time period.  The ISO requested that someone from real-time call to confirm that Harbor was going off-line (although they are already off-line, just tell them that they are going to begin their scheduled temporary waiver outage).

Thanks,
Stan
