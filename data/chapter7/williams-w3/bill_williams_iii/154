Heather,

I participate in this every year with my previous employer. Since moving from Eugene I now commute on the MAX. I would like to commute with my bike on MAX and perhaps the think to do is ride to the MAX and get off the train a few miles outside town and ride in. Do you know if the  Bicycle Transportation Alliance has coordinated with TriMet on this event?  

In any case, count me in. I'll be riding every day.

Jeff
