Amy, 

Attached is Seth Christensen's resume.  Deb Chereck (Career Services) sent me the note below.  Please note that her e-mail address does not end with "@ENRON"; I don't know why that happens.

I don't know what our current hiring status is (I presume that we are set), but his GPA looks good and I can make some phone calls to faculty if we have any interest.

Todd

Todd- I asked Seth to provide me with a resume to send to you in case you 
know of anything that may be opening at Enron.  Seth is certainly one of the 
strongest finance people graduating this year so I wanted you to know about 
him.  Have a great day.
