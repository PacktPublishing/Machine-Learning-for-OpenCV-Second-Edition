To all -

I just received a call from Thresa Allen in Houston regarding a Louisiana-Pacific sale made by Long Term Northwest. The deal flows 2000 through 2006, and the dispute falls on 2/23 and 2/24 of this year. The 7 mw round-the-clock sale was reduced to 4 mw for HE 11-24 on 2/23 and HE 1-24 on 2/24. Louisiana is disputing this, saying we should have booked out with them for these hours. (Diana entered deals to bookout with Louisiana for 2/25-2/28 - 530268, 530334, 531224, 531549, 532573.) Thresa believes we need to enter a 3 mw purchase to complete the bookout for 2/23-2/24. 

I wanted to check with you guys before doing anything because your names are the three on the deal numbers she gave me. (Bill entered a purchase annuity from L-Pac - 531549 - for a ramp down.) 

Please let me know if any of this sounds familiar. Thresa said this dispute was filed back in June, so she's eager to get it resolved.

Thanks for your help,
Kate
