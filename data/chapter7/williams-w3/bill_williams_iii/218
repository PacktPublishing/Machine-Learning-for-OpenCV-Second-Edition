Roger; the following contacts will be able to assist Air Products during the term of our physical transaction scheduled to begin on 8/23/01.  


Real-Time;	1-800-684-1336 Managed by Mr. Bill Williams (503) 464-3730

Pre-Schedule;	1-877-464-7779  Managed by Cara Semperger (503) 464-3814.

Donald Robinson (503) 464-3902 and Diana Scholtes (503) 464-3807 will be involved with the "pre-scheduling" of Air Products energy.

My office phone number is (503) 464-2270 with a cellular phone number of (503) 701-0295.

A general rule of thumb would be, we pre-schedule the next day's energy by 6:30 AM PPT the day prior to delivery, except for on Thursday mornings we pre-schedule Friday and Saturday, and on Friday we pre-schedule Sunday and Monday.  Holidays are pre-scheduled by the specific Holiday but if you'll check with us in advance, we'll be able to provide with the pre-schedule deadline.  Air Products is free to make changes at anytime, and internally we will get the request to the appropriate person.

Thanks again for the opportunity to become Air Products Energy Provider of choice, let me know if you have any questions and or concerns.  

John
