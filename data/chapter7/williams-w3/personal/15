Bill,
I am having such a terrible day. I am so flustrated. Can you believe it is only monday? Ah! Anyhow, I hope your day is going much better than mine. When I saw you earlier, you looked kinda angry or something. I hope I was just imaging that. Anyhow, I'd better get back to work. I'll talk to you later.
