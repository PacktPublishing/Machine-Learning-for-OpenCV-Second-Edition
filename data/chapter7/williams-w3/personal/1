Right.  Well, work is always crazy for you I suppose.  Yeah, I'm getting
ready to move.  This is my last week of work at the restaurant (thank god!)
and I have three weeks of class left.  I'll leave on the last day of class
(June 14) bright and early in the morning and drive west until I hit CO.
Still don't have a place to live, but I'm working on that.

I'll probably be coming back to Portland for a weekend or so during the
summer sometime so I'll look you up when I get there, if you want.

Good luck with work, I know you're doing a great job.

Christel
