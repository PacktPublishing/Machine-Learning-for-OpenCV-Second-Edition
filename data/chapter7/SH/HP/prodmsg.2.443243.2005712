Dear Sir/Madam,
We are Rev Thomas & Racael David, we print christian books and export to =
Europe/America. We are searching for a christain representative who can help =
us establish a medium of getting to our costumers in America/Canada as well =
as recieving payments due to our ministry. Our clients find it difficult to =
release payments to us because they find it difficult to make wire transfer =
or we have no representative closer to recieve checks from. But with you =
around, they can easily send the funds to you if we tell them that you are =
our christain brother/sister. 
If you are interested in representing our ministry, we will be very glad as =
you shall be entitled to 5% of every total amount you recieve for us. =
Directives would be given to you on how to send the funds across to us.
Please contact us for more information. Subject to your satisfaction you will =
be given the opportunity to negotiate the mode of which we will pay for your =
services as our representative in America. There is no more responsibility =
than this like travelling to meet them or spending money from your pocket.
I hereby request you forward any proof of your identities, your current =
telephone and fax numbers including your forwarding address to establish =
trust and business relationship and also to enable us inform our clients to =
communicate with you.
Thanks,
Remain blessed
