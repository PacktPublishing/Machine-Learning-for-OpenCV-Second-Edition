Dear Sir/Madam,

account of the federal pay office to your account as soon as possible.
 
Source of the funds are:  
 
During the Arap Moi's government, government's officials awarded contracts to =
their own companies; these contracts were grossly over invoiced. Now the =

totaling US$ 370m (Three hundred and seventy million us dollars) oversea.
 
We would want US$20.8m (Tweenty million Eight Hundred Thousand) dollars out =
this money oversea transferred to your account because we are not eligible to =
operate foreign account, and I have been mandated to search for a partner =
abroad. We really want this transfer made as soon as possible before the =

track this money. We will be offering 20% for your assistance.
