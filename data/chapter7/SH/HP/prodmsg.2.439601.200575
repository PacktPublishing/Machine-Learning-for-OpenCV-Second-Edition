          Sheets:SPNI), dba American Football Alumni Inc., (AFA) (http://www.americanfootballalumni.com/) 
          is a Nevada membership based &quot;for profit&quot; corporation. AFA membership 
          is composed of former high school varsity, collegiate and professional 
          football players and coaches and all others who actively support the 
          sport. </font></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The American Football Alumni (&quot;AFA&quot;) is a 
      member-based organization in service and support of former and current 
      football players and football programs. AFA is a formulation of a 
      fraternal group of individuals, sharing a common bond, whose foundation is 
      based upon an intangible passion for football and all that it means to 
      have played and lived it. AFA membership is not limited to or meant to be 
      for only the most elite players or the most recognized, but for every 
      player, coach, support staff, fan or family member that have dedicated 
      their selves to the game of football. Eligibility for AFA enrollment and 
      membership is open to all those individuals having participated in and/or 
      lettered a minimum of one season at the high school varsity level or 
      above. Affiliate memberships will also be available with limited features 
      to those who avidly support football. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">AFA</font><font face="Arial" size="2"> was 
      formed with three goals integral to our corporate charter. RECOGNITION: to 
      provide information and support services to former football players, 
      coaches and supporters as it pertains to their lives and future. 
      AWARENESS: to provide a vehicle to assist AFA members in supporting the 
      football program at the schools they attended. INVOLVEMENT: provide a 
      means to give former football players and coaches, as a whole, a continued 
      presence and voice in the ongoing culture of American football. </font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">One of our most important services will be 
      working as a unified voice and lobbying group. AFA members will have an 
      opportunity to vote for college as well as local high school football 
      polls. This is long over due as the football alumni more than all other 
      bodies will give the most realistic evaluation of teams. Further to 
      providing a voice, it has been long needed to have an organization like 
      the AFA to affect influence on subjects such as rule changes in college 
      and high school football, as well as providing input on national issues 
      such as schools and leagues dropping or changing there support of football 
      and the student athletes. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Membership Benefits will include the 
      following: </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">AFA</font><font face="Arial" size="2"> Home

      will allow members to opt-in to cross-market their businesses with each 
      other offering discounts and opportunities to other members through our 
      member network marketing program. The potential of AFA's resulting effect 
      is enormous. Many alumni reconnections have led to successful business

      Alumnipoll(r) will be member driven by those who lived and know the sport.

      be more informed, more insightful, and valuable to grade the talent, the 
      teams and the coaches. Those in sports radio, print and television to be 
      indicators of the true talent and achievement will quickly rely upon AFA 
      polls. </font></p>
