IT'S OFFICIAL!
<p>You have been pre-approved to participate on <br>
  this year's risk free test play program. As <br>
  you probably know, this program entitles you <br>

  the general public. Obviously our research <br>
  department requires your honest evaluation of <br>
  the golf equipment you will be receiving. <br>
  Your player ID# is DC19. Call us as soon as <br>
  possible at 1-800-600-5113 for all the details!</p>
